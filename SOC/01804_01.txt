SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

Thursday, January 12, 1939.
The Parliament of Canada ýhaving been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the dispatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING

0F THE SESSION

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the

from the Governor General's Seeretary informing him that Ris Excellency the Governor
General would proceed to the Senate Chamber
te open the session of the Dominion Parliament this day at three o'clock.
APPOINTMENT 0F CLERK 0F
THE SENATE
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that a commission under the Great
Seal had been granted te Leslie
Clare Moyer,'
Esquire, D.S.O., K.C., appointing himi the
Clerk of the Senate of Canada te be known
and designated as the Clerk of the Parliaments and Master in Chancery.
The commission was read, and Ris Honour
the Speaker administered the oath of office te

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the

D.S.0., K.C., had been appointed Commissioner under the Great Seal, to administer

The commission making this appointment

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
71498--l

At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor
General proceeded te the Senate Chamber
and took lis seat upon the Throne.
His
Excellency was pleased te command the at.
tendance of the House of Commons, and that
House being corne, with their Speaker, His
Excellency was pleased Vo open the Fourth
Session of the Eighteenth Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourab]e Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The announcement that Their Majesties King
George VI and Queen Elizabeth have graciously
decided te visit Canada in the months of May
and June lias been received with rejoicing
throughout the Dominion.
The honour of
welcoming their King and Queen, in person, on
their own soi, is a privilege which will be
shared with enthusiasmn and pride by ail HIis
Majesty's Canadian subjects. The visit will be
the first paid by the reigning Sovereign te any
of hie self-governing Dominions. It will be
the first time a British King and Queen have
been in North America. It is deeply gratifying
that Their Majesties' tour will embrace all the
provinces of Canada.
The official visit paid Canada in August last
by the President of the United States was the
occasion of unusually warmn demonstrations of
friendship and nnderstanding upon both sides
of our common border.
It is paricularly
pleasing te the citizens of our country that the
King and Queen have found it possible te
accept the invitation of the President te visit
the United States before the conclusion of
their Canadian tour.
My Ministers have found it necessary te give
anxious and continuons consideration te developments in the international situation and their
effects upon Canada. Our own relations with
other countries continue friendly, but the
aggressive policies actively pursued in other
continents have inevitably had a disturbing
effect upon every part of the world.
The Government shared in the general sense
of relief that the appalling disaster of war,
whîch threatened Europe during the month
of September last, was averted, and in the
recognition which that crisis manif ested of
the widespread will of the peoples for peace.
They are hopef ni that the efforts now being
made te find a solution for the specific differences which are causing friction will meet with
success. They recognize, nevertheless, that time
is required for these forces te work, and that

ICYISED EDITION

the possibility of further tension in the meantime must be faced. In this situation, the
Government have considered that the uncertainties of the future, and the conditions of modern
warfare, make it imperative that Canada's
defences be materially strengthened.
Two years ago, the appropriations for defence
were substantially increased, and a beginning
made on a programme of modernization to
safeguard the country from the dangers of
attack. The Government intend to pursue this
policy vigorously, and to propose to Parliament
that the programme of defence should be
further augmented, and that particular emphasis
should be laid upon air defence.
Legislation will be introduced to establish a
Defence Purchasing Board with power to purchase equipment for the defence services and
to ensure that, where private manufacture is
necessary, profits in conection with such are
fair and reasonable, and that the public interest
is protected.
While taking the measures necessary to assure
the

maintenance

of

our

national

integrity

against the possibility of external aggression,
the Government have sought in positive ways
to strengthen the mutual interests which unite
Canada in friendly relations with other
countries.
You vill be asked to approve the trade
agreement with tihe United States of America,
signed at Washington on Novenber 17, 1938.
This agreement fulfils the hope expressed in
the Speech from the Throne, last year, for an
agreement with the United States, which would
confirm and enlarge the advantages of the
agreement concluded in 1935.
Simultaneously with the conclusion of the
new agreement between Canada and the United
States, a far-reaching agreement was effected
between the United States and the United
Kingdom. Taken together, the agreements constitute a constructive contribution toward a
betterment of world conditions. It is deeply
gratifying to the Governsent that in their
efforts to increase, and to ensure over a longer
period of tine, the advantages to Canadian
producers and consumers secured in earlier
agreements, they were able, at the same time,
to further the ends of international good-will.
The Canada-United States agreements have
involved, in addition to the wider markets
secured for Canadian products, a thoroughgoing revision of the Canadian tariff structure,
and a reduction of taxes on trade much greater
than that made by any previous Parliament, or
by any other country in recent years.
Notice has been given, effective December 31,
1939, terminating the Canada-West Indies
agreement concluded in 1925. My Ministers
hope that negotiations will shortly he entered
upon leading to a new agreement which will
be mutually beneficial to the West Indian
Colonies and to Canada. In connection therewith the Tariff Board bas been directed to make
a careful examination of the sugar preferences
and duties.
Unemployment in Canada continues to receive
the unremitting attention of local, provincial
and federal authorities. Having regard to the
existing division of powers and obligations
under the British North Ainerica Act, responsibility for unemployment and the solution of
its problems is necessarily divided. There has
been an increasing assumption of obligations
on tIse part of tie Federal Government.

Employaient in war industry and the reginientation of masses of men for purposes of war
have, to appearances, afforded in some countries
a solution of their problem of unemployment.
In Canada other methods of dealing with the
problem have been followed.
The Dominion Government have taken active
measures to stimulate private employment
through the Home Imaprovement Plan, the
National Housing Act, and the Municipal Improvements Assistance Act. Under these measures certain local taxes have been assumed, and
loans made to individuals, organizations and
municipalities. The sales tax bas been eliminated on important building materials. Special
aid bas been given to the mining industry by
subventions, tax exemptions and improved
transportation facilities. At the same time,
direct employnsent bas been increased through
a substantial expansion of federal public works,
and through assistance given to the provinces
in the construction of highways. for land settlement. for special projects for farma employment
and for forest conservation.
Provision bas also been made by the Dominion
Government for grants-in-aid to the provinces
to assist in the care of those suffering frons
unemployment and agricultural distress.
The various measures adopted to stimulate
emaploynsent and afford relief to those in need
have operated most suecessfully in those provinces which have supported them withs full
co-operation.
In Canada. the problem of unemployment
ias been aggravated in recent years by recurrent
crop failures in the Western Provinces, and
by the serious business recession experienced
in tie last year in other parts of the world.
The intensification of the problem bas set forth
iii bold relief the obstacles which the existing
division of constitutional authority places in
the way of a solution.
The report of the Commission on Dominion-

Provincial Relations

vill be presented to Par-

lianent iii the course of the present session.
In accordance with the purpose for which the
commission vas inistituted, its report will provide the basis for, and the material essential
to the deliberations of a national conference,
at which, among the important subjects to be
dealt with, will be the problem of unemployusent and social services generally. The Government have not altered their view that a
national unemployment insurance schene is
essential to a pernanent policy of meeting the
problem of unemployment.
My Ministers recognize that the plight of
those who are still unemployed cannot await
necessary constitutional aiencdients, nor the
They are presummoning of any conference.
pared, therefore, notwithstanding constitutional

impediments

to effective action, to join with

the provinces in a further determined effort to
meet the immediate situation.
To this end it is proposed further to expand
the Government's long-range programme of
public undertakings. In pursuance of .the policy

of the active encouragement of employment, it
is also proposed to undertake, with provincial

co-operation, to provide assistance to municipalitics which, as an alternative to the provision
of direct relief, desire to expand their normal
programmes of civie improvements.

JANUARY 12, 1939
As a means of providing an opportunity for
useful work and national service to single unemployed men, the assistance given to forest conservation will be extended to include other
work of national importance.
The beneficial results of the Youth Training
programme have demonstrated the wisdom of
this experiment, and a measure will be introduced to increase its efficiency and expand its
usefulness.
Notwithstanding the embarrassments and
handicaps encountered in coping with the problem of unemployment, it is gratifying to be
able to record that, during the past year, there
has been a material reduction in the number
of those receiving agricultural aid, and a
reduction also in the total number of those
receiving public assistance due to unemployment
and agricultural distress. At the beginning of
the present winter the number of those receiving such public assistance was almost forty per
cent less than two years ago. Over the same
period the number of persons actually in employment has largely increased.
Continuous improvement in the position of
the fishing industry as a whole has been reflected in annual increases for the past few
years in the aggregate amounts received by the
fishermen from their work. The Department
of Fisheries have given, and will continue to
give, increased attention to the problem of
marketing. The Government have also assisted
fishermen substantially through direct aid.
In order to avert economic disaster to a large
part of our population, my Ministers, under
the teris of the Wheat Board Act, approved,
for the current crop year, an initial payment
for wheat as recommended by the Board.
The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Plan will
be continued, the experience of the past year
having demonstrated its efficacy in improving
the agricultural areas of the West.
Bills will be introduced to regulate grain
exchanges along the lines laid down in the
Report of the Royal Commission on Grain
Marketing, to revise the Canada Grain Act,
and to assist further in the marketing of farm
products.
The Trans-Canada Airways will shortly provide a passenger service, in addition to the air
mail and air express services already in operation. Preparations for the inauguration of
the Transatlantic Air Service are being actively

of the United Kingdom and of Ireland.
In order to implement the recommendations
of the Royal Commission to Investigate the

RADIO BROADCASTING
REFUSAL OF BROADCASTING PRIVILEGES
TO NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

Honourable

senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I should like to make a statement to
the House concerning the radio broadcasting
incident of last week.
Honourable members have doubtless seen
reports in the press to the effect that the Government had refused the privilege of broadcasting to the publisher of one of Canada's leading
newspapers. I simply wish to say that the
Government bas had nothing whatever to do
with refusing any application that bas been
made to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Neither the Government nor any
member of the Government had any knowledge that an application had been made
to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
by the publisher of one of Toronto's leading
newspapers, nor had any member of the
Government any knowledge that such an
application had'been refused.
As honourable members know, the business
of controlling and regulating radio broadcasting bas been placed by this Parliament

SENATE
under the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
which is an autonomous public body and with
which the Government does not interfere and
has no desire to interfere. The General
Manager of the Corporation has issued to the
press a statement which gives a full explanation of the application itself and the grounds
on which it was refused. I have in my hand a
copy of the statement and if honourable
members will take it as read I shall place it
on the Table that it may be printed in
Hansard with the remarks I have made. The
statement is one which, I think, will be of
interest to honourable senators.
CBC Statement given to the Press by Mr.
Gladstone Murray, General Manager of the
CBC, January 5, 1939.
Mr. George McCullagh applied to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to buy time for
a series of broadcast talks on the national network of the Corporation in order to give hie
views on public questions. The application was
refused in accordance with the policy of the
Corporation in dealing with controversial broadcasts. This policy is based on the principle
of encouraging the free discussion of all subjects
of public interest in round-table discussions,
debates, talks, and forums, for whicl the Corporation provides time without charge. No
individual may purchase any network to broadcast his own opinions and no profit-making
corporation may purchase any network to
broadcast opinions. Far from being a restraint
on free speech, the Corporation's policy is an
assurance that liberty of discussion is preserved,
that alI main points of view are fairly presented, and that the possession of wealth does
not confer the right to use network broadcasting to influence opinion.
Having failed to secure time on the national
network, Mr. McCullagh attempted to buy time
over a network of privately-owned stations.
As all network broadcasting in Canada is under
the control of the Corporation, under the
specific authority of the Canadian Broadeasting
Act of 1936, the permission of the Corporation
would have been required to give effect to the
new plan. As the saine general principle in
controversial broadcasts applies to all netwerks
in Canada, the second application was also
refused.
Mr. McCullagh had already been invited to
participate in the Corporation's Sunday evening
National Forum at no cost to him. Mr. McCullagh declined the invitation, which, however. remains open.
The Corporation's decision and the reasons
for it were communicated to Mr. MeCullagli
in a letter, dated January 5, which is now
released for publication.
The decision was taken by the Corporation
on its own responsibility in accordance with the
policy laid down by the Board. of Governors.
It is pointed out that the Corporation's policy
regarding this class of network broadcasting is
similar to that of the National Broadcastin"
Company of the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

On the same date Mr. Gladstone Murray
wrote the following letter to Mr. McCullagh:
Ottawa, Ontario,
January 5, 1939.

Dear Mr. McCullagh:
Thank you for your letter of the 4th instant.
I shall be glad to set out fully the reasons why
the Corporation was obliged to reject your
application to purchase network time for the
purpose of placing your views on public questions before the listeners of Canada.
In order that the answer may be complete,
it is necessary to indicate the origin and evolution of the policy upon which it is based.
As you know, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation was established by Act of Parliament as a non-partisan public trust to control
all broadcasting in Canada in the public interest. In accordance with this purpose the Corporation was endowed with exclusive control
of all network broadcastng and with a general
responsibility for the character and content of
all programs.
The relevant provisions of The Canadian
Broadcasting Act, 1936, respecting the control
and direction of network broadcasting are paragraphs 21 and 22, as follows:
"21. No private station shall operate in
Canada as a part of a chain or network of
stations except with the permission of, and in
accordance with the regulations made by the
Corporation.

"22. (1) The Corporation may make regulations:
(a) to control the establishment and operation of chains or networks of stations in
Canada."
The relevant provisions of the Act relating
to the Corporation's control of all matters
broadcast in Canada is section 22 (1) (c), (d),
and (e)

as follows:

"22. (1) The Corporation may make regulations:
(c) te control the character of any and alI
programs broadcast by corporation or private
stations;
(d) to determine the proportion of time
which may be devoted to advertising in any
programs broadcast by the stations of the
Corporation or by private stations, and to control the character of such advertising;
(e) to prescribe the proportion of time which
may be devoted to political broadcasts by the
stations of the Corporation and by private
stations, and to assign sueh time on any equitable basis to all parties and rival candidates."
I have

deliberately set out the

above pro-

visions in order to indicate the intentions of
Parliament. That the authority vested in the
Corporation bas been exercised as intended is
perhaps best illustrated by the following quotation from the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Broadcasting of 1938:
"The bulk of the evidence concerned the
program, technical and financial policies of the
Corporation. Your committee is of the opinion
that these policies are well designed te carry
out the purpose for which the Corporation was
created. Your committee is also of the opinion
that the policies of the Corporation are being
executed in a business-like fashion."

JANUARY 17, 1939
Now, a brief outline of CBC policy respecting the discussion of public problems and issues
and the position generally in the related fields
of party political, and non-party controversial
broadcasting.
On the first point, the Broadcasting Act, as
you know, requires the Corporation to prescribe
regulations for all broadcasting, both on privately-owned and CBC stations. No censorship is imposed, restrictions being confined to
those specifically set out in the regulations.
The policy of the Corporation is to encourage
the fair presentation of controversial questions,
which indeed is regarded as part of the educational function. To this end there are organized
round tables, talks, discussions, debates, commentaries and forums, distributed through CBC
stations and networks.
Moreover, facilities
have been provided on a sustaining basis for
organizations such as the Canadian Association of Adult Education and the Workers'
Educational Association. Individual privatelyowned stations are encouraged to discharge
similar public service on a local basis.
With regard to party political broadcasting
during elections, new arrangements under consideration will aim to have issues and policies
placed more adequately before the whole electorate. Individual privately-owned and CBC
stations will remain commercially obtainable to
rival parties and candidates, subject to the
relevant provisions of The Canadian Broadcasting Act and the regula-tions issued thereunder.
With respect to party political broadcasting
between elections, any legal political party may
purchase time either on networks or individual
stations. Non-party statements of political leaders of sufficient general interest are carried
by the Corporation on a sustaining basis.
Rulings recently approved by the Board of
Governors regarding the sponsorship of nonparty controversial broadcasts are as follows:
"<(1) No individual may purchase any network to broadcast his own opinions;
(2) No profit-making corporation may purchase any network to broadcast opinions;
(3) Properly constituted societies may purchase network time subject to the following
conditions:
(a)
that the society accepts
responsibility for the broadcast, indemnifying
the CBC against the possible consequences of
libel or slander; (b) that each broadcast is
prefaced and concluded by an appropriate
announcement making clear the nature and
auspices of the broadcast and indicating that
equivalent facilities are available to opposing
views on the same basis; (c) that there is no
interference with normal CBC program arrangements; (d) that the broadcast is of sufficient
popular appeal and interest to justify its
inclusion; (e) that the broadcast is within the
wording and spirit of our regulations and not
in violation of any law."
These rulings, which apply also to individual
CBC stations, but not to individual privatelyowned stations, were the subject of the most
careful consideration. The admission of the
right of an individual to buy network time to
propound views would entail, for example, the
approval of (a) the representative of a profitmaking corporation influencing public policy in
favour of his corporation; (b) a profit-making
corporation using opinions as a direct or indirect
sales medium; and (c) an individual sponsoring
his own opinions by virtue of the advanfage of
wealth.

5

Nothing in the above is of course intended to
suggest that the ordinary commercial facilities,
network or local, are not available to the
Globe and Mail as to any other reputable
company.
I hope you will excuse the length of this
letter. I felt that you would understand the
reasons for the decision I was obliged to take
if I were to set out the general background.
I still hope that you will feel inclined to
consider my suggestion that you participate in
occasional programs, forums or otherwise,
arranged by us. We are most anxious to make
available to our listeners the views of Canadians
with a real contribution to make to the
solution of our many national problems.
Yours sincerely,
Gladstone Murray,
General Manager.

THE

LATE

SENATORS BROWN
CASGRAIN

TRIBUTES TO THEIR

AND

MEMORY

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, it is my painful duty to inform this House of the demise of two of our
colleagues, the late Senators Brown and Casgrain. Perhaps I am specially qualified to
speak of these two gentlemen, since both were
fellow-citizens of mine in Montreal, where
they lived very near to me.
Senator Brown had come from the Eastern
Townships to study law, and be devoted himself exclusively, I should say, to that task.
He became a member of the Bar at about
the same time as I did, and he applied all his
energy to acquiring proficiency in the legal
profession.
He did so well that eventually the law firm
of whicli be was the head included twenty-four
members of the Bar. He was legal counsellor
of the most important business and financial
corporations of Montreal, and to such an extent
did be win their confidence that eventually
they made him a member of their executive
board. It will be found on reference to the
Parliamentary Guide that lie was on the directorate of more than a dozen of the larger
institutions and was vice-president of two or
three of the most important. I fear that the
onerous duties incident to the responsible positions be held undermined his health, for when
he became a member of this Chamber be was
far from robust; in fact during the last two
or thrce years. we knew, he was an invalid.
He did not raise his voice in this Chamber
nor in our committees, for two reasons: high
blood pressure and a certain shyness which
prevented him from adapting himself to public
debate. The late Senator Brown had but one
purpose in life, to reach the top of his profession, as lie did. He never appeared on the
rostrumi or before the public in any capacity
during his whole career. Consequently be felt
somewhat uneasy at the prospect of hearing
his voice within the walls of this Chamber;
the more so as the effort would have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

too great a strain on his impaired health.
As we all know, he was perfectly equipped for
the work of this House by his long association
with all the various activities, industrial and
financial, with which be was in contact in the
city of Montreal.
There is an interesting contrast between
Senator Brown's life from the day be left the
Eastern Townships, where his forbears had
settled on the land near Richmond in the first
years of the nineteenth century, and the life
of the friend who left us a few weeks laterthe late Senator Casgrain.
Senator Casgrain belonged to one of the
seigniorial families of Lower Canada that have
played an important role in the public life of
the old province and of the Union of the two
Canadas. Some of its members went beyond
the borders of the province of Quebec and
played a prominent part in the affairs of Ontario, reaching as far as Windsor and even
beyond, to Detroit, where we find important
branches of the family located. Senator Casgrain bad been brought up in an atmosphere
totally different from that in which Senator
Brown developed. His family was always in
public life. When hardly twenty years of age
be came to Ottawa with his father, a member
of the House of Commons, and became a
translator on the Commons staff. During the
few years be remained in that position he
probably spent more time in the Press Gallery
listening to the debates than he devoted to
the work of translation. As a translator he
showed rnarked ability, having a good command of both languages. In this capacity he
came into contact with the leaders and members of both parties, and when a commission
was appointed to visit the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 he was attached to it as
secretary. I have heard hinm say on many occasions that in Philadelphia and Washington he
had met men of international reputation and
many of the outstanding public men of the
United States. As engineer and surveyor he
travelled extensively in the Dominion and did
a considerable amount of survey work in the
Prairie Provinces. His work brought him into
touch witi many prominent Canadians. This
gave him a valuable background, which served
hin well when he became a member of the
Senate. As he told us, be was advised to
specialize,
and therefore devoted himself
mainly to legislation dealing with transportation, botlh rail and water, in regard to which
ie was well qualified to express an opinion.
His extensive technical knowledge and marvellous memory compelled our admiration, and
we were always grateful for the fund of information which he gave us whenever he took
part in our debates. He was a very useful
member of this Chamber, where be participated

JANUARY 17, 1939
for thirty-eight years in ail our activities. His
geniality and fund of anecdote made him the
best of companions. and we shall ail miss him
here. His loss will also be keenly feit in the
city of Montreal. We deeply regret his departure.
To Mrs. Brown and family and to Mrs.
Casgrain and children I desire to express
our most sincere sympathy.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, one is always afraid, as the
opening of Parliament approaches, that an
occasion such as the present will arise. This
time littie indeed need be added on this side
of the House to the very informative references made by the honourable leader of the
Goverament to the two distinguished members who have passed on.
I did not know Senator Brown very well.
As ail are aware, the hand of Death was close
even when hie took lis seat here for the flrst
time. He mioved in the highest business
circles of Montreal. His firm. was undoubtedly
the largest and probably the busiest of al
the law flrms of this Dominion. It was
largeiy bis own creation. But hie was more
than a lawyer. He was a business organizer,
and in the sphere of business wouid doubtless have gained even greater reward than
hie did in the sphere lie chose. In the larger
business circles of our country he stood high,
and I doubt not that bis qualifications merited
the recognition hie received. I have always
lamented that lie did not become a member
of this buse at a time when hie could have
taken an active interest in its work and looked
forward to a notable career among us.
When 1 corne to refer to Senator Casgrain my task is not easy. I think this is the
ninth session I have been here, and I do not.
know any member on either side who has.
ever extended to me such courtesies as I
always reccived from him. Nor was I the
only one. Whenever there was trouble, whenever there was need of a word of cheer,
whether to me-as rarely occurred-or to
others whom I have in mmnd, Senator Casgrain was the first on hand. His name will
be held heloved by more than one member
on this side of the House.
As the honourable leader of the Government has said, Senator Casgrain was a rem arkable man. I do not know that I ever
listened to one who could review details with
such thorough memory-command, to such
endless extent, or on such a wealth of subjects as could hie. Sometimes I questioned
just how far hie had organized this material
to, utilize it in the formation of opinion, but
that he had it at bis command was evident

7

to everyone. Further, hie was a man in every
sense of the word. I knew him pretty well.
The Casgrain family is scattered throughout
our'country, some in one province, some in
another; some of one political faith, some
of the other; but if they are ail like our
late colleague, the more of them we have in
our Dominion the better.
A French Canadian by birth, a subject
of Great Britain, hie was just as loyal to
the one relationship as to the other. Neyer
do 1 want to sec a Canadian citizen more
thoroughly loyal than was Senator Casgrain.
He knew what it meant to be a British subjeet, and how to appreciate its worth, and hae
neyer sought in any way to evade any of the
implications which that splendid titie carnies
with it. When the trial came bis family was
of course one of those earliest on the scene
of action, and one of those that achieved the
finest record.
The House can neyer be quite the same
again without him. He was a real character.
The courtesy that shone from him. was not
the flnest thing hie possessed; hie also had
bis foul share of those "wrestling thews that
throw the world." He was indeed the type
of man one likes to remember.
The family can be assured that there are
many here who wili long regret bis passing.
I join with the honourable leader of the
Government in extending also to Mrs. Brown
our very tenderest sympatby.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, to, what has heen so fittingly said of our
late colleagues I wish to add one word, a
word of farewell to lifelong companions and
truc friends.
As by the swift course of time we are carried close to the fatal hour, the disappearance
of those who entered into our daiiy life and
especialiy shared our friendship becomes more
and more painful.
Certairily such is the case for me at this
moment, whien I miss the sympatbetic smile
of Senator Casgrain across the House. Indeed, it was difficult to overlook bis presence
in our midst. His imposing appearance, bis
always youthful bearing, full of zest, appeaied
to everyone. The explanation of this might
well have been his descent from a very old
and distinguished Canadian famiiy of French
origin; also, no doubt, the fact tbat he belonged to, a generation especially gifted and
brilliant, wbich. produced such statesmen as
Laurier and the wonderful leader of this

of many Canadian companies, and his outstanding commercial knowledge and talents
were of great value to Canadian enterprises
and institutions.
This Bouse, I arn sure, will desire to mark
the profound sense of loss which Parliament
and the Dominion of Canada have sustained
through the death of these honourable gentlemen.
To the bereaved families of these two great
Canadians we extend our profound sympathy.
"To live in hearts we leave hehind, is not to

MR. A. B. BLOUNT
FORMER CLERK 0F THE SENATE

Hou. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, we ail share in the regrets expressed by members of this Chamber at the
departure of our la>te colleagues, the Honourable Senators Brown and Casgrain. I
have to take note of the departure of one who
has been among us for over twenty years,
but whomn we hope to see again.
Mr. Austin Ernest Blount, as Clerk of the
Senate, served this Chamber and ahl its
members faithfully and well. Baving been
closely interested in the proced-ure and work
of thîs Chamber, I have been able to judge
of the value of the services which Mr. Blount
rendered. Very often, if not every day, 1 had
occasion to turn to him for information, and
I neyer saw a more zealous and devoted
officiai of Parliament. I arn quite sure that
what I state now can be repeated by ail the
members of this Chamber wbo have called
upon hima for information or advice.
I regret that Mr. Blount bas left us. Be
has done sa because of the regulations that
govern our personnel. I only hope that
occasionally he may stili be near at hand.
He has told me that if we should ever need
lis assistance, or if our new Clerk-whose
qualifications I recognize, and whom I welcome
here as a wortby successr-should ever need
bis advice, be will be glad to be of service.
Under these circumstances I feel that this
Chamber should continue what since 1867 bas
been the custom and tradition of this Bouse
when its Clerks bave left it under conditions
sucb as those govern.ing the departure of Mr.
Blount; and-witb my rigbt bonourable friend
as seconder I would move:
That in view of the long and faithful
services of Mr. Austin Ernest iBlount, C.M.G.,
former Cierk of the Senate, he be continued
an bonorary officer of this Bouse and be allowed
the entree of the Senate and a seat at the
Table on occasions of cerenlony.
Bon. Mr. DUFE: Carried.

Rigbt Bon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: There
wiIl be occasions when it will be quite easy
for the bonourable senator fromn Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif) to bead me off, but the
present one is tao important for that.
Wben I first came to Ottawa, more than
thirty years ago, Mr. A. E. Blount was
private secretary to the then Leader of the
Opposition in the House of Commons, R.
L. Borden. He continued in that office,
succeeding, in 1911, to the onerous position
of private secretary to the Prime Minister,
in which position be continued until he was
appointed Clerk of this Chamber, about
twenty-one years ago. I neyer knew a more
efficient private secretary. I neyer knew a
harder worker. Nor did I ever know a man
who could locate information more quicldy
than Mr. Blount could. Whilc be was Clerk
of this Bouse I had occasion to differ with
him two or three times on matters of rules,
and I found in each case that be was rigbt.
I do not tbink I could pay a bigher compliment to any official than that.
I believe the bonour now being tendered
Mr. Blount in the body of this motion was
conferred upon a Clerk of this Bouse of
former years, Mr. St. Onge Cbapleau, a quite
distinguished man, the story of whose liSe
is indeed a tbrilling one. I feel sure tbe
conferring of the same honour upon Mr.
Bînunt is well deserved and wiIi he appreciated hy him, and that tbere will be times
wben we shahl be glad to bave him bere, or
glad to consult bim though he be nlot here.
I also join with the honourable leader of
the Government in a word of welcome ta tbe
new Clerk of this Bouse, Mr. Moyer. Bim
too, I bave known for some cônsiderable time.
He bas gone through tha;t very agonizing
machine, the secretarysbip to a Prime Minister. He as well bas legal knowledge and
training, which will serve him in good stead
bere. 1 arn sure the appointment is wholly
sa'tisfactory to ahl on this sîde of the Bouse.
and I feel confident Mr. Moyer will have a
happy and useful life in bis present post.
The motion was agreed to.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to tbe consideration of Bis Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Bon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL rose
to move that an Address be presented to Bis
Excellency the Governor General to offer
the humble thanks of this Bouse to Bis

71498-2
REVISED EDITION

10

SENATE

Excellency for the gracious Speech which be
bas been pleased to make to both Houses of
Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, let me
begin by expressing my very high appreciation of the privilege of being a member of
this honourable body. I saw about me last
session and I see again now many men who
have bad a long and wide experience in
public affairs, as members of the House of
Commons and of legislative assemblies in
different parts of the Dominion of Canada.
After all, I am bound to say that there is
nothing so valuable to the man who seeks
to serve bis country in a deliberative assembly
as a knowledge of and experience in public
affairs. During the recess there have been
some changes in the leadership of different
parties in this country. Let me express my
satisfaction, which I think will be joined
in by every member of this House, that in
the Senate of Canada we have the same
two leaders continuing in their positions.
Both of them have had very long experience,
and by excellent training and industry they
have well equipped themselves for the discharge of their important duties.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The infliction of
my remarks upon you cannot bo charged
against me. I believe it is the custom in
this House that the person selected to move
the Address shall be the youngest in point of
membership, and so the task happens to fall
to my lot. As to my being a member of
this House, I believe that what happens to
a man in polities and public affairs is at least
fifty per cent due to accidents-sometimes
I bave thougbt it is seventy-five per cent.
So I was wondering just how it happens
that I am bere; but when I observed that
two other senators were born in the County
of Bruce-the honourable gentleman from
North Bruce (Hon. Mr. Spence) and the
honourable gentleman froin South Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Donnelly)-I concluded that my
presence here is due to my having had the
good fortune to be boni in the county that
bears the nane of Scotland's hero king.
I know that the whole of Canada is looking forward with great pleasure to the visit
to our country next summer of His Majesty
the King and Her Majesty the Qneen. No
visit of this kind bas been made before.
Other members of the Royal Family have
come to Canada and been given very warm
welcomes, but a visit from Their Majesties
themselves will be something quite different.
I think I am justified in saying that they
will be heartily and loyally welcomed by
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

virtually every citizen of this country. The
present King of Great Britain and ber
Dominions declared when he ascended the
Throne that it was going to be his determination to follow as far as possible in the footsteps of bis father, King George V. Every
member of this House bas a recollection of
the fact that King George V, by the manner
in which he conducted himself in the
occupancy of bis exalted position during the
troublous times of the War and in the period
of political crises following the War, made
the British Throne safe when most other
kings were tumbling off their thrones. We
always had a very great admiration for King
George V, not only as a sovereign but as
a man; and I am quite sure that as we
become better acquainted with his son, King
George VI, we shall find he is a worthy son
of a worthy sire.
So far as Her Majesty the Queen is
concerned, she is Scotland's gift to the British
Commonwealth of Nations.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I have no doubt
that ber delightful, charning graciousness will
win the heart of every Canadian when she is
in this country. I am sure that the arrangements in connection with the visit will be
carefully made, and I hope they will be such
as to permit the greatest possible number of
our people to see the King and Queen without
any over-tiring performances on the part of
Their Majesties.
I do not know that I should take up very
much of your time, honourable senators. but
I should be sorry to sit down without making
a few observations about one branch of
Canadian enterprise in which I have been
interested all my life, the business of farming.
I am going to try to discuss in just a few
minutes some of the things that are being
done, and some that perhaps may be donc,
to improve the condition of the men wbo are
growing crops and producing live stock in
Canada. We know that every country which
bas a surplus of farm products to-day is finding
great difficulty in disposing of them. All these
countries are not only looking around for
markets, but they are devising plans and
schemes by which agricultural production may
be curtailed, to save the markets from being
flooded. Farming is an industry that produces
food and clothing for all the people in the
world. Ever since we began farming in this
country we have produced more than we could
consume at home, and consequently outside
markets have been very important and valuable to us. Bad conditions in our agricultural
industry have generally arisen through lack of
outside markets.

JANUARY 17, 1939
There are some things that governments can
do with regard to these matters, and there are
some things that they cannot do, or rather
that they should not do. The dear knows,
they sometimes do them. My opinion is that
the future of farming depends largely upon
three things: the first is industry, the second
is intelligence, and the third is industry
repeated. I have a very distinct recollection
of farming as carried on in this Dominion for
fully sixty years, having taken part in it over
that period of time. My first occupation
required that I use a blue beech gad to drive
Buck and Berry while my father ploughed the
new furrow. There I learned some of the
methods of cultivation that should be used
in order to produce good crops. And I
observed that some people in the neighbourhood had good crops, while other people, with
equal opportunity, had comparatively poor
crops. There also I found out some of the
reasons why one five-acre field will produce
more oats than another.
Now, after a period of a little over sixty
years. I am again working that same farm;
and I am getting more enjoyment out of it
than, perhaps, I have ever got out of any
other occupation that I have engaged in up
to the present time. Breaking prairie cannot
be compared to going back to a farm which
you saw chopped out of a hardwood bush,
a farm where you waited eight years for the
stumps to rot, then uprooted them and burned
them, and after that engaged in the occupation
of getting the best that the soil could produce.
I am bound to say that during the past summer
it frequently occurred to me that if I did the
things that my father told me to do more than
a half-century ago, I should not go very far
wrong. After all, the best implement on a
farm is a plough, and the best plant is grass.
In grass, of course, I include the clover family.
If a man will judiciously apply his plough and
use grass on his land, no matter whether he
be farming in the province of Ontario or on
the Prairies, he will get on. The most
important product of farns in Ontario and
all over the Dominion is live stock, and
though I am not one who fails to appreciate
the importance and value of wheat, I hope to
see the day when the producing of cattle will
be the principal agricultural business of al]
our provinces.
In the past summer something was done
that surprised me and a great many men who
are in the farming business. The marketing of
live stock produced in the East and on the
Prairies has long been a serious problem with
us, but a new method of marketing our beef
on the greatest beef market of the world has
now been discovered. After al], we have only
two markets: one is Great Britain and the
71498-2j

other is the large cities of the United States
of America. Other countries with which we do
business are not beef eaters. It is true that
we may send a few thin cows to some places
where they are ground up into sausage, but our
real markets are in Great Britain and the
United States. Great Britain is the greatest
beef-eating country in the world. Not only
have the people there a good appetite for beef,
but they have a very discriminating one, and,
if you give them the kind of product they
want, they have no objection to paying a good
price.
For a long period of years we have experimented with different methods of shipping
cattle or beef to Great Britain. A few years
ago we gave up the idea of shipping beef, because we thought we could not compete with
the Argentine. But this year, as I say, we discovered a new way of shipping beef. Cattle
killed in the city of Toronto-and within a
few weeks this will also be true of cattle
killed in Winnipeg; and, a few weeks later,
of cattle killed in Edmonton and Calgary-is
shipped to the Smithfield market in London,
where it commands a higher price than prime
Scotch. And when you speak about anything
Scotch you necessarily speak about the highest
quality there is. Scotch short sides have sold
on the Smithfield market for a higher price
and for a longer period of time than any other
kind of beef. Yet we have been able to kill
beef in Toronto, ship it to the seaboard, load
it onto boats, unload it at Liverpool, and ship
it to Smithfield, then sell it for nearly half a
cent a pound more than Scotch beef was
bringing at that time.
This is a revelation, a most astonishing thing.
It surprised not only Canadians who are engaged in the actual production of beef, but
also a man who is, perhaps, the best authority
in Canada on the marketing of beef. I refer
to Mr. J. S. MeLean, of Canada Packers, who
bas had a wide and very important experience
in the marketing of meats of all kinds. He
said to me: "We have been trying for the last
ten years to discover a method of shipping
Canadian beef to the British market and getting a higher price for it, but none of us were
able to do it. It remained for Dr. A. M.
Shaw, the head of the Marketing Branch, appointed by the Minister of Agriculture for
Canada, to show us the way." As I say,
we are killing beef in Toronto and sending it
over to Great Britain, and it is the talk of the
Smithfield market. Now, what does that
mean to us?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
honourable gentleman goes on, will he tell us
what it is that has been discovered? I am
not disputing what he says, but I should like
to know what the new development is.

12

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Formerly the meat
shipped to Great Britain was laid on its side
in cars and chilled, because it was thought
that otherwise it could not arrive in good
condition. The packing plants were shipping
sides packed in railway cars, and these were
transferred from the cars to boats and taken
to Liverpool, then unloaded into vans and
shipped to Smithfield.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The beef was
chilled.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: We have developed
now the shipment of what is called baby beef.
The trade name for it is fed-calves, that is,
young animals that will produce a carcass
weighing around 400 to 500 pounds, and some
up to 550 pounds. Mr. MeLean said to me,
"It is a wonder that nobody thought before of
doing what we arc doing now." And what we
are doing is exactly what the Scotsman in
Aberdeen does. The cars being some seven
feet in height, we are able to hang up the
whole side, if it does not weigh over 400
pounds, and wben it is heavier than that we
cut off at the second rib and then bang the
short side up. Remember. nothing but prime
beef is shipped in this way. The result is that
the packing plants have no difficulty in disposing of it in England. The railways have
given their co-operation, by seeing that the
temperature in the cars never goes below 32
degrees. and scarcely even se low. So the
meat is not chilled to the extent that Argentine meat is. The time that the beef is in
the cooler, then in the car, then in the boat,
and finally in the van in the Old Country, is
about the sane time that it would take to
ripen the beef in the packing house at home;
and while being shipped in this way it ripens
at about the same temperature and to about
the same degree as if it were in the packing
heuse. We are now putting on the Smithfield
market a product they never saw from Canada
before, with the result that all shippers of
beef te the British market to-day are crowding around to see our product.
I have in my hand a letter from Mr.
Young, a veterinary surgeon on the Smithfield market. He bas been there forty years
inspecting beef shipped in by several countries. If you ship beef to the Smithfield
market you must employ a British veterinary
surgeon to give a certificate in connection
with it. Canada employed Mr. Young some
years ago at a small retainer. He inspects
beef for several other countries as well. Let
me read a few extracts from bis letter. He
says:
We have had on Smithfield Market this
week some of the world's best meat. The cousignments froin Argentine and Uruguay were.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I think, the most useful butchers' meeat that
has ever been sent to Snithfield Market, and
I speak from an experience of nearly forty
years.
This opinion vas supported by the
whole of the members of the trade, who have
had similar experience. These consignments
were shown on Monday, December 19, and the
consensus of opinion was that nothing better
could be produced.
The exposure of the Canadian consignment
on Wednesday, the 21st, made the whole trade,
and those associated with it, absolutely stare
with astonishment, and it is no exaggeration
to say that nothing better in the form of
young, quickly matured, cattle has ever been
shown on Smithfield Market. This expression
includes the type of animal produced, the quick
maturity to the finisbed stage, the dressing of
the carcasses, and the careful transportation.
Then Mr. Young gives the prices. Scottish short sides, top, sold at 6/2d per stone,
while Canadian short sides, top, sold at 6/4d.
If you reckon a penny to be two cents, the
relative figures per pound are 18j cents for
the Scottish and 19 cents for the Canadian
meat.
As Mr. McLean said to me, "If somebody
had told us a few years ago that we would
be doing this to-day, we could scarcely have
believed him." But this is being donc. It
has been done now for thirty-two weeks,
and again and again Canadian beef bas
topped the market.
This beef is carefully sclected. There are
only fifty sides, or twenty-five carcasses, sent
in a week. There is a tremendous demand
for the beef, and we could gradually work the
business up to one hundred, one hundred
and fifty, or cven two hundred carcasses a
week. But there is more than that to it.
Not only are we getting a high price on this
export beef, but there is now a keener
demand for the good young beef which is
sold for home consumption.
A further advantage accruing from this
export trade is that it encourages the breeding of better cattle. Everybody knows what
the grading of hogs bas done for the improvement of the breed. By producing a better
bacon hog we get more money for our bacon
to-day, because the trade is a discriminating
one. I am confident that nothing will have
a greater tendency to improve our breeding
of beef cattle in this Dominion than this
particular market of which I speak. Some
of tIis export beef cattle is only eight months
old. Those who know anything about feeding cattle know that the more rapidly you
can get them ready to sell as good beef, the
better for the feeder, because then they are
net wasting either their time or yours.
This export trade will not only stimulate
the better breeding of cattle, it will also
stimulate the sale of weaned calves in the

JANUARY 17, 1939
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. There
are more good, high-class beef cattie bred in
Alberta and Saskatchewan than in the province
of Ontario, because, ranchers out there have
recognized the value of good breeding-sornething that we cannot alwajis get our fariners
to recognize. A bunch of these weaned calves
came down frorn Saskatchewan last fali and
were included in somne of the shipment ta
Great Britain and brought a very bigb price.
This ia new business developed this year, if
you please, when we thought we knew ail there
was ta know about shipping beef. It is going
to stimulate a new industry ini beef production both east and west. The Department
of Agriculture intend shipping frorn Winnipeg,
and then froin Calgary and Edmonton.
The officiais tell me that it is easier ta
ship this beef in the summer time than in
the winter, because you can maintain an even
temperature in the car much more easily in
summer than in winter, when the outside
-temperature varies so much. We are paying
freiglit only ou the beef, short aides of the
highest quality, and leaving the hide and
offal at home to pay for the alaughtering and
dressing of the animal. In a word, we are
sending our good beef ta the greateat mnarket
in the world at the lowest possible expense.
We have been able for the firat time, in
history, flot only to crash the British beef
market, but to crash it at the very top price.
As I 'have aaid, I know of nothing that will
be more important ta the man who is feeding
calves in the province of Ontario or to ranchers
who. are raîsing calves in Western Canada
than. this British market.
I may be, perhaps, a bit more enthusiastie
about these thinga than people who are not
so much coneerned. I visit the stockyards
every Monday morning when 1 arn in Toronto.
1 go out the-re ta sec the beasta. Somehow
or other, I rather like their companionship.
and I like to see the kind of stuif coming
.iu from different parts of the country. Sometimes it is almýost enough to inake you weep
to see rubbish. going into the abattoir -to be
sold as beef.
I think this new development wilI improve
the class and character of the beef cattie
we are going to breed in our country. It
is a great and important move, and it is subjected to the cloaest kind of inspection. That
is essential, for if you are ta get a ahare of a
top market you inust have a good article to
sel]. They are keen buyers in England, and
àf you have the kind of gooda they want they
will pay the price.
This business is going to affect the Royal
Winter Fair. I went to an abattoir to sec
carcasses of cattie slaughtered after the fair,

13

and I found, as usual, that we have a good
deal to learn, flot only, about feeding our
beef, but alo about being able ta tell what
is under their bides by bôndllng them. We
learned some lessons in that regard this year.
Remember thia: if you aend ta, the Smitbfield
market beef with yellow fat, you will not top
any market. It must be a white carcass and
flot too full of tallow if it is ta, grade as
prime beef. We find in some cases at the
Royal Winter Fair that animais are overfinished. Frequently when a judge puta hi.
banda on a beaat he will aay, "He would be
ail right if fed a few mre months." That
was aaid of two or three calves at Toronto,
but wben they were slaughtered tbey were
the beat carcasses of the lot.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.: la there any
chance of Prince Edward Island getting iuto
this Utopia?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Abaolutely-if you
will breed beef cattie. I understand you are
breeding more dairy cattie than beef. I will
corne to that later, if I ar nfot taking up too
much tisue.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: One of the judges
at the Royal Winter Fair this year was
Mr. MacDonald, who, by the way, comes froin
the University of California via Aberdeen,
Scotland. When he began judging he said
he was going ta place ri'bbons, flot on over-fat
animais, but on those wbich would be the
most profitable ta kili. 1 am quite sure he did
one of the 'beat jobs that have been done at
the fair, but there was a lot of disappointinenta
as well. We vote large grants annually to
that fair, and quite properly sa. Through this
experiment we shahl have a chance ta make
top prices on aur calves killed after the show.
We can make the Royal Winter Fair a greater
and more important institution for the judging
of beef cattie than it ever was before, by these
experiences in slaughtering and sbipping.
I shouid like ta sec our boys of the agricultural colleges visit the abattoirs even oftener
than they do, ta sec the beef carcasses and
sa get a better understanding of what they
should do with cattie in order ta secure top
prices.
There is, of course, fia politîca in this great
enterprise, for there cannot be in a thing of
this kind.
My honourable -friend from Prince (Hon.
Mr. MacArthur) asked me wbat about Prince
Edward Island; sa I will say a word or two
about cows, as I understand the people on the
Island breed mastly dairy cattie. During the
last year there have been experimental sbipments of dairy cows ta Great Britaîn. Tbe

SENATE
Goveroment inspects ail these cattie. Such
inspection is work a Government department
can do well. Ten Holstein cows have been
seat over to Mr. F. W. Gilbert, past president
of the British Friesian Association of Great
Britain. The vice-president, Mr. I. J. Yarmay,
has twclve cows and a bull that were selected
for his herd. The British breed associations
will not register these cattie now, as, like other
organizations, they want a lot of things done
their own way. But that (loes not matter s0
much in a country like England or Scotland,
where, after al], people breed and feed and
prepare their cattle for their own market.
They export only a few of the very best cattle
for breeding purposes. They are more concerned about the commercial resuits they
produce. Some of these cows soid as higlh as
£40 apiece, whichi is quite a decont price.
Under the regulations, after four crosses they
can be entered in the British Friesian herd
book. There is a tremendous potential market
there, because Canadian cattie are sound and
healthy. That is why our stock are wanted.
In an old country like Great Britain nobody
knows just how prevalent tuberculosis and
Bang's disease are, and the people there are
now preparing for a general testing of ail their
herds. What will bappen remains to be seen.
1 happencd to be present as a representative of the Dominion Department of Agriculture when the conditions for the removal
of the embargo against Canadian cattie were
embodied in the Biil which passed the British
House of Commons. When the question
of health came up, I immediately agreed that
ail cattie shipped to Great Britain for breeding purposes should pass the tests for tubercuiosis and Bang's disease. The British representatives were surprised, as cattie were cornin-g in from Ireland without any test at ail.
I said, "We do not want to ship unsound
breeding cattie to you, because ini four or
five years it would completeiy destroy our
market." Nobody has any business these days .
to, seli unsound breeding cattle cither in bis
own or in another country. Cattle have been
carefully tested by both the present and the
past gox ernments, ani as a resuit we have
establisbed in Great Britain a demand for
sound dairy cattle-a demand that we can
scarcely supply. Dairymen in Great Britain
tell me that about three years, three lactation periods. is the average life of a cow.
Many dainies fill a stable with cows to milk,
and when the cows begin to, drop off in their
miik they change to, heavier feed and prepare thern for the abattoir. Then they buy
up a new herd. That seems to us a wvasteCl system, but it cannot be or they would
nlot contirue it. That is the practice in some
Hon. Mir. MARSHALL.

dairies in Great Britain at the present time.
We have multiplied the number of cows
shipped there hy, I think, three or four. There
is not a large number going over yet, but
the very fact that our cows sdil at auction
at high prices is significant. One man in
C2heshire came over this year and took away
367 cows-a pretty good customner. When I
tell you that in that one county in England
they milk 100,000 cows, you will have some
idea of the potential demand.
These, I think, are the enterprises that
governments can and should support for the
improvement of marketing conditions for the
men who will produce good animais. Most
of the cows that seil for high prices in Great
Britain have a miik and butterfat record.
A few years ago I paid a visit to Mr. Alex.
Batchielor's farmn near Dundee, and le told
me that one of bis difficuities was that bis
Canadian cows were low testers. H1e had
over one hundred of them. Now when the
records both for butter-fat and for milk production go with cows to the British market,
and they are sold tbere on their merits, they
will bring high prices. If you wili seli a cow
on its merits, and you have a high--class
animal, the British market is always a good
one.
I notice that this year we have an inereased production of creamery butter. In
the eleven months of 1938 we produced almost
as mmcl creamery butter as during the wbole
of 1937. But there is a reduction in cheese
production of from twelve to fifteen million
pounds between this year and last. As a
resuit we have a low price for butter to-day.
Our butter does not seli as weli on the British
market as does our cleese. Wly? Because
ail our cheese sent to the British market is
graded, and when a grocer wants to buy
cheese le can telephone to Tooley street
for Canadian cheese, whicl bas our Government grade stamped on it. With some of
our Canadian butter he does flot feel quite
so safe. So Canadian butter, because of lack
of grade, does not occupy the same position
as our clieose on the British market.
I had the picasure of introducing legislation
for thc compulsory grading of cream into and
butter out of ereameries in the proviue'- of
Alber'ta. I also had the pleasure of introducing similar legislation in thc provimue of
Ontario when Minister of Agriculture. But
it is rather remarkable to recail that I
intro(luced thc Alberta Act just exactly
'twenty-fivc years before taking similar action
mn Ontario.
It must le borne in mi.d howccci, that it wouid bave been scarceiy possible
to procure sucli legislation in Ontario at a

JANUARY 17, 1939
much earlier date. Why? Because in AIberta we were at 'the beginning of the
creamery industry. In fact, very few cows
were milked in that province then, as most
of them could only be milked by a man an
harseback. There were only a few creameries
in aperation, and so we put in proper regulations at the very start. I recollect as a lad in
Ontario taking a firkin of butter ta the local
store and trading it for goods which we
needed. The grocer placed it behind the
counter with other butter and mixed it al
together. It was then renovated and perhaps
deodorjzed and sent ta the British market as
Canadian butter. Naturally this gave aur
butter a bad name on that market. I remember that the province of Alberta first
passed a grading law, Saskatchewan follawed
one or two years later, and Manitoba later
still. The three Prairie Provinces could then
seli their butter in Great Britaîn for two
cents a pound more than the commodity
commonly called Canadian butter brought.
AIl this goes ta show 'that if you are ta get
the best market you must have a standard
grade for yaur product. The purchaser must
knaw from the mark on the outside of the
box what quality lie is getting.
Sucli are the things that the Government
can do for people on the farms, and so enable
t'hem ta get tlie best passible return-and
they need it badly enough-for the hard
work they put in on the land.
I do not intend to say very mucli about
wheat, as probably the matter wîll be discussed. during the course of the session. I do
want, however, for a moment ta direct attention ta the value of Canadian wheat praduction and wheat expert. If our men on the
land in the Prairie Provinces will take care
of the structure of their soul and see that sucli
things are done ta it as will prevent their
farms fromn blowing over onto their neiglibaur's, then we shahl have a betýter systemn of
farming over the whole Dominion. Thase
who have been on the land in Western Canada
have faced great difficulties. After one experiences three or four years of drouglit one
does nat know quite what ta do. Many a time
I have watched for signs of rain Wlien a
man lias ta face difficulties of that kind, I
amn afraid lie daes not worry s0 mucli about
what lie should or should not do with lis land.
It seems ta me the great need in this country is a decent price for the men milking
cows and feeding cattle and carrying an aur
farrns; which, after aIl, should be carried on
in the family fashion all aver Canada. Farming then becomes nat merely an industry, but
an.institution, and our people begin ta understand the land as it is understood by the

farmers in England and Scotland. This is
perhaps best described by Tennyson in bis
Northern Farmer. When the old man was
dying, a bit early, lie thouglit, he very mucli
regretted having ta go, not on accaunlt af
his family or the neiglibaurs or anytbing of
that kind, but of the land. Whule lie had
done some things not quite up ta the mark,
yet he lioped ta be excused because lie had
been faithful ta the land. H1e thought some
other persan miglit be more easily spared; se
he said:
A mowt 'a taaen owd Joanes, as 'ant nat
a 'aapotli o' sense,
Or a rnowt 'a taaen young Robins-a niver
mended a fence;
But godamoighty a rnoost taake mea an'
taake ma now
Wi' aaf the cows ta cauve an' Thurnaby
lioahms ta plow.
When aur people have that kind of higli regard for the land on which they live, then we
shall have in this country the kind of farming
that will make for general success.
There are a few other things I should
like ta talk about, but I arn not gaing ta do
sa, because perhaps you kn:ow most af them
better tban I do. But I do hope the Senate
Committee an Agriculture will function. I do
not know who is chairman of tbat cornmittee;

great deal of useful service. 0f caurse in
saying that, I suppose I arn only daing what
every new member daes when lie comnes inte

of years during which I have met many people
of many kinds I have Iearned patience, and
I will not lie unduly pressing, although there
are some thýings that I shauld like te sec
done ta make life easier for the people -on
the farms.
During the last year I bave had the satisfaction, and it was a grim satisfaction, 'of
keeping track of aIl I had -ta spend on, and
ail I managed ta make fram the operation of
150 acres of land in the county of Bruce in

truths they ought ta know.

SENATE

The men who settled the ceunty of Bruce,
in fact the whole province of Ontario, were,
like my father, immigrants, mostly from,
England, Ireland and Scotland, with no money,
but with a dcsire to have a piece of land
that belonged to them. If I were offering
any advice to the farmers of this or an.y
other province, it would be to live without
the things for which they cannot pay, because
nobody ean. se ill afford to get into debt as a
farmer. I know of farms in Ontario that
have been occupicd by the samne family for
five generations.
Those farms bave neyer
been sold; thcy always have been inherited
by one son. There neyer was a mortgage
on them. There are more farms of that kind
in Ontario than one wou]d believe unless one
had the temerity, as I have had, te, talk to
these farmers and ask thcmn impudent questions. I should like to sec something done
to improve the condition of ýour farming
people-not to enable themn to operate two
automobiles or to have what some people
wrongfully call the luxury of the cities. Wading around the barnyard knee-deep in snow
in high rubber boots gives a great dcai more
satisfaction to people who care for the land
than the cnjoymcnt of what some people cal!
the "pleasures" of life. In Western Canada
there are many people from Central Europe
who are vcry similar to the British immigrants
I have mcntioncd. They are people whose
roots are in the soul. Ail the members of
the family will flot become farmers; some
will go into business or into the professions;,
but always there wiIl be one-oftcn the most
intelligent member of the family-who will
stay on the land. Others will go away, as
I did. But somcthing should be donc foi'
those who remain. I think this dcvelopmcnt
in the market for beef and dairv cattie is
important, because this country is inhabited
by people similar te those of the British
Isles, who for many generations have farmed
succcssfully; people wbo have inlivritcd the
desire to tiIl, and the inclination to own
land and to hand it on te, their successors
unimpaired. They belong to the land.

Hon. JULES PREVOST (Translation): As I
risc to second the address in reply to the
Speech fromi the Throne, which bas just bcen
presentcd in s0 original a manner hiz cur colleagîie the honojîrable senator fromi Peel (Hon.
lion. ".\r.MARSHALL.

Mr. Marshall), I feel quite unwortby of the
task ahead of mie. I therefore beg of ynu to
bcar patiently with me while I make a few
remarks.
The speech by whicb lis Excellency the
Governor Gencral opened this session is distinguisbed by an exceptional feature. Indced
this speech will remain as a landmark in our
parliamentary records, for it announces an
event wbich will mark an cpoch in our bistory:
the forthicoming visit to Canada of Their
Maj caties the King and Qucen of Great
Britain. The Canadian people are rejoicing
over this prospect, because the expansion of
our liberty and autcnemy bas been accompanied by an ever increasing attachmcnt to
the Sovercign, who is for us a living symbol
cf the British institutions whichi have shcltered
the dcvelopmcnt cf our nation.
The Speech froim the Tbronc mentions
numerous and grave questions and ia a proof
cf the importance acquired by Canadian politics, and of the sericusncas cf problems Canada
must face, from. the econemie as well as from
the national and international standpoints,
problema which the Governýmcnt labours to
solve in the free exercîse cf its righits, the full
censcieusncss cf its duties and responsihilities.
It is possible that opinions may differ on
questions cf detail, but I helieve I may say
positivcly that we are aIl unitcd on the
principles at stake in the different questions
mentioncd in the Speech from the Thronc.
Whether if he a rnat.ter for examplc, cf finding
more and wider outlets for cur commerce,
an objeet which our trade agreements with
Great Britain and the United States would
realize, as well as those in course cf preparatien with the West Indies and other couintries,
or wvhether it be the painful prohlem cf unemployment, whicb the Covcrnment is trying te
rclieve. or the rouinding off cf our national
defences; in ail cases, Canadians admit that
efforts and provision are imperative if we are
te masure gencral wvelfare and sccurity.
I de net wish te discuss aIl the subjecta cf
this sessienal pregram, but sheuld like te
cmphasizc two in particular, and shaîl de se
bricfly.
Here is what His Excellency the Governor
Gencral bas te say about uneiployineat:
Unempîcyment in Canada continues te reccive
the unrcmitting attention cf local, provincial
and federal autherities. Having regard te the
existing division of poers and obligations
un(lcr the iBritish North America Act, respensibility for unempîclyrnent an(l the solution cf
its problemas is necessarily clivided. There bas
been an. inreasi.ng assuinption cf obligations
on the part of the Federal Government.
The Speech from the Tbrone recalîs that the
Federal Govcrnment stimulated the building industry and empîcyment in private in-

JANUARY 17, 1939
dustry; to this end, it lent considerable sums
of money to private individuals, societies and
municipalities; it made special grants te the
mining industry and to the youthful unemployed; it allowed the provinces generous
subsidies towards relieving -the victirna of unemployment; it undertook a vast prograux
of public works and came ta the assistance
of the provinces in the matter of road building, colonization and undertakings likely to
promote employment on farina and in forest
protection work.
The present division of constitutional
powers is an obstacle ta other measures which
would hasten a final solution of the problem.
"My Ministers," says His Excellency,
"recognize that the plight of those who are
still unemployed cannat await necessary conTherefore, the
stitutional amendments."
speech forecasts:
It is proposed further to expand the Government's long-range profgram of public undertakings. In pursuance of the policy of the active
encouragement of employment, it is also proposed to undertake, with provincial ca-apera-

tion, ta provide assistance to municipalities
which, as an alternative to the provision of
direct relief, desire to expand their normal
programs of civic improvements.
Here is a decision which, I believe, will be
received with general approval.
Work-relief is a necessity. We must indeed guard against the passibility af breeding
a generation of unemployed unused ta wark.
Let us coniess that, owing to the ecanamic
disturbances which have prevailed in the
last few years, the State, for too long already,
has fumbled, beaten about the bush, and
experimented with different modes af relief.
In the case of the unemployed, the sale use
af direct, relief would jeopardize the resaurces
ai the nation while iailing ta decrease the
hardships af those who wish ta earn their daily
bread honourably and by the sweat af their
brow, withaut recaurse ta the charitable
agencies.
When warkingmen of all trades find themselves in such a painful situation, it is the
duty ai the State ta undertake a vast program
of public works. When I speak ai the State
1 mean the Federal Goverument, then the
provincial and municipal governments. The
three governing bodies eau and must came ta
some form of agreement in order ta promate
works, whether necessary or simply useful. 0f
course, the contribution of the State ta public
works costs more than the so-called "direct
relief to the unemployed." But is it nlot preferable to spend two millions on useful, permanent
projects which will still be a benefit to the
country when the depression is past, and will
save the unemployed irom deadly idleness,

17

rather than one million ta ieed men who are
vainly seeking work and must soon become
loafers? It is nat easy ta draw up a program
ai great national works. However, 1 persist
in believing that is the task ta which aur statesmen must address themselves. We must resolutely set aur faces towards reality and stop
devoting millions each year ta keep men in
idleness.
The unemployed who are healthy and whose
hearts are in the right place demand work.
When the workingman puts out bis band, bie is
asking nat for almas, but for the salary due ta
his labour.
I repeat, with many others, relief thraugh
work is imperative if we wish nat only ta
maintain life among aur unemployed and their
families, but ta rebuild the morale ai aur
people as well.
The international situation and the defence
of Canada also occupy an important place in
the Speech from the Throne. His Excellency
says:
My Ministers have fouud it neoessary ta give
auxiaus and continuous consideration ta developments in the international situation and
their effects upon Canada. Our own relations
with other cauntries continue friendly, but the
aggressive policies actively pursued in other
continents have inevitably had a disturbing
effect upon every part ai the warld.
The Goverument shared in the general sense
ai relief that the appalling disaster of war,
which threatened Europe during the month ai
September last, was averted, and in the recognition which that crisis manifested ai the widespread will af the peoples for peace. They
are hopeful that the efforts now being made to
fiud a solution for the specifie differences which
are causing friction will meet with success.
They recognize, nevertheless, that time is required for these farces to work, and that the
possibility ai further tension in the meantime
must be faced. Iu this situation, the Government have considered that the uncertainties
of the futue and the conditions ai modern
wafrmale it imperative that Canada's
defences be materially strengthened.
That is no more than Canada's duty. Any
thinking Canadian should have sufficient
vision and national pride ta understand that
we must organize aur defences in an orderly

and worthy tuanner. Our title, or rather aur
cf atus as an autanomous nation, does not imply
that we have rights only; it means that we
have duties also. Among aur duties we must
surely number the obligation ta pursue the
modernization of aur defences and the efficient
protection ai aur shores.
In ail good iaitb, is it not beyond doubt
that the organizatian ai the defence ai Canada is a necessity and a duty? Such was
always the attitude and the coàvictian ai al
aur political leaders, of ail aur statesmen. ai

18

SENATE

Macdonald, Galt, Cartier, Tupper, Brown,
Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Chapleau, Laurier and
their successors.
Canada is a nation whose autonomy is today more nearly complete than yesterday, and
will to-mïorrow be perfect and final. Those
who cast doubt on the status we claim as a
nation cannot, at all events, deny that our
vast and wealthy country should aim to win
that fine title, that our destiny demands that
we should make ready for the part expected
of us, that our Canadians are too virile, too
energetic, to limit their aspirations and disregard their obligations.
The appropriations required for national
defence are nothing new. Their increase is
explained and justified. All qualified men
of good understanding are unanimous in their
praise of what has already been accomplished,
but we still have to speed up the reorganization of our national defence.
Our people are but imperfectly informed
on the subject. Enjoying perfect calm and
a peaceful existence, Canadians do not sufficiently understand their obligation towards
national defence, an obligation common to all
nations who would live and expand. We
must all agree with Cartier:
"A people
cannot aspire to the status of a nation unless
it has military elements and the means of
defending itself." The obligation to defend
the nation has a special claim on the attention of those at the head of affairs, since the
science of government demands foresight. Our
statesmen foresaw this national duty. It is
imperative that the people should see it in
its truc light. We must therefore undertake
popular education on that point.
I believe the fear of British imperialism still
exists in certain circles, blurring the perception
of some things. Like the majority of Canadians, I am, and have always been, opposed
to military imperialism. But I should not like
to see the opposition to imperialism smother
all other sentiments in Canada, nor make of
us such fanaties that doubt and suspicion could
take root among us and breathe into us a fear
of living which might arrest our progress
towards full enjoyment of our national status,
leaving us rooted to the spot through our fear
of British imperialism.
As Canadians, we must bc clear-sighted
enough to perceive the obligations imposed
by- the future; we should be strong enough
to accept those obligations fearlessly.
Do we not know that the times are past
when the waters of the sea parted to swallow
up the enemies of a nation guided through
the night by a pillar of liglht and ceaselessly
protected through the miraculous intervention
Hon. Mr. PREVOST.

of Jehovah? Rather does the God of Battles
say to-day: " Heaven helps those who help
themselves."
Our ancestors who fought with all their
might, who even shed their blood in their
battle foc the liberties we enjoy to-day, meant
to establish here a great and true nation.
Let us reread our history, let us study our
constitution, let us listen again to all the statesmen vho succeeded one another in the course
of the last century, let us recall the different
stages of our prodigious and speedy progress,
and we shall conclude that the blossoming of
our national life, with its new obligations,
is only the continuation of the work set in
motion by the fathers of our country.
If the Speech from the Throne is read with
deep attention it is easily seen that it
expresses anxiety regarding the fundamental
forces of the country. Of course, the sessional
program it reflects is concerned with financial
and economic problems, but these result from
the development of the spiritual force in the
Canadian soul.
To apprehend its full force and consequences,
it is necessary to read the speech from the
national viewpoint, with a national pride, and
the two together dictate our national duties.
In that spirit, Canada, to-day as in the past,
intends to remain a British country, although
fully conscious of all its liberties and all its
responsibilities as a Canadian nation. Thus,
Canada in its foreign policy bas friendship
for all, malice towards none, and in its
domestic policy it pursues the development of
the country and the prosperity of all Canadians in unity, order, moderation, peace and
security.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, the debate on the Address in
this House is never very lengthy. Indeed,
here we do not seek to emphasize the importance of debates so much as the usefulness
of other work that we try to do. An opportunity does come, though, in the motion for
thanks to His Excellency for his Speech, to
review the condition of the country, and particularly to measure the degree with which
the Government bas met the realities of that
condition; and as well, perhaps, to offer some
observations on what improvements might be
made.
First of all, I congratulate the mover of
the Address (Hon. Mr. Marshall) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Prévost) on the speeches
they have made to-day. I listened with
much interest to the speech of the honourable senator fron Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall).
I say to him that while his remarks had no
relation whatever to any of the subject-matter
of the Speech from the Throne, they covered
a subject vastly more important than anything

JANUARY 17, 1939
touched on, in that speech. I feel as if I had
been neglected in not having received any of
the information which the honourable gentleman has, regarding the new method of shipping Canadian cattle to Great Britain. That
farm product is of vast importance to us all,
and I say without qualification of any kind
that if the new method is as successful as the
honourable member deems it to be-and in
this respect he quotes very high authoritythen what he says is the most cheerful message
for the farmers of this Dominion that I have
heard in many a long day. I recall that years
ago the same gentleman to whom the honourable senator made reference had hopes that
there might be developed some method of
chilling which would make possible the successful shipment of beef from Canada to Great
Britain. Well do I remember with what
pessimism the suggestion was received by
another high authority in this Chamber, the
honourable senator from Marquette (Hon. Mr.
Mullins). So far the honourable senator from
Marquette has been right. This new method,
as I understand it, has not to do with what is
usually known as the chilling process, but is
some modificàtion, which so far has proved
successful, of the shipping process.
The outlook is not bright. I think it is well
that a Government to which the honourable
member is friendly was in office when he made
his speech. Had it not been, I can imagine
the changes he would ring, and I can imagine
also where he would place the blame. I know
what the honourable gentleman would say
was all wrong, and the reasons he would give
for the depression in agriculture. But now
those reasons cannot be given, and he sets
out in businesslike fashion to make some common-sense suggestions as to what can be done.
The wheat outiook is not good. Indeed, it
is so far from being good that governments,
not only in our own Dominion but in all the
wheat growing and exporting countries of the
world, are exercising their wits to the limit
in an effort to think out some plan that will
save the price situation over the next three
or four years.
We have not made the success which we
should have made of our hog production.
I presume our failure is largely due to the
drought in the West and the killings which
became essential there. However, it is a
disaster to the country, because the conversion
of grains into bacon, where the bacon market
is so ample as it is to-day and has been for
some years-a market which we have not yet
more than half filled-is certainly a much
more businesslike process of disposing of our
grains than any that has been suggested at
those conferences of which mention has been
made.

19

If the outlook for agriculture is not good,
there is some reason. The reason is a universal
one. There is no way of artificially raising
the level of the standard of living for agriculturists. There is a way of artificially raising
that level for other people: for labour, for
example, through the union, and for people in
other lines of production through the cartel.
But these things cannot be made to work in
an -agricultural community. While the farmer
thinks that some fiscal system is bearing down
upon him and making him pay unduly for the
products he has to buy, what is really bearing
down upon him is the weight of a social
system where others can raise their standards
at his cost; for it is at the cost of the primary
producer always that standards are artificialjy
lifted.
I heard the Speech from the Throne, and I
have read it. It is of extraordinary length.
It has no other extraordinary feature. Speeches
from the Throne have become pretty much
electioneering pamphlets. They become more
and more campaign literature as the campaign approaches; and this Speech from the
Throne reads to me very much like a prolonged and painful effort of the Government
to convince the country that the Government
has a very high opinion of itself. Look at
paragraph one, paragraph six, paragraph eight;
note the subjects touched on and the skill
of the hand that makes about each subject
the assertion without any particular meaning, and the promise with nothing specific;
then look back on other speeches, and you can
see pretty well what has happened in the
intervening time.
This speech, for example, says nothing at
all about the trade of Canada. One would
think we were not a trading country at all;
the subject is never mentioned. But, of course,
any intelligent person knows the reason why:
trade has been going down; and things that
do not read well for campaign purposes do
not appear in speeches from the Throne. Our
trade in the year past has diminished by some
$200,000,000 in exports and, I think, about
$90,000,000 in imports. There is no reason
given for this decline. Of course, we know
the reason: the trade of the world is pretty
much contracted. But the subject escaped
the notice of the draftsman of the Speech
from the Throne.
He mentioned nothing at all about our
revenues, although from time immemorial, if
there was anything cheerful to mention, it
always appeared in the Speech from the
Throne. The reason for the omission, naturally, is that our revenues have been going
down. They are less for the past year than

20

SENATE

the year before, even though taxation of business concerns--which are the employers of
lahour-was about 822,300,000 more. But
though the total revenue was less, the expenditure managed to maintain the samne
robust virility with which it has progressed
threugh ail the decades: it was more than the
year before.
And the speech omits altogether the Canadian National Railways. That distinguished
entity does flot appear on the pages of the
speech at ail-on any of the first five pages
anyway. Well, one does not have to look far
to know why that subi ect is entirely forgotten. It is because the Canadian National
Railways have had one of the saddest years
of their history. Without doubt, the deficit
is going to be 811,000,000 more than it was
last year. I ask the honourable leader of
the Government to watch now and see if it
is not a couple of million worse than that,
although it is only a few short months since
we listened to some of their leading officers
explain why the first three months' operating
results were worse than their rival's and
prophesy that an improvement would he
made in the last nine months. The returns
for the last fine month were worse than
these for the flrst three. And wvhereas the
Canadian Pacifie net operating revenue is
reduced fromn the year before by about S3,900,000, the Canadian National Railways' is reduced by about $11,800,000-almost four times
the net reduction of the Canadian Pacific. Such
is the story that is te be told this year, a story
omitted entirely frem the Speech from the
Throne.
There is a euphonious reference te the laudable ambition of the Government to help the
farmer and to the purchase of Western wheat,
but the draftsman dees not bother to attempt
any estimate of what the loss will be. On
present markets the loss ivould arneunt to
something in the neighhourhood of $60,000,000.
If it does-no one can say whether it will or
net; it may be more-if it does, we shall have
no very great difflculty in calculating just how
much further we are down the long, endless
hilI than we were a year ago.

Let us stop to inquire where al this is taking us, and what is te he the end ef it. I
think I understand the end. The Speech from
the Throne has several paragraphs referring- te
unemployment. It tells ail about the yeuth
training mevement. Ilonourable members will
recaîl the statutes of about three years ago by
which provision was made specially te look
after young mon and women, and in fact every-

body elso who had a voe.

siderable boastings ]ately of what bas been

movement. It is referred te even in this
Speech from tbe Tbrone. The speech does net
say unemployment is decreasing; it says there

are fewer in receipt of government assistance
than there were two years ago. 0f course there
are. One year ago we had somewhat better
crops in the West, and therefore the need of
those on relief in these farming communities
is mucb less. But for the workers of our
country the situation is virtually the same as
wben this Government came into office. The
relief bis for the worker are substantially wbat
they bave been ail along. I doubt whether
tbey are net higber; that is te say, in the
number of those te whom they are applied.
You cannot go through the Dominion and find
anyone who wîll tell you that the employment
situation is getting better. Ail the hopes and
prophecies of the Government have gone for
nothing.
For years I have been trying te drive
into the brains of members of the Administration, of members of the Huse of Coinmens, and especially of the people of the
country, the enly way we can assist unemployment and strengthen our public finances.

There is ne way of taking care of unemployment in a free country except the multiplication of industry and the consequent increase
of employment. Unemployment can be taken
cars of in another way in Germany, in Italy,
or in Russia; and it is. If the people are
regimented, placed where they are told te go,
put into the army here and into munition
plants there, directed by the Administration,
the unemployment prohlemn can bcecurod;
wages and work can ho got for ail. But work
cannot be got for ail on the union scalo. Wages
are net paid then on any basis dictated by the
power of labour. The freedom of the subject
is gene. The price paid for the romoval of
unemployment
is a high price-a prie
which we ail hope and pray will noever be
exacted from people of the Anglo-Saxon race.
But if we are net 'willing te suhmit te straitjacketing, then we can cure this problein
in one way, and one only: by turning on
the green light -te industry, by enabling and
encouraging people te got into this or that
line of enterprîse-hy providing outiets for
courage and for industry. These are found
always if conditions are such that people
who emhark on any enterprise cao make it go,
and will net be hounded down by taxation
once they start. There is plenty of inoney
in the country new. When the country puts
out a boan it is over-suhscribed.
Two or
threc days ago w'e had a boan subscrihed
several times ever. Why is the money on
hand? Because people are afraid te lot money
go elsewhere. It is tho samne across the lino.

JANUARY 17, 1939
Let us flot imagine, as the draftsman of
this speech, the Prime Minîister of this
country, appears to, that the Government
tbemseives by lending money ta a municipality
to build a town hall, or by helping a bank
to lend money ta somebody to imprave his
house, -or by itself building some stately
structure in somne city, or by lending money
to build terminal facilities somewbere, are
ever going to cure unemployment. Snch expedients may produce a temporary effeet. You
bave only to look across ta the south to
appreciate the resuits. In the last five or
six years tbe Gaverument of tbe United States
bave spent twenty-five tbousand million dollars
that very way in an effort to reduce unemployment. Where are tbey to-day? Will any
bonouýrable member answeïr tbe question?
Have tbey moved tbe length of their own
legs to solve the unemployment problem
af the United States? I do flot tbink tbey
bave gone as far towards a solution as we
bave witb aur problem-and we bave not
moved at ail.
Put out to-morrow anotber boan of the
Dominion of Canada or tbe province of Ontario: it will be over-subscribed toa. Tbe rate
of interest will go down. The American
Government are even borrowing at less than
notbing. In tbe United States men are snbscribing over $100 for boans of $100 with fia
interest at ail, because in tbat way tbey save
taxes on deposits. The American Government are taxing bere and taxing -there, increasing this tax and tbat, until the burden
of taxation bas berome so beavy tbat people
are trying to get tbeir mnoney into some place
wbere it wiil not be stolen. Are we not
doing mu-eb the same, tbougb in a lesser
degree? Tbe outcome will be tbat anybady
wbo bas anytbiag wili bave it in Government bonds that are wortbless, or in Government money that also is wortbless. We are
bound to reacb sucb a situation, and there
is no atber place we can reacb, unless we
turn around. Our bonds cannot be any good
unless industry can operate to pay the interest
on tbem. We must bring our expenditure
below our income. Conditions must be sncb
that a man of enterprise and courage cati see
sometbing abead. Until you bring about sucb
conditions y_.u will neyer cure unemployment;
the same story will be repeated year after
year. Since co.ming into power y-ou bave flot
advanced an inch nea-rer tbe solution, and at
tbe present rate yon will neyer solve the
problem.
Wben, at the opening of the Hanse ta-day,
tbe leader of tbe Government read a statement to the effeet that the Government of

Canada neyer i'nterfered with the independence
of tbe Broadcasting Corporation, the thougbt
occurred to me: would that tbait principle
appiied to the Board of tbe Canadian National
Railways! I say tbis because I bear on every
side that the Government are, in effect, going
ta direct tbat board to start new ýterminais
in Montreai at a cost of millions. Did not
a minister af tbe Crown, did not two ministers of tbe Crown, in a recent by-election
in that city promise the ele«ctors af St. Henri
tbat the new terminaIs would be built by the
Government, or under tbe authority af the
Government, or that tbe Govertiment wonld
see tbat tbey were buiît? The leader of the
Gavernment cannat deny that. Is that leaving
the National Railways ta an independent
board? Tbat brings politics into tbe C.N.R.
It is bad enough withaut palîties. Imagine
trying ta salve the unemployment situation
by building new terminais in Montreai! Yon
are fallawing the path taken by the United
States.
The railraad business is a diminishing
business. It cannat be anytbing else. The
band of the monster af ecanomics is an it,
and it cannat belp going down. I do not
say it is going ta become extinct; it will always
be a great business; but it cannot occupy the
paramaunt position it occupied in years gane
by. Competition becomes keener year after
year. We are making it more difficuit
for the self-sustaining road. Ail tbat we bave
dons for years bas been nothing but a
challenge ta the maney invested in that road.
Now we are gaing abead ta ereet big terminais
in Montreal, wbere nobody is suffering without tbem. Millions are ta be spent for a
systemn wbase business from this day on is
baund ta go down in relation ta tbat af its
competitors. And this is ta be done in the
name af unemployment assistance.
The policy the Government is pursuing is just the policy of drift. It may
be the one tbat wiil lase the least votes.
I do not know. I neyer was much of a
judge af sucb matters. But I do know
that this *policy must be reversed or tbe
unemployment probiem wili neyer be sensibly
attacked in this Dominion of Canada. You
mnust start in a new raIe, s0 that you may
bave a balance. You must reduce debt so
that you may get things done. You must
make it possible for people ta get sometbing
if they put their money into the employment af labour instead af hiding it in a Gov.
ernment bond. Do that and you may make
a start in solving the unemployment problem
Sometimes I think it wauld be better if
tbese boans, instead af being welcomed by the
investiag public, were ignored. I am nat

sure that Alberta is nlot in as good a position
as any province. The reason is :that the Government of Alberta kiiled or siaug-htered the
credit of that province. If they could nlot
borrow, they could nlot spend; therefore 1their
cash position may now be the best of any.
If something similar happened this Government. our position in a few years would be
better, flot worse.
I ar n ot giving credit
to the Aberhart administration for what they
did. I cannot think of anything more stupid.
But it had this effect: it paralysed their
borrowing power and made fhemn live more
economicaily. It is truc that they put on
more taxes. If they wou]d keep their taxes
down and reduce their Goveroment charges,
Aiberta would be the most prosperous province in this Dominion. That I say only by
way of illustration.
I come now to another subject. I shall not
have much to say about it, for I have talked
about it in years gone by and have nothing
new to add. The Speech from the Throne refers to the necessity of increasing our defences. Two or thrcc of its paragraphs are
very rnanifestly directed to the conciliation
of thosc elements of our population who are
against war expenditure of any kind. The
Government have been convinced by the developments of recent months-and likely the
process of convincing themn has been going on
since long before-that more must be donc in
the way of defence expenditure and preparation than we have been doing in the past. I
am in accord with that view. Undoubtedly
we have to do more, and undoubtedly this
expenditure-an expenditure which employscannot be avoided. I shall offer no resistance
to the plans of the Goverament in this regard, but shahl wclcomc them.
However
from reading the Speech from the Throne one
would think that if we just spent five millions
more here and five millions more there in the
way of ilefence, or niaybe f on or twentv
millions more, we should be safe in this littie
home of ours; that as we were taking care
of the situation, we could look after ourselves, hid defiance to the worid, and sleep at
nighrt. The Goveromnent do not believe that
for a minute.
Hon Mr. DANDURAND:
say that.

They do not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No, but that
is impiied. There is not a reference to cooperation. There aiways was in days gone by.
Up to five years ago, in any reference to defence, the principie of co-operation with real
defene was the feature emphasized.
But
this Government do not emphasize it. Why?
Why ail this hypocrisy? Why aIl this preRt. Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

tence that we are going to look after our
own defence? The leader of the Government
knows we neyer did so and never can.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: There is no
such thing as a separate defence of our country. 1 ask again, why ail the hypocrisy? We
have to do our part, it is trucHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Why does the
righit honourable gentleman speak of hypocrisy when hie approves of the expenditure
that is going on?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Certainly
I approvo of expenditure to strengthen our
defences; but only f0 the extent that the
money is used in a policy directed towards
co-operation with the reai dofonce of this
country is the expenditure justified. Therefore there should be reference fo that
co-operation. Whien the hour of trial cornes
we cannot defend ourselves. We nover did
and never dreamed that we could. Why can
we flot say we are working in co-operation
with that groat country wvhich has been our
defence ail through the life of this Dominion
of 'ours?
1 know why the Gov ernment do not say
it. They know it; everyone. I think, knows
it. Did we not have the Prime Minister iast
September issuing a stafernent felling of
flhc terrible anixiety aod fthe terrible toil
through wbich lie had passe(l, an(l the
immense amount
of work hoe anti bis
officiais had donc during the crisis of that
montbi? I can realize that hoe vent thmough
days of anxiety. 1 do not know what days
of toil hie could have gone through that
necessitated three weeks of recuperation in
the Caribbean.
If there was toil, lot us
know what decisions were arriî cd at. What
wvas the harvest of that toil? Tell us what
the Government decided f0 do. Did the
work consist rnerely of decoding cablegrams
freim England?
If it did flot, there must
baveo been products of the foul and the deliherations that almost wrecked the Prime Minister. Let us know what those produots wore.
1 said I couid understand the anixiety.
Why was there anxiety? Nohody was threatening war on Canada. Then why the anxiety?
The anxiety was foit because the Prime
Minister knew, the leader of the Government
in this House knew, every membeýr of the
Goveroment knew, that a peril to the power
of Eng-land was a peril to us. They knew
there was peril in the whoie atmosphere of
Europe, and the peril to Britain's power was
a peril to the security of Canada. I do flot,
wonder that the Prime Minister was worried,

23

JANUARY 17, 1939
and I do flot begrudge him his rest ini the
Caribbean. But the reason of the worry
was as I have stated it just now. Why do
we keep on parading ourselves as capable
of looking after the interests of Canada? Why
this parade in every line where defence is
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne?
It is not the truth. We know it is flot the
truth.
The Speech says also that though we are
getting ready to defend ourselves, we are making friends with other countries. The inference is, no doubt, that if we succeed well
enough in making friends with those countries
they will flot attack us. But with whom are
we making f riends? First, with the United
States. That is quite right. But who ever was
afraid of the United States attacking us? We
are making friends in a trade way with Great
Britain. That is quite right. There is no
treaty referred to anywhere else. The rest
of the situation remains just as it was: the
danger stays j ust as it was.
I read a speech the other day by one of the
senators bere-the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
I was
appalled to think that such a deliverance
could corne fromn an honourable member of
this House. I was appalled that we, a portion
of the British Empire, a portion of democracy
whose first line of defence is the Old Land,
should proclaim it our duty to run to the
coat-tails of Uncle Sam and tell hîm that if
hie will lead we will follow.
I suppose the Government are in constant
touch with the British Admiralty and with the
British War Office. I beg the Government to,
tell us frankly that they are taking part in
Empire defence; that they are interested in
the security of Britain, for they are and must
always be; that they are interested in the
security of France, and that in the defence of
democracy they will not wait until threequarters of its defences have gone. Let us
talk common sense. Let us make use of the
instincts of bonour and the compulsions of
reason that we believe if, every day of our
]ives, and apply them to these matters of 11f e
and death. That is what we are not doing.
I arn only too eager for Canada to, do its
share-do ail it can. We know we cannot do
everything, but we can assist the Old Land
in certain ways. We know we are interested
tremendously in bier strengtb; that that
strengtb shields us as nothing else can shield
us. We ought Vo stand up frankly and so
declare, and so teach our people in every
province of this Dominion, instead of trying
Vo conceal it as we are doing day by day,
and as is manifestly attempted in this Speech
from the Throne.

That is the appeal I make to the leader of
the Government. On the facts hie cannot have
any other opinion than that which I have expressed. He bas neyer given expression to any
other opinion, for bas the Prime Minister.
Why not be frank about it ail? Wby continue to have the fact cloaked under this
smoky atmosphere of independent defence by
ourselves, something we know we are utterly
incapable of, something we neyer professed
before, and wbich we know we cannot possibly
develop in days to corne?
I have no more remarks to make about this
Speech from the Throne. I close by suggesting that when the Senate resumes after the
coming adjournment we reappoint the committee which at the end of last session was
drawing to a close its labours with respect to
our railway problem, and that we seek to geV
that phase of our work effectively done before
we address ourselves to the major work of thîs
session.
I promise the leader of the Government
to co-operate with him to the utmost and in
the friendliest way to make this one of tbe
most'useful sessions in our history.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN

REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Marshall for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I desire first to thank the mover
(Hon. Mr. Marshall) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Prévost) of this Address for the very
informative speeches which they have delivered in this Chamber. I must thank the
honourable gentleman from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) for baving given us information of
a kind which very few members of the Senate
possessed. I always feel that this House is

24

SENATE

the better for any positive information,
technical though it may sometimes be, that
falls from the lips of members of this House.
I may say also of the honourable gentleman
from Mille Iles (Hon. Mr. Prévost), a highly
cultured journalist of my province, that I am
always delighted to hear his remarks, because
both the matter and the form are excellent.
I desire to join with the honourable gentlemen who have spoken before me in assuring Their Majesties that they will be welcome
among their Canadian subjects. I am quite
sure that their reception in this country will
he quite as warn as that which was
extended to them by Great Britain's ally,
France, last summer.
The general opinion in Paris was that this young couple
who
adorn th
Throne
were particularly attractive to everybody because of their
simplicity and charm. They have already
conquered the hearts of aIl the members of
the British fanily with whom they have been
in contact, and they have won the esteem
and admiration of aIl communities outside of
Great Britain wbich they have visited. I
am quite sure that in Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacifie, they will be received
with open arms.
The international situation in Europeand, I might add, in Asia-is still quite beclouded. When the Rome-Berlin axis was
proclaimed,
whereby the Germans were
allowed to invade Austria, one naturally
wondered what payment Mussolini had been
promised by Hitler for the assistance he was
to receive from Rome. We aIl knew that
Mussolini, a practical politician, would expect
some return for the permission he had given
the Germans to come as far as the Brenner
Pass, which borders upon Italy. I felt that the
compensation expected would be substantial,
and, as I lad a fair knowledge of the situation
in northern Africa. I knew that Mussolini had
his eye upon Tunisia. which I visited two or
three years ago. A French newspaper stated
that it was clear the Fuehrer had paid Italy
with a blank cheque or draft on France.
Mussolini's problem is to cash that cheque,
and perhaps he will find that more difficult
than it was for Germany to threaten to invade
the Sudeten district.
The Italian policy of aggression seemed
quite clear to all those who could read the
newspapers. Wben the French Ambassador in
Berlin, Mr. François-Poncet, was transferred
to Rome, he was received not merely with
coolness, but in a most unusual manner. In
fact. he was told that he was not needed
in Rome. We ail knew, of course, that such
a statement appearing in the Italian press could
not have been made without the authorization
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of the Italian Government.
In order to
frighten Great Britain while Italy was asking
that ber aspirations be allowed, ber partner,
Germany, announced a desire for parity with
Great Britain in the matter of submarines, just
as Mussolini had announced mobilization during the crisis of September last. To those who
knew the game being played by Rome and
Berlin it was evident that these were threats
to Great Britain or France.
The question is, what will the morrow bring?
The third ally, Japan, has lately become quite
defiant, even towards the United States. Will
Hitler and Mussolini decide upon a throw of
the dice before Great Britain has fully rearmed, and risk their ail during the present
year? That is the question. The United States
are arming in haste. The repeal of their
Neutrality Act would be enough to sober the
would-4be aggressors.
It is the duty of Canada to strengthen its
own defences. The Speech from the Throne
explains the necessity of increasing the appropriations for defence in order to safeguard
this country frorm danger of attack. I must
say I was most surprised to hear my right
honourable friend (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighen)
state with some vehemence that while he
would not object if we spent millions here or
there for defence, it was sheer hypocrisy to give
the people the impression that this country
could thereby be protected against assault,
for everyone knew that Canada could not
protect itself without co-operation. He declared the Government did not dare to say
that it would co-operate with Great Britain
for the protection of Canada.
My rigbt
honourable friend at times uses harsh expressions which serve as headlines in friendly
newspapers. but are quite beyond his sober
judgment, I am sure. He must smile at times
to see the effect of his big words on the press,
or sections of the press, of this country.
The Government is organizing its defences
to meet any emergency. It does not know
what might be the circumstances it would
have to meet. It does not know in advance
with whom it would have to co-operate. AIl
it knows is that it must protect this country
against any attack; and attacks naturally would
come from the Pacific or the Atlantie.
The right honourable gentleman did not
state what would be Canada's obligations and
those of Great Britain under an agreement
which would have to be reached, as suggested
in 1885 by Sir John A. Macdonald. He did
not state what would be the measure of our
co-operation.
He did not state who would
dictate the policy, which might lead to war.
Does he expect that Canada will agree to
dance to the tune of any British Government,
be it Tory, Liberal, Labour or Socialist; that

JANUARY 18, 1939
Canada, whether it approves or not, will have
to say yes? Does lie say that when the policy
is shortly afterwaras reversed by the people of
Great Britain at the polls we are to be
obliged to say "Amen," and that when there
is a shift to the original position we are to
submit to whatever may be the result of this
changeable and uncertain policy?
Within a period of five years I witnessed
the double somersault of three British governments. In 1924 the Government of Ramsay MacDonald agreed to sign at Geneva
the optional clause with respect to compulsory arbitration of matters of a legal or
justiciable nature before the International
Tribunal at The Hague. Canada was favourable to that policy, and said so. Two months
later the people rejected the MacDonald
Government at the polls, and the BaldwinChamberlain Government discarded that optional clause respecting compulsory arbitration. Canada had to mark time, but became
impatient of delay, and our Prime Minister
declared at the session of 1929 that we would
proceed to adhere to that -optional clause
after notifying the members of the Commonwealth. In June of that year the Baldwin
Government was defeated, mainly, as I was
told, on its international policy at Geneva,
and the Ramsay MacDonald Government,
which was again returned, signed the optional
clause.
Now, I ask the right honourable
gentleman, would his plan of co-operation
force Canada to be at the beck and call of
every wabbling British government? Are we
reverting to the status of a Crown colony?
I have heard many statements from men
of note indicating that history wilI be severe
on the uncertainty of the policy of Great
Britain since 1920. Some three or four years
ago a brilliant British journalist said to a
Frenchman who was confessing that France
had very unstable governments:
"That is
so, but you have a stable policy. We have
a stable government, but no stable policy."
At times my right honourable friend has
allowed his imperialism to carry him to
extremes. In his famous Toronto speech in
1922 he was even ready to follow that unreliable Welshman, Mr. Lloyd George, who
wanted Canada to send troops to Chanak to
defend the Dardanelles against the Turks. If
my right honourable friend had been at the
helm would he have said "Ready, aye ready"
without consulting Parliament? At times he
recognizes the supremacy of Parliament and
is even ready to consult the people as to the
extent of our contributions to Great Britain's
wars. The right honourable gentleman went
from Toronto to Hamilton.

I may say that on this question the Liberal
policy has not varied from the time of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier's pronouncement in 1910,
which affirms the authority of the Canadian
Parliament in the matter of our co-operation
in a conflict which does not affect Canada
directly, and to-day the Prime Minister, Mr.
King, reaffirms the sole authority of the
Canadian Parliament with regard to our
participation in any such conflict.
The Speech from the Throne declares that
it is the duty of Canada to strengthen her
defence. She must do so in order to face two
possible contingencies: first, to defend our
neutrality, if the United States be involved;
second, to resist attack resulting from an
embargo which Canada may decree with
respect to a state which is an aggressor
against the Commonwealth. President Roosevelt bas said as much for the United States.
That country and Canada, with or without
their signatures to the Briand-Kellogg pact,
could not do otherwise, nor less. They could
not submit to becoming accomplices of an
aggressor.
Canada's ex.penditure is exclusively for
defence. It- involves or implies no question
of military expeditions abroad. The present
Prime Minister bas repeated that statement
more than once on the floor of the House of
Commons; and lately the preceding Prime
Minister, Mr. Bennett, expressed the same
view at, I think, Calgary, if not at Edmonton
or Vancouver. Of course, Parliament remains
supreme, and it may decide otherwise. My
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has suggested a most important
safeguard, for fear that Parliament may not
represent public opinion. His suggestion is
that an appeal be made to the people. Here
are excerpts from his Hamilton speech of
November 17, 1925. I take these from the
Montreal Gazette, and if he desires that his full
statement be quoted I will put it on Hansard.
He said:
I do not anticipate that we of this generation will ever be called upon to take part in
war again, and I earnestly hope that our children and our children's children may be free
from the curse of war, but if ever the time
should come when the spectre of 1914 should
again appear I believe it would be best, not
only that Parliament should be called, but the
decision of the Government, which, of course,
would have to be given promptly, should be
submitted to the judgment of the people at a
general election before troops should leave our
shores. This would contribute to the unity of
our country in the months to come and would
enable us best to do our duty.

26

SENATE

Further on he repeats the sane view in
another form:
I have myself iot the slightest doubt that
if danger threatened Canada again, this country
would respond as it responded in 1914, but I
believe in future it will be best for all that
before a Government takes a step so momentous
as the dispatch of troops the will of the people
should be known. Canada wants peace, the
whole Empire wants peace, and our policy will
be directed to that goal.
My right honourable friend suggested consultation of the people because, in his own
words, " This would contribute to the unity of
our country in the months to come, and
would enable us best to do our duty." I fully
agree with that view of my right honourable
friend, except that instead of a dissolution of
Parliament I should prefer a referendum.
I believe that sufficient attention bas not
been given to the words spoken by the Prime
Minister at Geneva in 1936. In his speech
before the League of Nations, on September
29 of that year, he said:
What I have said and quoted does not mean
that in no circumstances would the Canadian
people be prepared to share in action against
an aggressor; there have been no absolute commitments either for or against participation in
war or other forms of force. It does mean
tiat any decision on the part of Canada to
participate in war will have to be taken by
the Parliament or people of Canada in the
liglit of all existing circumstances: circumstances of the day as they exist in Canada,
as well as in the areas involved.
I was near the Prime Minister at the time
he spoke, and I knew the importance of
those words.
My right honourable friend has suggested
consultation of the people, to maintain the
unity of the nation. There is hardly any
doubt that if to-day or to-morrow a Government decided to recommend to Parliament
the sending abroad of expeditionary forces
it would find itself with a Rump cabinet
when facing Parliament, and that, surely,
would not make for unity. The only alternative would then be the policy propounded
by my right honourable friend, an appeal to
the people.
My right honourable friend and I, in supporting that policy, are but echoing the opinion of the old chieftain, Sir John A. Macdonald, who refused to send troops to Egypt
in 1885 and would undoubtedly have sent
them only in response to a pressing demand
or mandate fromn the people. In a letter to
Sir Charles Tupper. dated March 12, 1885
he stated the Governrment thought the time

our volunteering military aid to the Mother
Country. He added:
We do not stand at all in the same position

us, and we do not ask England to quarrel with
France or Germany for our sakes.
Mark these following words:
Again, the reciprocal aid to be given by the
colonies and England should be a matter of
treaty, deliberately entered into and settled on
a permanent basis. The spasmodie offers of our
militia colonels, anxious for excitement or
notoriety, have roused unreasonable expectations in England, and are so far unfortunate.
Honourable senators will note that problems referred to by Sir John A. Macdonald
are still with us, unsettled. But there is one
point that bas never been in question: the
defence of our country if ever attacked.
Now I come to the trade agreement with
the United States of America. It provides
wider markets for our Canadian products,
and involves an important revision of the
Canadian tariff structure. It will lead to a
much greater reduction of taxes on trade than
bas ever before been attempted. Modification of existing Imperial agreements was
agreed upon between the United Kingdom
and Canada. The intra-Inperial convention
was terminable in August, 1940, and the convention of 1935 with the United States was
terminable December 31, 1938. The new conventions ensure that the benefits accruing to

Our constitutional limitations have hampered long-range remedies, but within the

by the measures they have adopted and

The Dominion Government have taken active
measures to stimulate private employment

National Housing Act, and the Municipal Improvements Assistance Act. Under these measures certain local taxes have been assumed,
and loans made to individuals, organizations
and municipalities.
The sales tax bas been
eliminated on important building materials.
Special aid bas been given to the mining industry by subventions, tax exemptions and improved transportation facilities. At the same
time, direct employment bas been increased

public works, and through assistance given to
the provinces in the construction of highways,
for land settlement, for special projects for
farm employment and for forest conservation.

SENATE

It is the considered judgment of the Canadian National Railways that the best interests
of the railway and of the public will be served
by a co-ordination of the terminails of the
company at Montreal in the manner decided
upori. No engineering project bas been more
fully examined than that for the creation of
a Central Station on the Dorchester Street site.
The substitute plans for taking the lines of
the Canadian National into Windsor Street
station were also closely studied by inlependent
engineering authority and fournd to be incompatible w ith securing the efficiency and economy
sought for, and providing for the growth anti
development of the city.
Of all the plans which have been put forward
at varions timres to solve the grade separation
and railway transportation problem of the City
of Montreal, the Canadian National plan w as
the one wxhich was selected by that eminent
engineer Sir Frederick Pahner, M.Inst.C.E.,
M.Am.Soc.C.E., as being the best adapted to
the requireients of the city.
It will be recalled that wxhen there was
submitted to the Govermrnent an alternative
plan based on the use of Windsor Street station
the Hon. C. A. Dunning, then Minister of
Railways and Canals, decided to obtain the
best available independent engineering advice,
and Sir Frederick Palmer, who had wide experience in the development of ports and terminals in various countries, was selected. After
examnining in all twenty proposals, lie reported
to the Federal Governiment that the Canadian
National terminal plan was the one best adapted
to the requirements of the city. Sir Frederick
stated:
"It is believed that every one of tiese proposals bas been carefully considered (certainly
all the known proposals have been examinred),
and

it

is

no

disparagemîent

to even

the

best

of tiese schemes to say that the C.N.R. plan.
which has resulted fron prolonged study of
the question in all its aspects by the extremîely
competent officials of that railway, is inconparably the best."
ln the concluding remarks of his report,
dealing w ith two last-minute alternatives, Sir
Frederick said:
"The purpose for which tiese two belated
proposals arc submuitted is not understood.
There is nothing to recommend one or the other,
and it is obvions that they are 'conproise'
suggestions. in whicli the true nreeds of Montreal are sacrificed to vestedi interests.
The
only lesson to be learned fron themr is that if
they represent the best that can be devised as
alternatives thereto, the Tunnel proposal stands
without a real comrpetitor."
Before reaching a decision to recommence
the work on the terminal, on a modified plan,
the wihole situation was agair reviewed by the
Canadian National, and the conclusion was
reacied that judgei from the requirenents of
the railway for improved and co-ordinated
terminal facilities as well as the relationship
of terminals to the development of the coimunity, the Central Station plan should be
ield to.
In
considering the possibility of
using
Windsor Street station it became evident that
only a portion of the trains could be routed
into that station vithout a serions increase in
mnileage and slowing d iown schedules.
of
The
problem of trains from the west presented
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

little difficulty, but the routes of all trains
from the east using Bonaventure Station would
have to be increased by twenty-one miles and
passengers on these trains, after coming within
sight of Montreal at St. Lambert, would have
to be taken twenty-six miles by a circuitous
route to cross the St. Lawrence River at
Caughnawaga.
It
is also impracticable to
make use of Windsor Street station for the
Canadian National trains which presently use
Tunnel terminal and McGill Street.
Joint
studies in 1933 developed that the use of
Windsor Street station, even to a limited extent, would involve an expenditure of $6,000,000
for the station and coach yard and the aimost
certain expenditure of an additional $2,000,000
for grade separation, with the further knowledge that any substantial inerease in passenger
traffic would lead to a further expenditure
of raany millions of dollars. Tiese expenditures
instead of affording an opportunity of improving railway service into Montreal would actually
deteriorate it.
Fron
the widcr aspect of the city and
travelling public the expenditure of mroney to
enlarge the Windsor Street stub-end station
and to force all railway passenger traffic entering the city, except froin the west, to muake a
roirndabout circuit to reach it, would be unjustifiable.
On the other liand. the Central
Station is well iocated to serve the requiremuents of the C.N.R. or of a union terminal if
such should be decided upon.
Expenditures
upon it would at all timies fit into the development of the City on broad regional lines and
insure the handling of traffic in and out of
the city with the greatest degree of expedition.
It is perhaps net generally understood that,
as comrpared with Wrindsor Street station, the
use of the C.N.R. Central Station shortens the
distances to northern, castern and southerîn
points.
The conclusion is unavoidable that to spend
noney at this tinre trying to adapt Windsor
Street station to the larger requireients of
the city would be unjustifiable, whereas money
expended at present in accordance with the
general plan whici received the approval of Sir
Frederick Palher as being the best adapted to
union terminal requiremients. taking the long
view, would be wx
isely expended. Sir Frederick
summnarized this aspect of the situation by
stating that for various reasons, set out in
detail in the report. "Windsor Street, besides
having other disabilities, is not in reality a
Union Station. l'ie Tunnel site, on the other
iandn., possesses every attribute which a Central
Station can bave."
The plan of the Canadian
îNrational consists
of more than the provision of a central passonger station which could be adiapted as a
union station. The plan is a solution of the
probleim of co-ordinating disconnected terminals
of the Canadian National at th Tunnel terminai, Bonaventure and MCGill Street, so that
the operations cari be carried on more satisfactorily than at present, and also to enable
the railway to naeet the growing industrial
requirenrents of the city and alleviate the grade
crossing problem to a great extent. Convenient
and expeditious freigit service, ailthougli not
so noticeable as passenger service. is of even
greater importance in aiding in the development of the city.
When the Bonaventure Station area bas been
relieved of passenger traffie, it will lie possible
to nrake mucb needed inprovements in that

JANUARY 18. 1939
area, by modernizing the freight facilities, including the provision of modern freiglit sheds.
Provision for industrial warehouses with rail
connection in the area between St. Henri and
Bonaventure will also be possible as traffic
requirements warrant.
The removal of the
coach yard from St. Henri area, to the Point
St. Charles area will permit of the re-arrangement of the main freight yards at Turcot,
which will resuit not only in a very substantial
economy, but will also enable the traffie in
and ont of Montreal to be handled more
expeditiously. It will also be possible to c'onstruct a second highway on the portion of
the Victoria Bridge which is now occupied by
the Montreal and Southern Counties Railway.
This will afford an improved highway approach
to the city and to the South Shore communities.
Jncreased opportunities for traffic will be
created by these Ineasures, and substantial
economies will be effected.
Among the economies which wiIl result are
the consolidation of passenger stations, the
shortening of distance mun by ahl passenger
trains frnm the east and south, a saving ini
switching costs, economies f rom the operation
of a modemn coach yard for passenger rolling
stock and economies f rom the use of electric
traction for passenger trains and switching
movements.

A motion to

but after that motion is defeated something

This was the rule in the

prevented any debate whiatever on a motion

an end to any debate; you could carry it on
for the whole summer.
That is why the
closure rule became necessary in the Commons.

JANUARY 18, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to this
situation. War may occur between Japan and
the United States, and we may be obliged ta
see to the defences on our coast. In such
a case the United States would be our ally,
because she would have to defend and help
us, and Great Britain would not, perhaps,
come to the rescue of the United States. We
should be on the firing line.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman seriously keep in mind
what he is saying: that if war breaks out between the United States and Japan, Canada
might become involved without Britain? We
might have to defend our neutrality. I am not
certain that from that particular date forward
we should not be faced with war. The moment
we are at war we know who our ally is. We
know that our friend, progenitor and protector through history, not our ally, will be at
our side from that very moment and will
share in the conflict. The honourable gentleman has no more doubt about that than that
he is sitting in his seat. That is why I say
we should prepare our defence in co-operation,
so that the defence of one will be a part of
the defence of all. That is the only hope of
safety for this Dominion.
The honourable gentleman wishes to leave
the impression that I have not always been
consistent. I think I have, and I shall
endeavour in a very few moments to review
the facts. The honourable gentleman states
that in the city of Toronto-I think the year
mentioned was 1922-I was guilty of uttering
a phrase, "Ready, aye ready," the implication being that Canada was to be ready at all
ti-mes, as he puts it, " to dance to the tune of
a British Government." Such were not the
circumstances at all. The circumstances were
these. Great Britain and the other allies had
made a treaty with Turkey. Canada had
become a separate party to the sane treaty.
That treaty contained certain prohibitions and
stipulations. Canada signed it from the standpoint of her own obligations. It was submitted to the Parliament of Canada. The
gentleman who subinitted for approval that
treaty, with its mutual obligations, was none
other than the present Prime Minister of
Canada. In the innocence of my heart I felt
that we had some interest in the treaty. I did
not think we had signed it sim.ply that we
might thereafter boast of entering international affairs and of having set the seal of
Canada to the treaty, and pride ourselves on
all the glare emanating from such action.
I thought we signed it seriously because we
had something ta gain as a unit of the world
community. I thought we had some interest.
Was I wrong?

31

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the
right honourable gentleman was. If he could
show me the obligation we assumed under
any treaty with Turkey I should like to see it.
When the Greeks were assailing the Turks,
was it not the duty of the Turks to protect
themselves?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is off the track altogether.
If he will keep on the track his mind is all
right. I did not say we bound ourselves to go
ta the defence of Turkey, or of Greece, or of
any power. I said we had some obligations
under the treaty. I do not know now what
they were, but I know I am not wrong. I can
hardly imagine our signing a treaty that
represents nothing to us. I should hardly
think the honourable gentleman would be a
member of a Government which would ask us
to ratify such a treaty. But the Government,
of which he was a member, commended the
treaty to Parliament; therefore we had an
interest in it. We had an interest in seeing
its obligations performed. Now, there came
a time when in the judgment of the British
Government-and I think their judgment was
right, though I could not argue the matter at
this late date-that treaty was violated by
Turkey.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was it by
Turkey? Was it not by Greece?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I could not
argue that matter, but in the judgment of the
Government, in which I do not think they
were likely to be wrong, as we know how
carefully they deliberate in all these mattersat all events, in their judgmentHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why doubt
that?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Doubt what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That the difficulty or the conflict was between Greece and
Turkey, and that Great Britain never claimed
the right to intervene.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly
Greece had been one of the allies and had
signed the sarne treaty, and the treaty was
mutually executed. All I said was that in
the judgment of the British Government the
treaty was violated by Turkey, and that we
were asked by message whether we had an
interest to the extent of desiring to participate in maintaining the terms of the treaty.
I felt that a reply should have been sent to
indicate at least mutuality of interestHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was
none.

32

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Very good.
That is a matter of faot.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. The despatchi
was sent by Lloyd George and Winston
Church ill without the knowledge of the
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now we are
getting into the domestic affairs of the British
Goveroment. But it is flot a fact that it was
sent without the authority of the Government. This is shown definitely by the correspondence published by Winston Churchill,
which I have read. It was sent by the Governmeot, whcther they should have sent it or
not. It was oothing in the nature of a command to Canada; it was a mere inquiry as to
our attitude in respect of a treaty in whjch
it was assumed we had an interest because we
had signed it.
Now, I say in respect of a treaty of that
kind. which we have executed as an autonomous nation of the Empire, it is the duty of
Canada to make a reply such as I have indicated. But if the honourable gentleman is
afraid of those words, if those words carry
to him something so Imperial that his eye
cannot look upon thema, I will tell him who
originated them in my mind; who first used
them in my hearing; who used themn with my
full approval.
That gentleman was Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Sir Wilfrid Laurier used
those words with a vastly wider application
than I did when I used them in relation to
British support. I refer my honourable friend
to the speech Sir Wilfrid made in the House
of Commons, and which is reported in Hansard.
The honourable gentleman will find the words
used with a much widor import than I used
themn, but I have not heard hima cite them
in condemnation of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Thon the honourable gentleman comes to
anothor speech, one which 1 made at Hamilton
about three yoars lator. I have already sought
to expound to the people of this country the
reasons which actuated me thon, and what I
had in mi.
The honourable gentleman has
read correctlv what I said. H1e lias read sufficient. No more is necessary. He did not
suppress anything. What I had in mind was
the doing of something to prevent the disunity
of this country if the dread hour should strike
again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
with my honourable friend.

Well, I agree

since? It is tremeodously important that in

years to follow we do ot get ioto any racial
quarrel in Canada; that we seek to get the
utmost measure of unity from the very moment
we enter a confiict. That is something which
is worth considerable sacrifice to-day and was
worth the same then. It would have been
worth sacrificing something even in the last
coofliet. We are able to sec now that through
three years of the late confliet we played our
part without the expressed authority of the
people of Canada for what we wcrc doing.
We did so right up to 1917, when we got the
authority. If we had obtained it at first there
would have been a greater measure of unity
throughout than was actually witnessed.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Consequontly
it seoms to me I wvas cnunciating a course that
could be followod to gather together the
greatcst measure of unity-you nover cao get
it complte-to marshal the greatcst measure
of unity of which this country is capable. That
was ail 1 had in mmnd, and I thought I made
that cloar. Cortainly I did in a furthcr exposition about ton or twclve years later.
I said oothing in the nature of advocating
a referendum. That is not the British systcm.
It is ot the sound system. Democracy will
flot work undor refcrendums. I hope I shall
nt ho guilty of exaggeration if I express the
fear that if you submitted to the people a
referendum as to whether you should repudiate
the national debt it might carry. What is my
honourable frieod's guess?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ot be
a party to submittiog any immoral policy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is that aoy
more a moral issue than the question of what
we should do in a matter of life and death?
No, I would ot submit to any referendum.
I said 1 would ask the Goveroment to go to
the couotry at once, aod if I wore the bond
I would support in the election evcry member
of the House. o matter what side he was on,

conflict in which we cao take part. Doos ho?
Take caret
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: According to
my righit honourable friend, without submitting it to the people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is what
I said.
Very good.
But the honourablc
gentleman says that as soon as it is submitted
it will split the country in twain.

JANUARY 18, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say that to
obtain the opinion of the people soberly you
must eliminate all those questions which
would divert their attention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
way to get an immoral verdict, and you might
get one that way on the national debt and a
good many other things. I prefer the British
fashion of having the representatives of the
people elected on the issue. And I prefer that
a government who have to take a responsibility should take it and go to the country
to get its support, instead of looking upon
this as being some remote issue that does not
mean the life or death of a nation. The
honourable gentleman can have his preference,
but I hope I shall not be here if the time ever
comes when that view prevails. The Government would have to go to the country for
support for their policy, even if there were a
referendum, and fight to the death. There
would be no prevention of a split on a
referendum, but there would be a perilous and
îtupid breach of British history and tradition.
I know that when I made my suggestion I
did not carry very many of the leading Conservatives of the country with me. I must
assume, therefore, that I was wrong; but
perhaps I was not. However. I took the
responsibility for what I said under the circumstances of that time, and I acted accordingly.
Circumstances throughout the world change;
war m.ethods change; lightning attack succeeds
long-prepared attack, and circumstances at
some future time might be such that we could
not follow the course I suggested. I do not
know. I do not think they are yet such that
we could not follow it. I am inclined to think
that what I suggested is just about what the
present Government would do if they found
themselves in that most unfortunate plight
which I had in mind. However, I am only
defending what I said at the time, and I feel
sure still that at the time it was right. My
confidence in the wisdom of that course is just
as strong to-day as it ever was.
My honourable friend says we do not know
with whom we might be allied in a war.
I am disheartened to hear that statement from him. Certainly we know. And
he intimates that it would be very risky
to tie ourselves up with Great Britain, because
the government over there changes so often.
The British people may support a certain kind
of policy to-day, and six months or a year
later they may reverse their decision; therefore, my honourable friend suggests, we cannot co-operate with them in matters of defence. Does that follow? I know that
changes occur in Great Britain. So they do
in every democratic country. But does that
71498-3

33

mean we cannot co-operate with Great Britain

in a great scheme for defence? Does not
France change its policy and its government?
Why, sometimes a number of swift changes
are made in one year. That fact does not
prevent Great Britain fron co-operating with
France in matters of defence. A moment
after a new government bas been put into
power in France the co-operation with Great
Britain is just as intimate, just as real and
just as useful as it was under the preceding
government. And surely we have more in
common with Britain than Britain has with
France. France's common interest with
Britain is that of defence. We, too, share
that common interest with Britain, but we
share far more than that. It is a serious
and terrible thing to hear the leader of the
Government in this House say that they do
not know any whom we might be fighting with
in the next war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would depend on the circumstances.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman mean that we might
not be fighting on the side of Britain, if we
fought at all?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Britain might
not be in the picture.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We in the
picture and Britain not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What? Surely
the honourable gentleman did not think
before he made that statement! He tells
this House-and his statement will be spread
all over Canada-that we might be in a war
when Britain was not on our side, and indeed
not in the war at all. There is not the
slightest chance of that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might be
obliged to defend ourselves.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We know who
will be behind us when we have to defend
ourselves; and we will never start fighting

till we do know.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman understands that. These
are terrible issues. The time may come when
the words of the honourable member will
sound very strange in this country. Indeed,
that time will come to-morrow morning.
There may come also a time when the honourable member will wish he had never uttered
those words. That will be when the hour of
trouble falls upon us. We know very well

SENATE

34

that we shall never strike a blow unless Great
Britain agrees with the course we take and
is ready to stand at our side. To say that
because changes occur in the government of
Great Britain we cannot co-operate with that
country in matters of defence is a statement
unworthy of the intellect of my honourable
friend. Changes in the British government
would net affect our co-operation in the
slightest. The determination of Great Britain
to maintain her integrity against her foes is
a determination that never changes, and in
that determination and its consequent policy
we can co-operate. I simply say that in the
great policy of defence we ought to begin to
co-operate with Great Britain at once.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'I would draw
my right honourable friend's attention to the
statement of Sir John A. Macdonald that we
should not enter into any British war without
having our obligations defined under an agreement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIQHEN: My honourable friend referred to that before, but I
did net answer it because I did net think it
deserved an answer. The situation of fifty
or sixty years ago is not the situation of
to-day. What Sir John A. Macdonald had
in mind was that we should not participate
in every little conflict in which Great Britain
became engaged, such as a fight in Egypt,
in Abyssinia, and se on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
or France.

Or in Germany

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Doos anybody doubt where Sir John A. Macdonald
would have stood with regard to any lifeand-death struggle?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

What he
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
suggested was that we oughît te enter into
an arrangement as to what we will do. We
are not entering into such an arrangement
to-day. I do net know but that we might
well do se, but I am not suggesting that we
should. I would not go se far as he did in
that respect. I am simply urging that we
enter into a policy of co-operation for defence;
and I mean defence against what might result
in our destruction or subjection. I am not
thinking at all of little sporadic actions in
which Great Britain might be engaged here,
there and everywhere, such as that which is
going on in Palestine to-day. What I arn
concerned with is whether this country is
going te remain free or net. I ask the honourable leader of this House and the wbole
Government to keep in mind that that is the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

kind of issue we are facing. The issue is not
such as my honourable friend keeps harping
upon every now and again, as to whether
we shall send an expedition to Abyssinia or
to Egypt.
I would point
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
out to my right honourable friend that we
cannot bind ourselves to participate in any
and every war in which Great Britain is
engaged.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
asking that, and never have asked that. Nor
bave I ever suggested that Parliament should
endorse that kind of thing. And this talk
about Parliament having to decide before we
take part in a war is simply the uttering of
words without any meaning. Certainly Parliament bas to decide on everything that a
government does; but when a government
proclaims that its policy is to let Parliament
decide, it is only saying in effect that it does
not know what on earth te do.
The present
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Coveornment bas said that it will net assume
any responsibility for declaring war or entering into war unless the Parliament of Canada
bas decided that we should participate.•
No CanaRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
dian government ever did participate in a
war without the approval of Parliament.
Nevertheless, it is nonsense to say that the
Government would under no circumstances
enter into war until Parliament had decided
upon our participation. Suppose a war broke
out between a Far Eastern country and the
United States of America, and that the Far
Eastern countrv sought entrance te the United
States through Canada. Does the honourable
leader say that in such circumstances his
Covernment would wait to consult Parliament?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. We should
have to act then to defend Canada.
Of course.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
But that is not what my honourable friend
said a little while ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

Righît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then, according to my honourable friend, Parliament
would net necessarily be consulted in the matter of defence of Canada, but would be consulted only with respect to a war that was
taking place outside Canada. However, the
defence of Canada is not what in the first instance is going te give us trouble. What will
trouble us will be defence of the ring of
steel which surrounds us and bas surrounded
us all through our history. But here I am

JANUARY 18, 1939
only .poiftiflg out that the broad statement
of my honourable friend that we shall neyer
go ta war without first getting parliamentary
approval may flot be correct. It is conceivable that we may have to act first and get
approval afterwards.

ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And it is
conceivable that we may have to act without
being threatened by any enemy on our own
territory.
Hon. Mr. ]JANDURAND:
We ail agree
as to that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The plea of
my honourable friend is that we should flot
insist upon saying something that means something, but we should cloak our intentions
with the statement that Parliament will decide our course. I repeat that I amn not urging
that Canada shou]d take part in small wars in
which Great Britain may be engaged here,
there and everywhere. What I say is that
there is one course, on the great, broad
question of defence, which. as a matter of wise,
far-seeing policy we should pursue in our own
interests and which will best insure our freedom and security, and 1 beg of the Government to take that course.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Calder, for adjournment of the debate, was withdrawn.
The Address was adopted.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is customary for the Senate, after
having discussed and adopted the Address and
appointed committees, ta adjourn in - order
that we may not have ta await legislation from
the Commons pending conclusion of their
lengthy debates. As a resuit of that tradition
a certain number of our colleagues from the
extreme East and West defer attendance here
until we re-assemble. I commend them for
their wisdom. I feel that the debate on the
Address in the Cammons may be lengthy, and
I know that after that debate there xviii be a
discussion of the convention between Canada
and the United States, -and of the modifications
of the conventions between Canada and other
countries of the British Empire. Under the
cireumnstances I do not hesitate to suggest a
fairly lang adjournment, after which we may
stili be awaiting legislation from the Commons.
I move tbat when the House adjourns taday it do stand adjouýrned until Tuesday, the
14th of February, at 8 o'clock in the evening.

THE LATE POPE PIUS XI
TRIBUTES

TO

HIS

MEMORY

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Heneurable
senators. I deem it my duty te convey te the
Senate the message wbich the Prime Minister
of Canada and Secretary of State for Extomnai Affairs addressed te His Britannic
Majesty's Minister at Vatican City on the
occasion of the demise of His Holiness Pope
Pius XI. It reads as follows:
Ottaiva, February 10. 1939.
Will yeu kindly convey te His Excellency the
Secretary of State of the Holy See the fehlowing expression of sympathy of the Goveroment
of Canada, in the hereavement eccasioned the
Vatican City and the Roman Cathelie Church
hy the death of His Holiness Pope Pins XI.
"The Gevernment of Canada desires te
associate itself with the gevernments of other
countries in expressing its sense of the lss
sustained in the death of His Holiness Pope
Pins XI. The profond serrow felt hy incmbers of the Roman Catholie Churcb in aIl parts
of the world will be shared threugbeut Canada.
whcre the devotion of Pope Pius te the spiritual

progress of mankind had gained for His
Holiniess iiation-wide admiration and esteem."

May I. as the representatîve of the Gevernment in this Chamber, be permitted te, add
that I fimlly share the views wvhicb this
message expresses. I arn convinced that this

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
DISCUSSION
Hon. RAOUL DANDURÂND: Heneurable
senaters, I notice that His Heneur the Speaker
bias net called the Orders of the Day. The
reasen is, ef course, that he finds a blank
under that heading. Wben we separated it
was my hope that upen eur reassembling
I should be able te bring seme measures
befere this Cbamber, or that sorne weuld ho
sent over to us frem the Cemmons. I arn
disappointcd in botb respects, and I have been
wondering, and discussing with some of my
colleagues, whether we were not somewhat
too eptimistie wben we fixed upon the l4th
of February for a return te our labours.
In the circurnstances I shall cogitate witb rny
colleagues for anether day on the question of
what this Chamber sbould do.
I will flot repeat what bas so often been
said here as te the disappointment we feel at
the paucity of work whicb cernes te us in the
first weeks of a session. I weuld rather refer
my boneurable colleagues, and more especially
ilhese who are newcomers ameng us, te a very
interesting debate wbich took place bere in
the sessien of 1934, wben the late Henourable
Senator Murphy gave us a fine disquisitien
on the Senate, its pewers and usefulness.
I then referred te the situation wbich, te my
ewn knowledge, bas continued fer the hast
ferty or fifty years. The Senate bas had a
censtant grievance in being forced te mark
time fer weeks because of the dilatorinessif 1 may use that word witbout meaning te
cast any reflectien upon the Hniîse of Cernmens-rn sending legislation oer te us. I bad

FEBRUARY 14, 1939
the honour of participating in that debate.
I was sandwiched between Senator Murphy
and my right honourabie friend facing me
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), and he was
foiiowed by the honourabie senator from
Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson).
In that
debate we covered the whole ground of our
compiaints, renewed session after session since
1867. The explanatians given there are stili
the explanations which might be given to-day,
and which very likely will be given for a
number of sessions ta corne.
Before I move the adjournment, perhaps
my rigbt honourabie friend has something ta
say on this point.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: My
honourahie friend je right-not for the first
time. I have something ta say.
It is flot pleasant ta be complaining session
after session of the present Administration's
utter incapacity ta utilize a legîsiative Chamnber. Truc, it is not wholiy the fault of a
Government that they are unable to make
progress in the House of Commons in the
early weeks of a session, but the machinery
is there ta enabie them ta dispose of the
matters before themn with reasonable speed, as
ie done in other great legisiative assembiies,
and that machinery is neyer availed of. Why
it is flot is a mystery ta me. The refusai ta
avail themeelves of it is simply an evidence
of lack of -courage and lack of eripacity.
But the indictmnent daes not rest there.
Even though the biame must be shared by
another party, or by two or three, for the
slow progrees made in the Commons, it does
not follow that this House muet be idie ail
these weeks. It was flot so ta nearly the samne
extent in years gone by. The late Administration during its five years in office initiated in
this bouse a great mass of important legislation. mostiy of a non-partisan character. One
bill I was examining to-day. which took us
two sessions ta put into final form. is within
eight pages of being five hundred pages in
iength. The work on it was wholi'y done here.
But that bill, nowv the Shipping Act, ie only
one of the bills initiatcd in this Chamber. The
statutes of those five years are full of legisiation of which this House is realiy the parent,
and the drafting of that legielation stili stands
the test of time. The wark was weil done.
There is no reason et ail why this Government should flot foliow a qimilar course. No
one can suggest that this House bas flot
treated Government legisiation fairly. As I
stand in my place now. I cannot think of a
single Government measure that faîled ta pas
beeasiie of opposition in this Chamber. Notwithstanding the fect th'at since 1935 the secalled opposition in this Chamber bas been

37

aiways in the ma.iarity, and for a time nearly
double the number of senators on the
Speaker's right, 1 can recali only one bill
which was even delayed. Surely no anc witb
any fairness would suggest it was delayed for
partisan reasons. I refer ta the revisian of the
Railway Act in connection with agreed charges,
and so forth. That bill was delayed for one
session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mention another.

I should like ta

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do nat recali another.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can recail the
rejection of another bill. I mention it without the least desire ta detract from my right
hanourable friend's statement. I refer ta the
Penitentiary Bill.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGREN: I was coming
ta that, and shahl deal with it most appositely
in a minute. Meantime I will assume there
ivas oniy one piece of legisiation delayed for
a year. The reason for the delay was that a
case for it was nat presentcd. The Bill was
not defeated by a partisan majarity. In the
next session. when the case for it was presented thoroughly by Ganadian National
counsel, the vote in faveur on this side was,
I tbink, just as preponderant as the vote
for it an the other side, and the Bill was
given third reading.
1 arn informed, by the way, that notwithstanding the violent proteet made by the
Minister because the Bill did not go through
in the first year, and notwithstanding the fact
that it bas been an the Statute Book now for
almost a year. it bas not yet been calied into
effect. Why, 1 do not knaw.
AIl hegisiation bas heen sympathetically,
thoroughly and fairly treated by this House,
but year after year aur services are allowed
ta elumber for a good portion of the session.
The consequences will came this sessian just
as in past sessions: towards the end there
will be a veritable inundatian of this Chamber
with ail manner of bille, and we shahl be
expected ta shut aur eyes and put the
imprimatur of the Senate upon these measures.
If we do not, we shahl probabhy be abused
by very prominent public men. Now, I give
warning that when that inundation cames no
bill wihl be passed with my approval until
we have time ta go tbrough it thoroughly and
study it ta the beet of aur capaeity.

were with us hie would wish those questions
to be answered. I put on the Order Paper
a f ew simple questions which I am confident
the officiais of the departmnent concerned
could have answered before we prorogued.
However, no answers were forthcoming, and
the questions are dead. They are not on
the Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You can revive
them. Put themn on the Order Paper again.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Simply because
Parliament prorogued those questions died.
That is very unsatisfactory. StiiI,,if I mnust

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

that we passed the Address in reply to the
Speech fromn the Throne in, I think, twentyfour hiours, whereas the debate on this subject
in the House of Commons occupied more than
two weeks. Apart from the discussion of a
very, murderous gun, about which I know
nothing except that it bas succeeded in kiliing
time for two or three weeks in the other
Chamber, the work done by the House of
Commons has been exactly on a par with that
done in this Chamber, namely, the voting of
the Address in Reply. If the Address had been
passed in the other House within about a
week of the opening, we should possibiy have
found some legisiation before us when we came
here on the l4th of February. As I do not
foresee that any legisiation wiil reach us before
the 28th of February, I take the responsibility
of moving adjouroment of the Senate until
that date.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I arn sure there is no one here who
would not like te, fali in with the ideas of the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). We ail regret, of course,
that, on account of circumstances over which
we have no control, this Chamber h-as no
business to take up at the moment and consequently it is necessary to adjourn. But
I do not think, honourable members, that we

I arn in accord with most of what was said
yesterday by my right honourable friend the
leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen). I do net tbink anybody will accuse
me of net lýeing willing te work when there
is werk te do. If there were work for us
te do next week or the week after, I certainly
sheuld ho agreeable te a short adjournmentas short -as possible. But I arn thinking new
particularly of the position in wvhicb those of
us wbe cerne frem a long distance fiod ourselves. I can understand-and I arn net saying
this in any critical spirit whiatever-that
heneurable sonaters who live within a cernparativcly short distance of Ottawa would
net find much incenvenience in corning back
here next woek or the weok after, for a day or
twe. It is net such a simple matter fer those
of us whe live at the far ends of the country
te keep geing back and forth betwt:en this
city and our places of residonce and business.
We triod te arrange our affairs and beave
thern in as gond erder as possible before we
came bore on the l2tb of January, in respense te His Excelloncy's summens te do the
business of the people, for wbicb we were
appointed. We found, as the honourable
leader of the Government lias said. that after
adopting the Address in Reply te the Spieech
frern the Throne, as we did after two days of
debate, ive had nothing else te do, and an
adjeurnment becarne neoessary on the lSth ef
January. I arn net critieizing the Government or anybody for the failuro te initiate
in the Sonate bogislation which perhaps could
have boon handled as well boere as in the
other Chamber; I arn simply relating the fact.
W'hen tlîe Sonate adjourned we returned te
our homes. These of us who had been away
since the 10th or l2th of J-anuary endeavoured
te pick up the threads of our business as we
bad left thern.
As honourable members knew. a week in
Ottawa is net very long; neither is a fortnight.
I arn very rnuch afraid that if we adjourn
fer enly two weeks wo shahl ho in exaetlY the
same position when we return bore as wve
are in to-day. Let us face conditions as thiey
exist. As I have already said, I arn willing
te cerne back as soon as there is anvthing for
us te do. but I do net think it is fair te, ask
us. especially thoseoef us wbe live at a long
distance, te cerne back twe weeks frorn now,
when it dees appear that there wiIl ho ne
business waiting for us even then. I arn net
blaming the leader of the Gevernment nor
the Government thernselves for this, for arn I
roferring te the situation as a defeet of our
democratic system, in wbieh I arn a strong
believer. I am simply tr *ving te state the
fact as 1 -,0e it, and I Say that unless there is
ITon. Nir. DUFF.

a reasonable prospect that frorn the 28th of
February we shall have enough business befere
us to keep us busy until the end of the
session, the adjournrnent should be extcnded
beyond the 28th.
What does an adjournment mean te bonourahle members who live on the Pacifie coast,
for instance? It takes a week for them to get
home frorn here. Perhaps 1 arn speaking out
of turn. for undoubtedly honourable senators
from the Pacifie coast are better able to discuss their problems thao 1 arn.
Naturally,
I arn more farniliar with the situation in the
Maritime Provinces. However, I may point
eut that it takes those honourable gentlemen
a week to go home and a wook to corne back
here. Consequoý,ntly if wo adjourn until the
28th instant they will have to romain in Ottawa
and1 twiddle their thurnbs during the intorval.
The sarnc objection to a two-week adjouranient applies with respect te honourable senators from the Maritimes. For instance, it
takes me three days te get home, and of
course an equal tirne to return bore. I require

appreciate, this means only three days are
left before 1 have to make arrangements to
rcturn te Ottawa. I have net the slightest
objection te the proposed adjournment if on
my roture here there will be sufficient business in the Senate te warrant this stop; but
1 verv rnuch deubt whether there will be anything then te occupy our time.
Yesterday afternoon, at about the same tirne
as the right honourable leader opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) was on bis foot, the Prime
Ministor was endeavouring to expedite business in the other Chamber. I do net tbink
hoe was dictatorial, but bie gave notice that,
coormencing to-day, Government
business
should have procedence over private members'
resolutions. That, te rny mmnd, shows the
Prime Minister and the Government are eager
te procoed with the business of the country.
On the other hand, I de net tbink the propesal is altegether fair te the private members
whe may wisb te dîscuss certain matters on
Wednosdays.
Whatever we do we are certain te ho
criticized, but from rny fairly long experionce
in theoether Chamber and my short terni of
service bore. I would nover besitate te declare
in my censtituency that the Sonate is a werthwhlle Chamber and its members are ready,
indeed oager, te work whenex or there is work
te do. I repeat. I do net think the proposed
adjeurnrnent will serve the purpese intended.
As my bonourable leader is aware, the Prime
Minister rneved yesterday in the Commons
for approval ef the trade agreement with the

FEBRUARY 15, 1939
United States.
The debate was adjourned
until Friday. This is a very important treaty,
and it is very unlikely that it will be disposed
of within a fortnight. The debate may extend
over tbree weeks. and until its conclusion.
obviously, no Government legislation can be
ready for submission to this Chamber. I arn
confident that the business and professional
members of the Senate, men with a stake in
the country, would be much better employed
in their constituencies, endeavouring to do
sornctbing for flie people of Canada. In the
circumstances I would impress on the honourable leader of the Goverument that a fortnight's adjournment would be ineffective; that
on returning here at the end of the month we
sbould be no further forward than we are
to-day. Therefore 1 respectfully suggest that
he amend bis proposed motion by extending
the adjournment to the 7th day of March.
Righf Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, tbere is a feature of the
situation which, no matter how often one
repeats it. does not seem f0 be understood
outside this House.
Certainly the senator
who bas just sat down understands it j.ust
as well as the rest of us. There seemns to be
an impression abroad that we can work here
only wben business cornes to us tbat bas
been comp]etely deait with in the other Huse.
I thougbt, yesterday that wbat I said would
be plain, but apparently it is not. The Senate is as capable of initiating legisiaf ion as
tbe Commons, and tbe Government are equally
free in botb bouses. There is, of course, a
distinction, but it pertains to so srnall a
volume of legislation as to be almost negligible: bis involving a cbarge on the treasury
must be introduced in the bouse of Commons by resolution approved by His Excellency. This bouse recognizes that distinction
wbetber it exists in law or not. But, speaking
broadly, one Chamber is as open as the otber
for tbe initiation of bis and tbe first deliberation and decision upon tbem.
If you look tbrougb tbe Speech from tbe
Throne, foresbadowing wbat we are to deal
wvitb at tbis session. you can find several items
wbicb tbe Government could very well introduce in tbe Senate. I do not like to particularize; it is not for one bere to dictate tbe
specific course of any bill; but certainly you
can find in the first column of page 2 one
item, and in the second column of the same
page two items, whieb could be just as
appropriately dealt witb bere. Wby tbey are
not I arn at a loss to understand. Surely it
is tbe business of tbe Administration f0 get
the best value out of botb Houses of Parliament. To fail to do so is to fail ini tbe
function of government.

I arn not complaining now, nor did 1 intend
last nigbt to complain, of tbe lengtb of debates in the Commons. In tbat regard I arn
pretty much of the same feeling as the bonourable senator from Lunenburg (bon. Mr.
Duif). Tbe House of Gommons is tbe meiting pot of tbe nation. Tbere must be in tbat
Cbamber a latitude for debate wbicb we do
not require bere. Tbere East meets West,
race meets race, class meets class, and alI get
a better understanding of the difficulties of
our country from listening to one another's
views.
Tbougb tbe macbinery f0 expedite legislation is available, I agree it would be a mnistake to apply it f oo rigidly or too frequently.
I bave said, and 1 do flot retract my statement. that a moderate use of tbat macbinery
would be advisable. If one reads tbe debates
uf any legislature in a demnocratic country
wbere multiplicity of business renders it necessary tbat discussion be severely restrictedif in particular one reads tbe debates of the
British House of Commons, in wbicb, I think,
the average intelligence will not be found to
be very mucb bigber than bere-one cannot
but be impressed witb tbe fact tbat the level
of debate is above tbat of our Commons.
Why is it so? It is because tbere tbey bave
only so mucb time at tbeir disposaI and eacb
member is bitting bis nail on the bead witb
every sentence. Tbat may be an exaggeration to a degree, but it epitomizes tbe difference between tbe debates of a bouse in whicb
business must be regularized in order tbat
ifs enormous volume may 'be bandled. and
tbe debates of a legislature in wbicb there
is unlimited time for ahl sorts of wvaste of the
people's money.
I ask bonourable members to spend a littie
time reading the debates that occur in the
House of Representatives at Washington after
tbe time limit applies, wben tbe severest
restrictions are imposed, and to compare tbem
witb the debates for whicb no time limit is
set. I fuel certain you will agree with me that
tbe advantage is wbolly on the side of speeches
delivered wben only so many minutes are
allowed and tbe Congressmen speaking bave
to make tbe most effective use of every sentence and every moment of time. We sbould
gain if some measure of sucb restriction were
applied in the Parliament of Canada.
But let us set aside the lack of restriction on
debate and grant tbat the members of the
Commons may talk to their hearts' content.
We are still witbout an answer f0 tbe cbief
indictmnent, namely. that the Government fail
to introduce a large portion of their legisiation in this House. We shahl neyer get the fuil

RFVISED EDITION

SENATE
value of either House unless this is done. We
shahl have tbis session just a epetition of what
we bave had nearly always: the clogging of
legislative machinery at the end, the same
shameful passing of legislation by the meme
putting of a stamp upon it simply because
we could do nothing else within the limited
time. For this condition the Government are
responsible, and they cannot escape their
responsibility. Ministers like to expatiate on
the importance of the bis they are introducing and what their departmnents are doing.
That is ail righit. I guess one is as vain as
another in that regard. But it doca not excuse
the failure of the Government to utilize the
time of honourabie members of this Housetime that is realiy paid for and is the property
of the country-and therehy get a systemnatie,
thorough-going and worth-while study of the
legisiation that passes the Parliament of
Canada. Again I would impress upon the
Government the necessity of doing this. We
cannot expeet the people of this country to
tolerate tie disposition that we are compelled
to make, in the circumstances forced upon us,
of the business that is ours. I know what I
should be saying were I outside. Ahl one can
do in tie clutci of circunistancc is to make
very clear where the responsibility lies, and
that I hiope I have done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right hionourable friend has not answered the prayer
of the honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif).
Right Hon. Mm. MEIGHEN: I amn in agreement with the honoumable leader of the House,
and unless I amn in disagreement I say very
little. I do not like the idea of adjourning
longer. I appmeciate tie fact tiat I can get
here overnight, wiereas the journey takes
members from British Columbia eight days,
and members from the Maritimes a somewhat
siorter time. But it is not unreasonable to
hope tiat the Governiment wiil sec the error
of theim ways. Thcre are some men of perspicacity and intelligence there; no one admits
that more freehx' than I do. Nor is it entirely
irrational to expect that the Commons will
get thmougi debate on the trade treaty wîth
the United States in less than three weeks'
time.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourahke mcmbers, may I make a sueggestion? The Senate
bas done excellent work in past years, and
never to better purpose than in its codification
of certain laws. Similar work is about to come
before Parliament with respect to the Small
Loan Companies Bill. Tic Senate spent weeks
and weeks perfecting that legislation and
knocking it into pretty gond shape. Why could
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

flot the honourable leader of this buse make
an effort to bring this proposed legislation
again before us? As 1 have indicated, we
have done most of the work. Many experts
appeared before us and gave their advice, and
we were at great pains to turn out a workable piece of legisiation. In ail probability the
Commons will again tackle that legislation at
tbe end of the session and send it over to us,
but certainly in no better shape than we could
put that measure if it were placed in our hands
wvhen we return here after the proposed adj ournment.
Hon. R. H1. POPE: Honourable members, I
think we should procecd more rapidly than
we are doing. However, you know who is the
Prime Minister of Canada. You know his
name. He has a good name, a nice name. But
you do flot knoxv more about him than I do.
I knewv imi almost as soon as lie was humn.
I think the first public position he ever occupiedl was that of Deputy Minister of Labour,
and 1 kncev him long befome that. Now, he
told the people of Canada that if he came to
power lie would abolish the Senate. If he
does not intend to give us any work to do,
w'hy dloes lie flot abolish the Senate? That is
wh'at I want to knowv.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: I confess that I
cannot answer with certainty the question put
by mny hionourable friend to my ighit (Hon.
Mr. Duif) . I cannot bc sure that there will
be legislation for this Chainher to deal with
on the 28th of Februamy. But, of course, a
dlate must be fixcd. I am in the hands of the
Senate as to whether it shall be the 28th of
Febmuary or the 7th of Mardli; but inasmuch
as my ight honourable friend (Rigit Hon.
Mr. Meighen), representing, I suppose, tie
wisdom of the other side, bas agreed that our
second adjournment should not go beyond the
28th of Febmuamy, I would asIc tic honourable
scnator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)
not to insist at this time. If I see tiat there
is nothing coming to us on tic 28th I will
wixre him to remain at home for a few days
more.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not think the right
bonourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meigbien) laid down tic dictumn that we
siould meet on the 28th. AIl tiat he seemed
to be worried about-and quite properly sowas the fact that tbis House should have more
business to do, and that part of the business
of Parliament should be introduced in this
Chamber, so that when we are summoned heme
at tie beginning of the session we may pmoceed
wjth the business of the country instead of
adjourning. I agree with my righit honoumable
friend in that, if it is possible. However,

43

FEBRUARY 15, 1939
during tbe twenty or twenty-one years I have
been in Parliarnent every government bas
been of opinion-and I presume that they were
within their rigbts--tbat most of the legisiation should be introduced in the other Chamber. So I ar n ot criticizing the Government.
Witb regard to the motion now before the
House, it seems to me that the question is
flot so much whiether the Governrnent bas
sent us business or not, as whether, if we meet
again on the 28th of February, we shall be
any furtber abead than we are to-day. That
is the whiole point.
My honourable friend tbe leader of the
Government bas said that if we adjourn to
the 28th and there is then no business to be
done be will send me a wire. That is very
kind of bîm, but 1 would suggest tbat if tbere
is no reasonable certainty that we shall bave
something to do by the 28th of February or
until the 6th of March, tbere is no reason wby
tbe members of this Cbamber sbould corne
bere on the 28tb, for they would likely bave
eitber to rernain bere in Ottawa during another
adjournment or else return borne for a few
days and corne back bere again a few days
later. If there is no business on tbe 28tb we
sball be in exactly the saine position that we
are in now. I arn speaking of this strictly as
a business matter. If tbere is work. to be
done here I will stay, but I do flot want to
remain bere twiddling rny tburnbs and kicking my heels against tbe desk, and perbaps
getting into some miscbief.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Tbis is too serious a matter
to joke about. I do flot mmnd the criticism
of sorne people outside, because, after ail,
many of them are flot wortb worrying about.
Most of the people of tbis country realize the
value of this Chamber. When I go borne on
Friday or Saturday and arn seen walking tbe
streets of Lunenburg it will be known tbat
there is sorne good reason for rny absence frorn
Ottawa. Therefore I appeal again to the right
honourable the leader of the opposition (Rigbt
Hon. Mr. Meigýhen), who admits that bie can
go home overnight, and to honourable members from Montreal, who are in a similar position. Those of us wbo bave to travel long
distances are put to great expense in making
unnecessary trips. If it can be sbown to, me
that the debate on the treaty in the other'
House will be brougbt to a conclusion next
week, or tbat the Government are going to
send us some business, tben, 1 say, ]et us stay
bere and ge.t on with the business of tbe
country; otberwise I appeal to rny honourable
frîend, the good-looking gentleman with the
cbarming smile (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), wbo
is a business man, to accept my suggestion
71498-4j

tbat we sbould adjoura until the l4th of
March, or, if be is insistent, I would ask birn
to cornpromise and make it tbe 7th of March.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I bave been bere
for many years, and wben we bave been taking
short adjournments I have always sympathized
witb bonourable gentlemen frorn the eastern
and western extremities of Canada. I bave
realized that those of us who live within one
bundred or one bundred and flfty miles of
Ottawa may at tirnes have seemed egotistical.
In the circumstances I will accept the compromise offered, and will say tbe 7th of March
at 8 o'clock. I would add onIy this. We
shall then bave before us most of tbe rnonth
of March, the rnonth of April, and perhaps
fifteen days of May, before the adjournment
for the reception of Tbeir Majesties. I arn
convinced that after that we shaîl l bere
for several more weeks. I bave no doubt,
however, that in two or two and a half montbs
this flouse can do the work that it takes the
buse of Commons five months to accomplisb.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the bonourable member leave to amend bis motion to

That when the Senate adjourna to-day it do

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS AND
MONTREAL TERMINAL
INQUI11Y

Hon. Mr. BLACK inquired of the Government:
1. What is the total deficit, if any, on the
Canadian National Railways for the first nine
months of the current fiscal year?
2. Is the report correct which appeared in
the press of Canada to the effect that the
Canadian National Railways is to spend twelve
million dollars or more on a new passenger
terminal in the city of Montreal?
3. If so, is the proposed expenditure approved
by the Government, and from what source
is the money to be provided for such expenditurc?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
To this inquiry
I have the following answers:
1. The Canadian National Railways' accounts for the calendar year, in which are included the figures for the first nine months
of the Government fiscal year, will not be
available until approved by the Government
auditors. Approval is expected on or about
the 15th of March next.
2. Yes.
3. The proposed expenditure will be made
under the provisions of Chapter 12, 19-20
George V, section 3, but the Federal Government will contribute in part from funds voted
by Parliament in its construction and rehabilitation appropriation for the current fiscal
year.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: With the leave of the

that at the next sitting of the House I shall

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:

was situated, to be part of Confederation Park?
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

I was going to suggest. There was some
objection to this Bill in its original form, and
I ar n ot certain whether that objection
carnies on to the Bill in its present form or
flot. If it does, I wouid suggest that the

that it migbt be gone over a .first time. I
think the Bill in the main is ail right, though

THE LATE SENATOR SPENCE
TRIBUTE

TO RIIS MEMORY

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I rise to inforrn the Senate officially
of the deinise of one of our colleagues, the
Honourable Mr. Spence, who was with us
when we separated some tbree weeks ago.
I did not know my honourable colleague
the senator from Toronto very intimately,
the reason being tbat sbortly after he entered
this House an ailment prevented him from
playing an active roie in our Chamber. Senaton Spence constantly expressed a desire to
do bhis part in t.he work of any cornmittee
to which he migbt be called, and 1 have often
had visits from hlm during which he told
me he was very eager to performn bis duties
as a senator, even tbougb be feit the grip
of disease upon him.
Tbe late Senator Spence bad had a very
interesting careen at the Dar in Toronto, and
was one of the iigbts of the Bar of Ontario.
He bad always shown considerable public
spirit. Tbere are those who are wont to
speak sornewhat flippa.ntly of "politicians."
They meau, of course, tbose men who are
interested in public if e and who devote considerable time to the study of polities,
economics and other matters of interest to
the State as a whohe. It is said tbat wben
we die tbe terra "politicians" is dnopped, and
that we pass on to the higber stage of statesmanship.
Senator Spence was a devoted citizen. He
interested bimself in the affairs of the country, and once or twice was a candidate for
election. in Ontario, 'but be neyer reached the
Unfortunately, when
House of Commons.
he came bere he could not give us the full
benefit of his experience and knowiedge. I
have received from bis family a letter thanking the Senate for flowers sent to bis funeral,
and stating that from the moment of bis
appointment to the Senate bis life was devoted to this House and to public affairs in
genenal. I desire, in tbe name of the Senate,
to express to his family our deep regret at
his departure.

SENATE
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
It
was with deep regret that his numerous friends
learned of the death of Senator Spence. In
Toronto he was indeed well known. His life
was pretty much an epitome of the lives of
many successful Canadians; lives of ambition
rewarded by success. He came from one of
our western Ontario rural points. passed
through our schools, graduated in law, became a student in a law firm and rose to
be himself head of a firm of considerable
dimensions, took a modest but active interest
in public affairs, entered this House, and
throughout bis career succeeded in making
very many his friends and made none his foes.
He was rewarded as well by a happy domestic
life. and leaves a family which is a great credit
to him.
I join with the leader of the House in expressing the regret of all at his departure,
and our sympathy with the members of his
family.
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
senators. as I happen to have been a personal friend of the late Senator Spence over
a long period of years. may I be permittedto include a word? He was born and raised
in virtually the same neighbourhood as I was.
His parents were immigrants from the Orkney
Islands and, like a great many people who
settled in the same part of Brute county,
knew more about sailing and fishing than
they did about farming. Mr. Spence. when
a youth, was never afraid of a day's work,
and he went out on a farim and put in liard
work with his hands to earn the money
which enabled him to attend Walkerton high
school and get a teacher's certificate. After
getting this certificate be never failed to put
in industrious weeks each summer earning a
little more money. He was always on hand
when work was offering. and wherever he
went he made friends bv doing in a satisfactory fashion the things he undcrtook.
His people came from a section of Scotland where educaiion is highly prized, and
so be determoined to get an education for
himself. He passed his ideal on to his family,
every member of which is an honour graduate
of a university and engaged in a very useful
occupation at the present time.
Jim Spence was a man of his word, a man
of courage, a man of character and ability,
and when be undertook to do a thing be saw
it through. His friends will remember him,
his household and his bospitality for a great
many years to come.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

CANADA'S

RAILWAY

PROBLEM

MOTION

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN rose to move the
following resolution:
That, with a view to completing the inquiry
pursued during last session by the Special Railway Committee of this House and preparing
and submitting an adequate report on such
inquiry, this Special Committee be reappointed
to inquire into and report upon the best means
of relieving the country from its extremely
serious railway condition and financial burden
consequent thereto, with power to send for
persons, papers and records, and that the said
Committee be reappointed w-ith the same personnel, and, therefore, that it consist of
Senators Beaubien, Blaek, Buchanan, Calder,
Cantley, Côté, Dandurand, Graham, Haig,
Hugessen, Horsey, Jones. Hardy, M\icRae,
Meighen, Murdock, Parent, Robinson, Sharpe
and Sinclair.
He said: Honourable senators, to correlat'
my present resolution with the work done by
the Special Committee on Railways last year.
I want to state at the outset that this resoluion is couched in almost exactly the samne
terns as the motion made last session for
the purpose of having that special committee
The personnel is the samie, the
appointe(.
purpose is the same and the coummittee's
powers are the same.
Iu order to pick up the thread of the comiiiitee's

work where

we left

it last year,

I

thibnk it would be advisable to refresh our
memories by referring. if only briefly, to the
interim report made by the committee just
before prorogation. It read in part as follows:
The evidence before the comnittee was not
completed umtil very shortly before prorogation
and consequently the comimittee has been unable,
througb lack of time, to analyse the vast mass
of material before it in such mianner as to
enable it to present a report either satisfactory
to itself or valuable to the publie. The proceedings before the committee and the publicity
given thereto must have contributed greatly to
the information of all interested and should be
of inestimable value in the further consideration
of the problem by the Government and people
of this country.
Having regard to the desirability of complet-

ing the inquiry, and to the preservation of the
value of the exanination already made, and the
preparation of an adequate report thereon, the
committee recommîends that it be reappointed
early in the next session of Parliament. The
intention is that a thorough review shall be
made of all evidence and other inaterial already
at the disposai of the committee, and a report
tiereon presented to Parliament.
The committee may deem it advisable, when
later convened, to obtain further data bearing
upon the general problem and its possible
solution.
This report was presented to the House and
unanimously approved. In speaking on the
report the honourable leader of the Senate

MARCH 7. 1939
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) oxpressed himEe1f as
follows:
The committee may decide that certain parts
of the evidence shouid be tested by outside
engineers and accountants. But in that event
the committeo would have to iay down anme
genoral lines along which the specialiats should
work. It is expeeted that Parliaineiit will
prorogue before midnight. This railway matter
is an invoivod that I have serjous doubts as
to the possibiiity of nur framing, in the short
time nnw at our disposai, a basia upon which
examination by experts should proceed. Besides,
though the comniittee took conaiderabie evidence,
it may be found necesaary to aupplement this
next session. These are reasons why I feel
we ahouid abstain f romn suggesting to the Goverrnient at thia stage the appointinent of outside engineera and accounitants to continue the
work atartod by our committee-for that is
what the sugiestion would mneau. I think it
is necessary tl at we shouid pursue our study
of the raiiway problein next session. in order to
do justice to ourseivea and the Sonate as a
whole, and I hope the committee will he
reappointed.
A few weeks ago, just 'before our last
adjournnîoent, the right honourable leader on
this side of the House (Right Hon. Mr'.
Moighen) very strongly recommondod the
In so
reappointmcnt of that cnmmittee.
doing he called attention te, the fact that the
revenues of the country had heen greatly
reduced during the course of last year, and
that unfortunatoly the deficit of the Canadian
National Railways had been very largely
increased. That is not a pleasant retrospect.
but what of the days that lie ahead of us?
Unempînyment relief is still a heavy burden.
Aithougx there bas been a rediiction in the
number of idle bands, we are still spending
$100,000,000 a year on unempinyment relief.
I
That means S900.000.000 in fine years.
understand that the Govorninent now purpose
replacing relief to somne extent by puýblic
works, contributing to thein in the proportion
of forty to fifty per cent of their cost. I
consider tbat the intention to do away witb
relief is a very estimable one, for in my
opinion relief is eating very deeply into the
mor-al fabric of our population. But we must'
flot forget that in order to bring about equal
results in the subsistence of our people who
are now unemployed, public works wili cnst
infinitely more than relief. And, to carry thein
out, large amouints will have to be found.
Indeod, the Minister statod not long ago that
these publie works would be on a very large
scale, and this has been intorproted by the
press in many parts of the country as being
in tho neighbnurhond of 3100,000,000.
The country bas to meot a heavy ioss on
the purchase of Western wheat. The extent
of that loas will not be ascertained, 1 understand, until the beginning of August, but we

49

know that it will be very substantial. Then,
I understand, the Minister of Agriculture
wants 'to inaugurate a per-acre allowance.
What amount wili 'be required for that I do
flot know, but evidentiy it will be great; and
this too will have to be found.
Our expenditure on defence has grown from
$35,'000,000 to W6,000,000, which sum also will
have to be forthcoming. This growth marks
in a very striking way, it seems to me, the
degree of the nation's anxiety. It could hardly
be otherwise, after the hectic days that we
have lived during the last year. We have
lived and are, after ail, stili living under the
menace of perhaps undeclared, but swift and
murderous war.
Finally, we have the Canadian National
Railways, which again this year show a loss
of $100,000,000. Whatever people may state,
it is $100.000,000-848,000,000 in interest alone
on the country's investment in that unfortunate venture, and 352,000,000 shortage in
the interest due to the public. Furthermore,
the Canadian National now intend to spend
$12,500.000 on their terminaIs at Montreal.
No doubt, as frequently has been the case in
work of that kind, this will prove to be very
much more expensive when completed than it
seemed when proposed. Year after year the
officers of the Canadian National Railways
have told us that the system was on the ove
of showing an operating surplus, but each
annual report bas disclosed a deficit. And the
current deficit, like the deficits of previous
years, will have to be met by the country.
Evidently we are heading for a year of
untold expenditure-I might say of untold
extravagance. Where wilI the money be found?
Either by taxation or by borrowing, which
is virtually the saine thing in the long run.
This means that ail the people, rich and
pour alike, will have to bear a greater and
more irksome burden of taxation. It means
also that the wheels of business will be still
further retarded and the much hop2d-for
day of prosperity still longer postponed. Conditions are far worse this year than they were
last, and if the Sonate had gond reason then,
in seeking retrenchinent and ecnnomy, t&
invostigate this vicinus probloin thoroughly.
it has far more reason to complete its work
this year. There is no doubt that the investigation was received very favourably
throughout the country, for our people feel
that the transportation problem is the most
difficult of the probleins confronting us. After
alI, conditions abroad as well as in Canada
might tend to, remedy our relief and our
wheat troubles, and might evon bring about a
substantial reduction in our defence expenditure: but what can favourably affect our

50

SENATE

railway problem? For the last seventeen years,
with but two exceptions, the Canadian National results have been disheartening, and
the increasing deficits have now reached the
point where financial calamity threatens.
Honourable senators, no doubt the public
was satisfied to see the Senate address itself
to this problem, for it felt that as a malignant cancer it must be studied with almost
clinical care, and treated with absolute impartiality. If the public was somewhat disappointed with the interim report of the committee, it must have realized that in the
circumstances anything else was impossible,
and I am certain it was heartened by the
promise that the Senate would complete the
work this year. Now we are face to face with
that promise. The public trusts the Senatehas faith in our promise. We have already
gathered together a wealth of information
from the highest and most capable authorities
in the railway art. We have complained, and
with reason, that the Government have given
us nothing to do, but now we have work of
our own to perform, and it seems to me that
we cannot do otherwise than resume our investigation, comiplete it, and draw therefrom
such conclusions as may be justified. If I
may borrow again the words of the honourable
leader of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
I would say that at the present moment, face
to face with our promise and with the work
already done, we owe it to the Senate and to
ourselves to continue our efforts of last session
and bring them to a proper conclusion.
With these few remarks, I move the motion
in my name.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I must confess that I am somewhat
perplexed as to the task which will confront
the committee to be appointed, and my
perplexity arises from conditions familiar to
everyone in this Chamber. When, last session,
at the request of my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), we discussed the advisability
of appointing a committee, we were reminded
of Sir Edward Beatty's suggestion for unified
management. I then stated the Government's
policy and read the programme of the Liberal
party as laid before the people in the elections
of the autumn of 1935. On the railway question there was this pronouncement: The
Liberal party stands for the maintenance of
the integrity of the Canadian National Railway as a publicly-owned and publicly-controlled service.
I realized then, and do now, that, as a
Minister of the Crown, I am jointly responsible in this Chamber for the policy of the
Government of the day. That responsibility
is personal to myself; the Senate is a free
Hon. Mr. BEAUBTEN.

agent and can propound its own views and
even express its own policies as it deems fit.
Last session a committee was appointed and
studied co-operation as laid down by the Act
of 1933, which my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) sponsored in this
Chamber. The committee also studied unified
management as suggested by Sir Edward
Beatty. It went into the matter thoroughly at
some thirty meetings or more, and heard
experts from the two great railway systems.
To-day the situation is somewhat altered.
Now we have before us the railway policy of
the Conservative party as expressed at the
convention of July last.
I believe that
convention was attended by most of the
honourable members of this Chamber who
stand by Conservative principles. There a
resolution was adopted unanimously-and I
think I am citing it textually-in opposition
to any plan of unification or amalgamation
of the two great railways of Canada, and to
any form of monopoly of railway transport,
either private or public. If my honourable
friends facing me still adhere to those views,
I feel that the work of the committee will
be somewhat limited as compared with the
ground covered last session, for it will be
limited mostly to co-operation under the Act
of 1933, which apparently the two great parties
still favour. Last session when the committee
ended its labours Sir Edward Beatty made a
suggestion. He felt that we might perhaps be
lost in the formidable and contradictory mass
of figures produced, and so be suggested that
we aslk the Government to appoint high-class
railway experts to test those figures and
ascertain their respective values.
I may say that since that matter came
before us, both in the committee and in this
Chamber, I have brought it to the attention
of the Government. The Government are
averse to appointing such a group of railway
experts, for several reasons, the most important
being that it would imply a readiness on the
Government's part to change their policy of
co-operation to a policy of unification or
amalgamation.
My honourable friend has
mentioned once or twice that the public is
expecting the Senate to do the right thing by
the country. We are not the directly elected
representatives of the people. This important
condition must be faced, that to-day there is
in the House of Commons what I may term
unanimity against the principle of unified
management, or amalgamation of any kind.
I have just read the resolution unanimously
passed by the convention of the Conservative
party. Its leader has been up and down the
country declaring his hostility to unification
or amalgamation. We are therefore back to
the Act of the Bennett Government of 1933,

MARCH 7, 1939
which directs the two railways to eliminate
competition to as great an extent as possible,
yet not to the point of amalgamation.
I know the difficulty we shall have in committee between the respective supporters of
co-operation and of competition. Last year
we discussed these two points of view for
weeks and weeks. Undoubtedly the ills of the
Canadian Pacifie are grave and need very
careful consideration, but the company must
face the situation that public opinion as
represented in the House of Commons, for
the time being at all events, is against
amalgamation or unification. The executives
of the two railway companies know very well
what can be done to improve their respective
conditions, and apparently the only deterrent
to closer co-operation is the fear that some
concession by one company may be to its
detriment and to the advantage of the other
company; that there will be no quid pro
quo. If the two executives would get together
and make a careful study of what should and
could be donc, substantial results would doubtless ensue.
That is the situation which now faces us.
I have no objection to the motion of my
honourable friend. The committee may be
able to give useful advice to the two railway
companies for the solution of their troubles.
One thing struck me during the concluding
days of last session, and I mentioned it to
some of my friends on the other side. We
did not explore the question of obtaining
from the Canadian National Railway management details as to all the productive and
all the unproductive mileage, so that we
might have a general view of the Canadian
National system throughout the Dominion.
There is another matter, also of very considerable import, which we could examine,
and which would call for an amendment
to the Act of 1903. It is a matter which was
but incidentally mentioned in the Act, concerning the unemployment resulting from
alterations in the whole system. It would be
for us to try to see if we could not induce
the Government to examine into the question
of sharing with the Canadian National and
the Canadian Pacifie Railway in compensating
the employees laid off. If the two railways
get together seriously, with a will to succeed
and to improve their own conditions, there
will undoubtedly be thousands of employees
laid off, because practically eighty per cent
of the economies are represented by the
sacrifice of labour.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Fifty per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Weil, fifty per
cent.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, nonsense!

51

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course I was
looking to my friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock). There was in Washington, in
1936, I think, a meeting of the carriers and
the employees for the purpose of trying to
alleviate the situation of laid-off employees,
and a solution was reached which I believe was
satisfactory to both sides. But it strikes me
that if something is done which would result
in the laying off of a large number of employees, the Government would be interested
in seeing that they did not fall back on the
State for relief.
These are some of the questions we might
discuss in the committee. I do not know to
what extent we shall reopen our inquiry.
That will be for the committee to decide.
We had completed our inquiry on certain
lines. We may now reopen certain features.
My honourable friend has mentioned in
his remarks the $12,000,000 that will be spent
for the terminais at Montreal. I was absent
from the country some three months when
I heard what had been decided, and I confess
that I knew nothing about the question. It
had not come before me. Since then I have
taken the trouble to examine into the situation, and, unless I receive better light in the
committee I shall remain convinced that the
erection of that terminal is one of the important things to be done. I will ask no one in
the Senate to accept my dictum; I am not
an expert; but from the data I have had I am
convinced that the thing has to be donc. Of
course I know that Sir Edward Beatty is
dissatisfied. He wanted the Windsor station
to be the terminal. I am told it is absolute
nonsense to think of it as a union station.
Hon. Mr. COTE: That is not what we
were told by the witnesses last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question
was not stressed.
We can ask the Canadian National and the
Canadian Pacifie what they have done since
the 1st of July in the way of co-operation.
We want full liglit upon the administration
of the Canadian National, but we want for
our own railway a certain measure of fair
play. They have not raised their voices,
but we know the Publicity Bureau of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway and Sir Edward
Beatty are constantly on the job and constantly stressing the fact that the Canadian
National is losing large sums of money. I
think the Canadian Pacifie Railway representatives would appear in a better light if
they were candid about their campaign and
spoke of their own needs. We shall discuss
these matters when we go into committee. I
simply raise my voice now to say that a

constant campaign. an organized campaign,
hias been carried on against t.he Canadian National with a view to bringing about unifled
management. The idea of Sir Edward Beatty
is a common partnership with the Canadian
National under one form or another, and the
form ho has selected is unifled management.
WVell, the public, represented by the House
of Commons, lias said, 'No." The Sonate en
say, "Ye," but at the samne time, I think,
we shall have to take note of the fact that
wliatever comes from this Chambor will reach
the other Chamber, which will hav e to express
its opinion upon our decisions.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Would the honourable gentleman permit a question? Has there
been any ar-rangement made, or any policy
enunciated. uinder whichi more money is to
ho spont on the terminais in Montreai?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

and the resiilt of the expenditure is lying
there unproductive.

that people are afraid to invest in new enterprises, and it attributes that fear te, prognosticatieus of xvoeful prophets that we are

prognosticatieus of prophets that do the harm

at all. The harm is being done by actual
facts bearing down on men of enterprise and
units of enterprise,-the actual facts of taxes,
with Government officials filling up offices and
trying to extract every cent they can; the
danger of more officials and more taxes; the
piling up of deficits which can result only in
additional taxes or in what is worse-inflation.
These things take away every incentive to
industry and effort; these are the deadening
weights bearing down upon industry; these
are the causes of our unemployment. To
fiddle away trying to help this fellow who is
out and that fellow who is out, to keep on
spending millions more, such as $50,000,000
on railways-$60,000,000 it will be this year
$50,000,000 on wheat, and $80,000,000
-and
on pensions, much of which pension burden
we never should have got under at all-to
keep on doing these things does not help and
cannot lead to any destiny except more unemployment, and, in the end, collapse. There
never was driving in on Parliament a duty
more trenchant or more fateful than that
of finding some way out of this railway
impasse. Let us not be affected by the
prospect of an election occurring this year or
next year or whenever it may be. Elections
in their effect on the extravagances of government have been the greatest curse this
country ever suffered. Surely it is for the
Senate to find a way and point it out. Even
if we cannot succeed in having our plan
adopted, we shall at least be able to say
that we have done our part.

that has arisen in the unification skyline or
firmament since we prorogued on the first
day of July last? I have received, as I am
sure all other honourable senators have, a
great amount of correspondence relating to our
railways, published by the Citizens' Group for
Railway Action, 611 Temple Building, Toronto,
Ontario. I believe we have all been deluged
with these papers. Yesterday there came to
me some more samples, together with a little
typewritten note from some timid soul who,
without signing his name, said:
My dear Senator,
Who finances this gigantic conspiracy to ruin
the Canadian National Railway enterprise, the
property of the people of Canada?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, agreed to
it with words that damn it very severely.

I do not necessarily subscribe to that particular language, but I think this committee,
which my honourable friend has indicated by
motion he wants reappointéd now, should
send for persons, papers and records to ascertain whence comes this statement from the
Citizens' Group. I could quote you some
things here-I am not going to do it-from
their printed records, which could be proved
absolutely untrue. Who is putting up the
money for this? Whence come the funds
for carrying on this campaign? It is a campaign in favour of what? In favour of settling
the railway problem. How? By unification
that will guarantee to the holders of certain
railroad securities the dividends that they have.
enjoyed for so many years. By all means
let us get down to business with this committee, send for persons, papers and records
in connection with this Citizens' Group, and
ascertain from where comes the support that
enables them to be one of the best customers
that the Canadian Post Office Department
has had during the last few months. We
should get some facts on why they are doing
this and who is paying the shot.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I rise to state that I am h-eartily in
accord with the motion of the honourable
senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). I
think this committee should again be convened to go into, and secure if possible some
conclusions upon, the enormous amount of
evidence that was placed before the committee at the last session of Parliament. I
was particularly pleased with my honourable
friend's resolution when I noticed these words
again included, as they were last year:
with power to send for persons, papers and
records.
I hope that if there is to be further investigation into this matter, which is one of the
most important questions in Canada-if not
the most important-that persons, papers and
records will be sent for and secured. And in
that connection may I refer to a new star

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, although I am lot very strongly in favour
of resuming or continuing the inquiry into
the Canadian railroads problem, I do not
intend to object to the proposed committee
completing its work, if possible, so that it
may bring in a suitable report, sufficient for
this inquiry.
May I be allowed to express the disappointment I felt last year on finding that the
committee had considered it neither practieable nor suitable to hear, along with a
number of the present officials of the Canadian
National, some men who can speak of the
existing situation of the Canadian National
without fear of displeasing the Minister of
Transport or compromising the Government.
I have in mind men of large experience, who
are free to give us the benefit of that experience: men like Mr. Morrow, of Toronto,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All I can tel

agreed to that motion. So we are together

and Mr. Edouard Labelle, of Montreal, who
acquired iprecious knowledge through acting
for several years as directors of our National

was also a director of the Canadian National
that he is not proposed as a member of the

Last year the committee was the scene
of- a long contradictory meeting between
representatives of the Canadian Pacifie Railway and the Canadian National Railways.

is synonymous with that of our country.
But the money of the people, the billions
spent by our governments for the building,
the upkeep and the maintenance of the Canadian National railroads, can we overlook all
that? The leaders responsible for the welfare
of the country cannot be indifferent in that
respect. Are we sufficiently informed on the
true financial situation of the two railroads
to judge with authority? Could the committee last year encompass the financial problem due to the Canadian National Railways'
deficits? It is hard to think so, after reading
the report of the sittings.
I read last month. in a magazine called
L'Actualité Economique, of Montreal, an excellent article written by a distinguished young
lawyer and professor of Montreal University,
Mr. Jean-Marie Nadeau. He discusses with
great clarity the main facets of the problem.
This article, altogether very impartial, deserves
to be included in the record, if I may have
the permission of honourable members to place
if there.
The motion was agreed to.
INQUIRIES NOT ANSWERED

to-morrow morning from the various departments concerned and find out why they have
not been able to give me the answers to these
inquiries during the past three weeks.

DISCUSION

OF REPLY

TO INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Black:
That he will eall the attention of the Senate
to the matter contained in the reply to his
inquiry of the 17th January, 1939, respecting
Canadian National Railways.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: I rise to a
point of order. It is entirely unusual for a
member of the Senate wbo has asked certain
questions and received replies to them to give
notice that he intends to discuss the replies
at the next sitting of the House. In this
particular case I contend that to proceed with
a discussion of them now would bc entirely
out of order, because last evening we adopted
a motion by my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) to refer all
the subject-matter contained in those questions and answers to a special committee for
discussion and consideration. It should go to
that committee, although there are, I know,
a number of papers waiting for the claims
the honourable gentleman would like to make.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
first, in reply to the remarks of the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I may say that I think I was quite in
order yesterday. and if lie will read the rules
or the House more carefully he will find this
to be truc. I an quite aware that a member
is not supposed to speak on an answer to an

57

MARCH -8, 1939
inquiry, but he can give notice that on the
following day or days he will discuss the
subjeet-matter contained in the answer. In
giving such notice yesterday and handing it in
writing to the Clerk, 1 was quite in order.
However, I will relieve the mind of the honourable member for the moment. At the
request of some of my friends opposite-not
of the honourable member froma Parkdale, for
he did not make any request-I will postpone
my remarks to a more opportune time.
Now I may be allowed to make this remark
respecting the replies given to my questions.
I arn sorry to say that the reply to question
No. 3 is an evasion rather than an answer.
1 asked a very simple question: what was the
deficit on the Canadian National Railways for
the first nine months of the year. The reply
was that no answer could be given until the
books were audited for the whole year. That
is a reply, but it is not an answer to the
question, and I amn going to ask that the
leader of the bouse give me a definite answer.
We ail reme mber that when we sat in committee for a number of weeks last year announcement was made there and also in the
press as to the losses on each railway for
the first three months of the year. Later on
the newspapers published the bosses for the
first six months. Aside from anything that I
have seen in the press, I know that the system
of bookkeeping adopted by the railways
enables themn to give at any time a monthly
statement of their losses or gains, as well as
a similar statement for everv three months,
six months. nine months and year. 1 hope,
therefore. that the honourable leader will get
for me an accurate answer to the first question I asked. In the meantime, I wibl postpone any further remarks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer I
gave the honouraible senator was that the
information would be available on the 15th
of March. So I may have it 'by next week.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: But I might have had it
yesterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wibb draw the
attention of the department to my honourable
friend's remark.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Thank you.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourabe senator from Parkdabe (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) wish to, proceed with his point of
order?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is entireby
satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: 1 maintain, however,
that I was quite in order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We will let it go
at that.

DIVORCE BILLS
FIRST READINGS

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, presented the following Bills, which were severally read the first
tiîne:
Bill C, an Act for the relief of Edythe
Marjorie Burke Atkinson.
Bilb D, an Act for the relief of Marie Louise
Rossetti Di Rosa.
FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 13, an Act to amend the Food and
Drugs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, perbaps I
may be permitted to make a few remarks on
the objects of the amendments proposed in
this Bill. The initial legislation on the subject
by the Parbiament of Canada was passed in
1874, under the name of the Adulteration Act.
That Act was administered by the Department
of Inland Revenue until 1920, when the
Department of Healtb came into being. At
that time the Food and Drugs Act was passed,
and it bas been in force ever since. Amendments were made to the Act on two occasions.
In 1927 it was enlarged to bring 'biological
products under its control, and in 1934 provision was made respecting the sale of remedies
for tubercubosis, cancer and certain other
diseases, if these remedies were advertised to
the general public.
The enactment itself is one to protect the
public in the matter of food and drugs. With
the scientific improvements that are constantly
being made, and the advance in chemistry,
it is found from time to time that new food
and drug preparations are coming on the
market. As to dnîgs, some of tbemn are of such
a character that it would be most inadvisable
to permit them to be distributed to the public
except under very careful supervision.
One of the most important amendments in
this Bill is contained in the first section, whicb
extends the definition of "drug." This amendment will provide for surgical materials sucb
as sutures, bandages, gauze, sponges and
things of that character to corne under the
supervision of the department. Heretofore
they have not been supervised. and it is well
known that at tîmes very serlous conditions
have resulted from faulty sterilization of
suture material, gauzes. sponges, and so on.
New biological produr'ts that are used to-day,
particularly in tbe diagnosis of allergy, are
also covered by thîs definition. Cosmetîca,
which now are not controlled in any way,
will also, for the first time, be subjeet to insliection. The term "cosmetics" as used here

SENATE
is a xvide one and includes such things as
shaving creams, eye washes, hair dyes, rouge,
lip'stiezk. and so forth. Some of these products
contain certain substances which may be
poisonnus and liable to cause severe irritationi to the skin. A high degree of care is
required in their manufacture and it is felt
that the products shouid be brought under
certain control.
It is also feit that the department should
have some control ox er disinfectants, whichi
are tised for the destruction of vermin in
homes and factories where foods are propared.
These produets contain poisonous substances
and in appearance are such that they are
mistalken for sncbi things as foeur, baking soda,
corn stareh and other ingredients used for cooling« in the kitchen. It is hioped that under
departmentai control some schemo may be
worked uut wh,2rby manufacturers of disinfoctants will colour their products so as to
iessen the danger of thoir being rnisaken for
the other things 1 have mentionted.
Somne new definitions are contained in section 2. "Modicinie" is defined to include certain glandular extracts, w'hichi are being made
to-day in laboratories throughout the world.
Tliese extracts are vert' powerfui in their
reaction on thc human body, and it is feILt
theY siiould be subjected to a more riid

Hlonourable members xviii notice that "manufartuire" is defined as meaoiog "manufacture
for sale." This xviii ot appiy to medical research materiais nor to certain articles that
are, distributed to scientific laboratories for
testing purposes.
tevtion 3 prox ides for control of packaginz. the object being to prevent the slack
filiing of packages. The second part of this
ameodment requires a declaration of net contents on packages of cosmetics. Under the
Act as it reads at preseot packages weighing
less than two ounces gross are exempted, and
cosmeties are usuaiiy in smali packages.
Section 4 empowers the department to designate any Dominion analyst as inspector. As
honourable members wiil understand, the work
of the department is extensive, reaching
throug-hout the who]e of Canada, and it is
almost impossible to maintain at ail times
an adequate staff of inspectors. The department cao designate as Dominion anaiysts
certain qualified persons in the employ ni the
Dominion, or of a province or city, and under
this amendment the department wnuid be
further authorized to designate any Dominion
analyst as inspector.
Heretofore it has been the practice, but
not defiuiiteiy a roquiremnent, to pubiish in
the Canada Gazette reg-ulations made from
Hon. Mr. KING.

time to time under the Act. The amendment
in section 6 wili make such publication obligatory, so that manufacturers, importers, dealers
and other interested parties may be kept infonmed ni the regulations.
Section 7 gives the department powver to
order that the manufacturer ni any article
ni fond or drug shall provide a certificate
that the article in question complies with the
requirements of the Act. The reason for this
amendment is that in certain produets it is
difficuit to detect irregulari tics by analysis.
Section 8 is designed to prevent misrepresentation in adx ertising.
That is. it places
advertiscments on the samne footing as labels
in this respect.
In secion 9 there are new provisions xvith
regard to the expert trade. Certain products
made in Canada, which are not saleabie bn this
country, because they do not comply with our
own Act, cao be legally soid in nther countries.
A form of licence viii ýbe provided under
which manuifacturers xvili ho permitted te,
export such produets to countries wherc their
sale is legal.
Section 10, the last section, provides for
proclaiming ni the Act in portions, to permit
ni conformity by the trade wbth the new
requirements. It xvill ho readily understood
that the trade wbll require some montlis te
adjust stocks ni cosmotios, for instance, and
generaily to got into a position for conforming
with the Act as amended.
It bias been the practice in the past to cefer
ameodments to this Act to the Standing
Committce on Public Health and Inspection
ni Fonds.
I xvould suggest to honou~rable
members that this Bill bo sent to that coinmittoe.
Some additinnai ameodments have
come in-I recoived a number myseif this
morning-from some of the pharmaceuticai
peoplo throug-hout Canada.
These amendmonts cnuid be properly taken up before that
cnmmittee, and xve cnuid have the benofit nf
advice from Mr. Lancaster, vrho administers
the Act in the Department ni Pensions and
National llealth. I shall place before the
committee the ameodments xvhichi came te
me through the mail this moroing, and if
honourable membors desiro te make aoy
suggestions I shahl be giad te have them.
Right Hon. ARTHUTR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, speaking generally, I think
this is a gond Bill, but I am at a bass to
understand its constitutionai basis, and I do
nt know any way ni perfecting that basis by
ameodment. This Bill deals with the sale nf
gonds te the public. It seems te me that
under the very iimited interpretatin given

MARCU 8,1939
North America Act this proposed legisiation
would be found to be ultra vires, and I know
of no0 other section under which we can
justify it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does that apply
to the oId Act as well?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, just as
much as to this Bill. At the sarne time, this
matter should be under faderaI control.
Hon. Mr. RING:

Undoubtedly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEýN: Could one
conceive of anything more ridiculous than
seeking to control drug sales and drug traffic
through nina provincial agendaes? I hope this
phase of our powers will corne before the

findings. Surely our jurisdiction in trade and
commerce should have much wider application

Council has given to it.

accordance
with
logic and international
courtesy to require a licence for exporting
from another country into ours, rather than
a licence as to the conditions which he must

am flot attacking the purpose of the department, but I think we are geing too far in
seeking to license a manufacturer of cosmeties
in Detroit in order to make sure his produet
shall be sound an.d healthful when it reaches
Canada.
Paragraphi (k) should also be notcd. The
regulations may prohibit the sale or define
"the conditions of sale of any substance which
may be injurious to healtb when used as a
food or drug" or may restriet "in like manner its use as an ingredient in the manufacture of food or drug." As this is drafted, an
Order in Council might provide against the
sale to a physician of a certain drug unless it
contained, say, an admixture of some alloy
or other drug. I do not think tbe intention
is to tell the physician what kind of drug to
tise. It is rather to proteet the public. It has
been suggested to me by some pharmaceutical
manufacturers that the words "to the publie" shouid be inserted after the word "sale"
in lines 34 and 35.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act respecting
the appoiotment of Auditors for National
Raiiways.
He said: Honourable senators. hy a statute
passed in 1932-33 annuai legisiation is required
for the appointment of Canadian National
auditors. Since then the necessary Act bas
been passed each year.
To continue the
tradition I 00W move the second reading of
thîs Bill for the appointment of George A.
Touche and Company, of the cities of Toronto
and Montreal, chartered accountants, as
independent auditors for tbe year 1939, to
make a continuous audit of the accounts of
tbe National Railways as defined in the Act.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN: This is
the usual Bill, I know, to extend for another
year tbe appointment of George A. Touche
and Company as auditors of the National
Railways.
Inasmuch as tbe audit for the
nine months ending in December is not yet

Goveroment not consider a firm of auditors
who could he a little more expeditious?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Sometimes tbe
compiaint sbould be addressed elsewhere.
Frmmy experience of other companies I
knew it sometimes happens tbat for soe
domestie reason the auditors are bampered
in their work, and cannot be ready for the
annual meeting, which is therefore adjourned.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.

OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 25, an Act to authorize
an Agreement between His Majesty the Ring
and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
He said: flonourable members, tbis aiso
is a Bill that comes te us yeariy,_ in virtue
of an Act passed in 1920. At lirst the agreement ran for five years; then, in 1924, it
xvas extended for one year.
In 1925 the
period of the agreement was again changed
to five years, and the amount payable
annualliy to the city of Ottawa was increased
from $75,000 to $100,000. In 1931 we resumed
tbe one-year period, and up to 1938 we have
annuaily authorized the paymcot of $100,000
in lieu of tbe taxes that the city might bave
been expected to receive froma the Goveroment of Canada. I 110W move the second
readingý cf this Bill, the purpose of which
is to extend the agreement for another year.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
LOAN

COMPANIES

BILL

S ECOND READING

Hion. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

second reading cf Bill 27, an Act te amend
the Loan Companies Act.
He said: Honotîrabie senators. the purpose
of this Bill, which amends the Loan Companties Act, is te give boan cempanies tbe
power te establish pension funds. The Bihl
aise extends the power back te tbe time of
the commencement of the cempanies, just
as if they had had that power from the date
of their incorporation.
There is a second clause which provides:
Notwithstanding the provisions ef section
three et this Act, the provisions of subsection
one of this section shail apply te every boan
company, whenever incoripurated, whose incorporation is subjeet te the legishative jurisdictien et the Parliament of Canada.

MARCH 8, 1939
The explanation is that section 3 of the
principal Act confines the application of the
Act to companies incorporated before June
l3, 1914. Subsection 2 of the section inserted
by the Bill will make clear its application to
all Dominion loan companies.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is
any objection to giving it, I will not press
for it.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it is worth while pointing out here that as by enabling Acts we
authorize special pension provisions of financial organizations, or ratify the pension or
insurance funds they have already established, we make more difficult the instiunemployof
any
in Canada
tution
ment insurance law of a general character.
I do not know that any company should defer
action on that account. But through one
form of ingenuity or another enough obstacles
have been put in the way of unemployment
insurance to make certain that its re-birth will
be long delayed; and when you enable companies, as you do-and I think properly-to
take care of their own unemployment
problems by pensions, you place them in the
position which the banks occupied when the
last unemployment insurance Act was before
this House, and as a consequence you will
have to exempt companies who would otherwise be the main contributors to an unemployment fund.
There are only two situations in Canada
that I know of in which this Bill could be
of value. The Canada Permanent Mortgage
Corporation is the owner of the Canada
Permanent Trust Company, and there is
another company in London.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my right
honourable friend's remarks apply to the next
Bill on the Order Paper.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Each of the
two Bills is the converse of the other. One
provides that a loan company of Dominion
incorporation may organize a pension fund,
and that if it is associated with a trust company, whether that trust company is a
Dominion incorporation or not, it may organize
a joint pension fund with the trust company. The next Bill is just the converse
of this one. It says that a trust company of
Dominion incorporation may establish a
pension fund, and that if it is associated with
a loan company, whether the loan company
is a Dominion incorporation or not, they
may have a joint pension fund. I am
curious as to which situation is being met.
Is it the Canada Permanent or the Huron &
Erie?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not that
detail before me, but I will give it on the
third reading to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

TRUST COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 28, an Act to amend
the Trust Companies Act.
He said: With the explanations already
given by my right honourable friend, I shall
content myself with moving the second reading of this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read a second time.
TECHNICAL EDUCATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 33, an Act to amend
the Technical Education Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
intended to renew for another five years the
Technical Education Act of 1919, which was
amended in 1929 and in 1934, in order to
allow the Province of Manitoba to take up
the remainder of its original allotment under
the Act of 1919, amounting to $286,000.
The amount voted in 1919 was $10,000,000.
It was apportioned as follows: Prince Edward
Island $198,187.86, which was paid to that
province; Nova Scotia $662,113.94, which was
paid to the province;
New Brunswick
$512,461.28, paid; Quebec $2,569,655.53, paid;
Ontario $3,178,608.97, paid; Manitoba $719,746.56, of which $433,709.17 was paid to the
province, the remainder, $286,037.39, being
the arnount with respect to which we are now
legislating; Saskatchewan $847,620.91, Alberta
$678,524.40, and British Columbia $633,080.55,
which amounts were paid to those provinces
respectively.
It is felt that we should give further leeway
to the province of Manitoba, and should
enable that province to enjoy the full amount
which was allotted to it. There has been a
request here and there for a renewal of the
Act of 1919-it was voiced by Hon. Mr.
Lawson in the other House-and this is the
answer. As to the suggestion that the 1919

SENATE

62

Act be extended, and that a certain amount
again be voted for distribution among theprovinces, Mr. Rogers said:
We had to consider this whole question rather
carefully when we undertook certain responsibilities in connection with youth training. The
specifie recommendation of the National Employment Commission was that this Government
should, in co-operation with the provinces, make
technical training available for unemployed
young people. We have been doing that under
the youth training plan. It has already been
announeed that at this session of Parliament a
Bill will be introduced to provide for a continuance of youth training over a period of
three years, so that I should feel that in very
large measure the Government had responded
to the opinion which, I agree, is prevalent in
the country, that there is a need for technical
education. We did accept the view that the
need was most urgent with respect te unemployed young people, and, as I have said, we
are seeking to meet that need through the
youth training program.
I thought it would be interesting to the
Senate to have that explanation of the sort
of legislation that is to be brought before
Parliament.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have no objection to the
second reading of the Bill, but I think the
Minister was rather unfortunate in making the
plea that the Government are now carrying
on technical education through the youth
movement. The Government are carrying on
political education of a very skilful character. I read the literature myself and was
The bluebook is most
almost persuaded.
attractive, and one would think the heart of
the Government was-shedding drops of ruddy
gore over the plight of the youth of Canada,
and was working hard for their salvation. But
when one comes to the table which appears in
the book, one finds it illuminating indeed.
I wish I had it here so that I might properly
depict the harvest of this long and arduous
toil.
Is it not a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
payment which is made to the province, and
shared by the province?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Minister
has not caught my drift.
The technical
education provision was. The Minister said
that we were only giving authority to pay out
what had net been used, and that only the

which consists in training youths for employment and getting them positions. Employment service is combined with youth training.

could not help keeping in memory, although
I did not try. The youths are paid so much
while they are being trained for positions.
The employment service then stands ready to
get them positions. In my honouraible friend's
province the numbers trained ran into the
thousands-I cannot be certain of the number
of thousands. Will anyone attempt to guess
how many of those trained got positions?
If honourable members can stand the shock,
I will tell them. There were twenty-five!

COMMITTEE

CHiNGE OF CHAIPLMN'SHIP

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable members, I desire to draw attention to the change
in the chairmanship of the Divorce Conmittee. I sec in front of me the young gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans)
who for so long a time presided over the
committee. For some reason he thought be
shouild retire. He was not present at its

63

MARCH 9,1939
opening session; neither was I. The committee
accepted his resignation and asked me to
succeed him. I am discharging the duties of
the office to the best of my ability. I greatly
regret that the honourable gentleman saw fit
to withdraw from the committee after having
filled the office of chairman so capably. If
he thought that he should resign on account
of age, he made a great mistake, for I never
in my life saw him looking better. I should
be very glad to withdraw as chairman of the
committee and have him resume in that
capacity.
Honourable rnernHon. L. MeMEANS:
bers, I desire to express my appreciation and
thanks to the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) for mentioning me as Chairman of the Divorce Committee. However, I
felt, in fact I knew, that I would be succeeded
by the honourable gentleman, and I considered
him an abler and better man for the job.
He is younger. I can assure the House that
the work of the Divorce Committee will be
carried on better and with more vigour,
judgment and strength under the chairmanship
of the honourable gentleman.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I think my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and myself owe
it to the House to thank the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) and his colleagues for the arduous and unpleasant work
which they have perforned for the Senate,
whose duty it is to deal with divorce matters
before they go to the Commons. The work
which devolves upon the members of the cornmittee requires much more labour than usually
falls upon the shoulders of honourable members who sit on other committees. I think,
therefore, I am only doing my duty in thanking the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. McMeans) for having carried on the work of
chairman of that committee for so many years
with such great success.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I do not know of any post
that I would be more eager to avoid than
that of Chairman of the Divorce Committee,
and I add my voice to that of the leader of
the House in expressing appreciation to a
man who bas served as chairman for so long
and in such an acceptable manner.
I am pleased indeed to know that the successor to the late chairman is the honourable
senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson).
I hope never to come before the committee
under his chairmanship, but I know that if
do I shall get justice.

grants the right to its use under the conditions set out in the measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I think the rule means

is not a lapse of two days between the first

Only one of these companies, the Huron

does net cover the establishment of a joint
fund.
The two loan companies mentioned in the
explanatory note as associated withi trust
companies are the Huron and Erie Mortgage
Corporation, associated with the Canada
Trust Company. and the Canada Permanent
Mortgage Corporation, associated with the
Canada Permanent Trust Company. The
Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation lias
established a pension fund under the authority contained in its special Act.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN:
The
honourable leader of the House bas misapprehended niy question. The information

can apply to only one of two sets of circumstances; either, in the one, to the Canada
Permanent Mortgage Corporation, which owns
the Canada Permanent Trust Company. or,
in the other, to the Huron and Erie Mortgage
Corporation, which owns the Canada Tru-st

wants the Bill. The leader of the House says
the Huron and Erie has a pension fund of
its own. I presume it wants the Bill.

Manitoba.
Hie said: Honourable members, the purpose
of this Bill is to, confirm an agreement for the

of certain tracks and premises of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company in the city of
Winnipeg. At the present time the line of the
Midland Railway ýCompany crosses certain
streets in the city, which streets are also
crossed by the Canadian Pacifie tracks. The
agreement provides for abandonment of the
Midland Railway tracks. It is a simple
matter, but, if desired, I will, after the Bill
has been given second reading, move that it
be referred to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is the Midland
Railway to abandon its lines over the streets
and use the lines of the Canadian Pacifie?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON:
Honourable members, the only object of this Bill
is to change the name of the company to prevent its being confused with fraternal societies. There is a society known as the Ancient
Order of Foresters, and, as this is purely
a mnutual ifisurance company, the original
choice of a naine was unfortunate. The
company now, therefore, wishes to remedy the
defect in order that people may not be misled
into thinking it is a fraternal society.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

66
PENITENTIARY

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 34, an Act respecting
Penitentiaries.
He said: Honourable senators, at present
the penitentiaries are directed and administered by a superintendent and thrce inspectors,
as officers of the Department of Justice. The
general purpose of this Bill is to establish
a commission with power, under the Minister
of Justice, to control and manage the penitentiaries. To attain this objective it is necessary to amend, as well as to renumber, many
of the sections of the Penitentiary Act, and
for the purpose of clarity the provisions of
the Act have been amended and consolidated
in the present Bill.
I should give a short explanation of the
reason for the Bill, which is presented with
the modifications I have just mentioned. It
follows the recommendation of a royal commission which was appointed a year or two ago,
under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Archambault, after nuch agitation in the country for
a study of our penitentiary system and for
an inquiry into its functions and administration. Considerable trouble had arisen on
divers occasions out of the administration of
the penitentiaries and in some of those institutions bad resulted in serious disturbances,
which in certain instances had even reached
the point of riot and rebellion. The House of
Commons-and the Senate too, at times, if
I am not mistaken-discussed that situation.
The royal commission presented a most elaborate and voluminous report. That report,
which recommended considerable modification
of the Penitentiary Act, was generally very
well received throughout the land, and in many
places was highly approved.
The present measure comes to us in the
sanie form as the Bill brought to the Senate
during the later days of last session. That
Bill came in too late to permit of a fair
review of the report as a whole, or to allow
senators interested in the legislation to read
the report in its entirety. As the Bill presented last year to this House affected particularly, I might say almost exclusively, the
then superintendent, General Ormond, who
was to be replaced by a commission, attention was focussed on the corresponding part
of the report. My right honourable friend
felt that General Ormond was very harshly
and in some respects unjustly dealt with.
After a short discussion the Senate decided
to reject the Bill, in protest, I surmise, against
the treatment of the superintendent in the
report.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

'

But we must take the recommendations as
a whole, just as they come before us, as from'
them proceed the Bill which I now present.
The report naturally is the work of men
who conscientiously did their duty as they saw
it. I quite realize that one may not agree
with their findings on all points; nevertheless
I am sure there is general agreement in regard to the desirability of bringing about the
improvenents suggested. The principal feature, governing the whole reform of the
penitentiaries, is implemented by this Bill.
The superintendent is replaced by a comnmission of three, and the tbree inspectors are to
becorne assistant commissioners. This is the
only change made in the Act, because it is
felt, and it seems quite reasonable, that the
commission to he appointed should have tire
to study the situation and report upon the
proposed changes. These reforms will not he
made suddenly or as a whole; they will come
progressively as the commission decides they
are fit and proper to be made.
I should like to say a word as to the importante and opportuneness of making the
change froin a superintendent to a commission. I understand that the commission system
exists in various forms in the United States
and in Great Britain and that in those two
countries all the penitentiaries are not iunder a
single superintendent. It must be remembered
that in Canada we are dealing with institutions
widely separated, extending from Dorchester,
in the Maritime Provinces, right across the
country, there being one in Quebec, one in
Ontario, one in the Prairie Provinces and one
in British Columbia. Within the walls of these
institutions are men who, to say the least,
have been quite unruly in our communities.
Many of them are dangerous criminals. The
administration of such institutions requires
men with numerous qualifications. They are
constantly confronted by difficult and exacting situations, and sometimes by delicate
problems which demand solution. It may be
said that individually these men will probably
be no better qualified than the Minister of
Justice, but under the present Act the Minister of Justice must rely upon the superintendent for advice in matters concerning the
organization and well-being of the penitentiaries. I feel that this is too heavy a
load to place on the shoulders of one man,
narnely the superintendent, and it should be
shared by a commission of three carefully
selected men who have a single eye to the
performance of their duties. I believe that
such men can be found.
I may say that it was after one o'clock this
morning when I finished reading for the second
time the discussion that took place in the

MARCH 9, 1939
House of Commons, in order that I might have
an idea of the objections which had been
raised. I found that the debate there had
closed in a love feast around Miss Agnes
Macphail, who had succeeded in carrying her
point for the establishment of a royal commission.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the House will recall that,
as the honourable leader has mentioned, this
Bill came before us last session. It came just
as we were getting on our cloaks to leave.
Indeed, we had only a few minutes left. It
had a formidable appearance, its arrival was
preceded by a long debate in the other
Chamber, and, with that keen sense of duty
which we always try at least to give evidence
of, we did not like to attack it at that stage
of the session. The House has therefore waited
with considerable curiosity and interest for
the production of the measure this session.
It is the product of a long investigation by
three very eminent men, an investigation
which covered the length and breadth of
Christendom in two hemispheres. It has been
heralded to the country as signalling the dawn
of a new era in the treatment of prisoners.
In fact, it is little more than a few hours
since I read editorials on the great achievement which is now taking effect, and I also
read news items of congratulation to publie
figures who have been instrumental in opening
the doors of human hearts and at last bringing something in the way of opportunity for
reformation to those who have fallen into
lives of crime.
The Bill reached us yesterday, I think. I
have listened to the explanatory remarks of
the leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and I wonder if any honourable
members here know what its contents really
are. It is nearly one-quarter of an inch
thick. Looking at it from the outside, one
would be quite ready to believe that midnight
oil had been burned over it, and that the
mountain of a commission had laboured and
brought forth something much larger than a
mouse. Whatever it is, I hold it in my hand.
I have gone over every page of it since the
House opened, this being the first opportunity
I had of doing so, and I inform honourable
members that there is nothing whatever in
the measure except provision for abolishing
one job and creating three in its place.
Hon. Mr. POPE: For three Grits.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is nothing more at all in the measure. The whole
Act is rewritten, lest the public should conclude that the expenditure on the royal commission had not been worth while. Behold
71498-5

67

the measure that is the result! From this day
forward, until further changes are made, the
Superintendent of Penitentiaries will be replaced by three commissioners. I state to
the House that this Bill provides that and
nothing else whatever in all its twenty-seven
pages.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is easily
explained.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Thus is reform achieved. Thus is the underworld to
be reclaimed and new life opened to the forgotten man. We are past the dark ages of
vengeance and penalty. We are now basking
in the kindly sunlight of humanitarianism,
because, forsooth, three commissioners are to
take the place of one superintendent. I am
not exaggerating: that is the whole Bill. For
this, distinguished public characters have been
congratulated; for this, thanks have been
passed to the royal commission. It was for
standing in the way of this world-rocking
reform that the Senate was condemned fore
and aft last session. And because of our so
standing in the way the Minister of Justice
said he could not be responsible for maintenance of order in our 'penitentiaries from
that day on. Has the House ever heard of
humbug more transparent and more odious
than that which we have heard about this
Penitentiary Bill?
For myself I do not see any more need
to have one superintendent replaced by three
commissioners than I see for the proverbial
fifth wheel to a coach. I guess there are three
commissioners in England, but that country
has a population of forty-three or forty-four
millions, as compared with our eleven millions. If we need three commissioners, England
ought to have fifteen.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: England is part
of a small island.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it has
a large population and a lot of business is
done there. However, I should not care if
England had twenty penitentiary commissioners.
For many years I had the duty of superintending the work of ticket-of-leave and parole
in Canada, and in that capacity came into
very close contact with our penitentiary system. I was in more or less constant association with the then superintendent, and I
thought he did his duty well. He certainly
never neglected anything that he could find
to do. But I never observed that he was
burdened with work; I never saw him incapable of performing his task because it
was too onerous. In fact, if my recollection

the St. Andrew's Society, and he was able to
take part in ail civic activities that he thougbt
worth while. But 110W we are to have three
commissioners, and hope dawns once more
for persons condemned because of their crime.
I emphasized last session that nothing very
effective, nothing real, could be done by
merely adding to the weight of bureaucracy
at Ottawa. We have a jienitentiary down at
Dorchester, the St. Vincent de Paul in Quebec, one at Portsmouth, one in Manitoba
and another in British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And one in Prince
Albert.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, one in
Prince Albert. That is six in ail. These are
in each case under the charge of a warden, his
dcptity and guards. The one vital man in
connection with every penitentiary is the head
of it, and the next most vital man is his
assistant. If these two men are right in every
case von scarcely need a superintendent.

tbrce members and three assistant commissioners, sitting at Ottawa, as there is forHon. Mr. QUINN: The National Harbours

told us why it is beiieved that three coinmissioniers can performn the necessa ry duties

live in different parts of the country, where
their work is to he done? "The eye of the
master fatteneth the beast."
But I did flot intend to make more than a
generai criticisma of the Bill itseif. My main
object in rising was to point out that if in
tbe pas' the superintendent and tbree inspectors could not run our penitentiaries satisfactoriiy, it shows that it is a mistake to
leave inspection of publie institutions to Government officiais. Honourable members wil
have observed that there bas recentiy been
in New York a criminai triai which bas aroused
a great deai of curiosity among the American
and
al
attorneys
Government
people.
officiais wio bad charge of the criminal
courts or the administration of criminai
justice bave been somewhat besmircbed, and
it was shown that the oniy reiiabie servants
of the public in these courts had been the
grand jury. The grand jury is a timebonoiired institution in our country too, yet
people wbo do nlot know anything about it
hold it in great contempt--want to, wipe it
out. WeIl, in my opinion, one officiai is only
a brother to, another officiai; one civil servant is nlot going to show up bis brother civil
servant; but wben you choose thirteen ordinary citizens to form a grand jury and
inspect public institutions you can rely upon
it that thcy wili tell you more about the way
the institutions are really bcing run than you
couid find out from any other source. I
have had a large experience in connection
with the Factory Act, and I have noticed that
right under the nose of inspector after inspector factories have been permitted te use

machinery wbiclh did not comply with the
requirements of the iaw. Seme time ago,
representiDg a large insurance cempany, I
visited somne of the great factories in Hamilton. anid aithougli I bad ne experience whatever in examining macbinery, I found fauli
after fault. I found the inspecter did nothinf
but go into the office and smoke a cigal
Later I addressed a group of manufacturert
and pointed out to them that in their owî
interest they should report to the Govern
ment any inspecter who did net scrupulously
perform bis duties. As you knew, it is an inherent vice of Gevernment officiais to negleet
their duties. Famiiiarity with their work begets carelessness. Tbey go down to the factory,
look around and comment on the weather.
Then tbey arc invitcd into the office. In al
kinds of inspection 1 flnd the inspecters are
usually trcated with great consideratien and
become very friendiy with the owners cf the
plants inspected. Tlie only inference to he
drawn frem this Bill is that inspection in
the past bas been a wasbout. Yet it is proposed te appoint the present inspectera mcmbers cf tbe Penitentiary Commission.
In the great metropelis cf New York only
the grand jury did its duty. It reformed the
administration of justice; it brought tbe gangsters and their accomplices to, justice; it vindicated tbe law.
In my opinion the oniy body yen can trust
Le inspect a penal or any other institution is
the grand jury. The grand jury is baiiowed
by time; it bas proved itself; it represents
the people; it is net a paid officiai. Why,
we trust everything-our personal liberty,
our preperty rights-to the grand jury because
we believe tbat it is the most reliabie tribunal,
te whicb we can bave recourse,
I submit that if the Government reallyr
desire te reform our 'penitentiaries, thescshould be subject te inspection by grand jury,
and the Attorneys-General of the provinces
should see te it that full oppertunity be
given for a thorough inspection. Nowadays
everybody bas sncb a contempt for the grand
jury and other time-proven institutions that
the grand jurors miglit be just marched
through the penitentiary te be inspected. We
must guard against any mere cursory inspection. Tben grand juries will be in a position
te report on the conditions prevailing in the
penitentiaries. I must confess that tbough
I bave listened te dozens of reports made by
grand juries, I bave neyer known one report
te be acted upon. Indeed, their reports are
treated just as tbougb they were the reports of
royal commissions. This is the first royal

Hon. A. 13. COPP: Honourable members,

that our public institutions should be inspected

for many years in my part of the country.

inspection.
Almot as long as I can remember the
administration of our penal institutions has
been criticized.
The criticism tas become
stronger and more widespread during the last
two years, and tas been endorsed by press and
pulpit and by certain members of the House
of Commons. I may say that personally I was
not very mueh impressed by the charges that
ouir conviets are ill-treated, but possibly I am
somewhat hard-tearted and consequently not
capable of that sympathetie consideration with
whiih others viewed those charges.
My right honourable friend opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) has criticized this Bill
rather severely and asserted that it will not
make for penitentiary reform. Certainly net.
That. as I understand, was net the intention
of the right honourable Minister of Justice
when he introduced this Bill in the other
House. After listening to the debate in the
Commons on our penitentiary system and considering complaints made te him personally,
te came to the conclusion that it would be
wise to appoint a royal commission to make
a thorough investigation. Like other senators. I amn not favourably inclined to the appointnent of royal commissions, but it must
be admitted that sometimes they are a necessary evil. A royal commission was appointed.
I know only one of its meinbers, the chairman,
Mr. Justice Archambault. He and his fellowcommissioners made a lengthy and thorough
investigation of our penitentiaries, and submitted their report to the Minister of Justice.
He studied the report and last session brought
down to the House of Commons a Bill, somewhat similar to the present measure, to give
effect to thc royal commission's recommendation for the establishment of a penitentiary
commission composed of three members.
Rightly or wrongly, the right honourable Minister feit te should net take the responsibility
of etanging the present system, and it will
be the duty of these commissioners to study
our penitentiaries and report to him their
conclusions. In reply te my right honourable friend I may say that the question of
reform is not dealt with by this Bill. As
I undcrstand the measure, its purpose is to
establish the necessary machinery to effect
whatever reforms may be deemed advisable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What was
wrong with the old machinery? The royal
commis ion was appointed to suggest reforms.
If they suggested reforms, you have the machinery to put those reforms into effect. How
many steps are you going to take?

MARCH 9,1939
Hon. Mr. COPP: I am pointing out the
position which the Minister of Justice took.
He has taken the opposite view. By this Bill
he is asking for power to appoint three commissioners to study the question and report
to him. He, in turn, will report to Council.
Then, if further legislation is considered necessary, it will be introduced. During the debate
in the other House the Minister of Justice
said that eventually, whatever Government
might be in office, various amendments would
have ta be made to the Penitentiary Act to
give effect to the recommendations.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: May I
ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Certainly.

commissioners will only be able to reportHon. Mr. COPP: That is not a question.

coming to my question-what the inspectors
tell them. They will not go to the penitentiaries. Why could not one commissioner,
just as well as three commissioners, report
what the inspectors tell him?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I cannot see why the
commissioners themselves would not have the
fullest opportunity of going to the different
penitentiaries, with or without the inspectors.
All the Minister seeks to ensure by this Bill
is that the administration of the penitentiaries
shall be carried on under a better system.
This objective may cost a few thousand
dollars more. While I am as eager as my
honourable friend to save the taxpayers'
money, I think that in much of his criticism
he is straining at a gnat and swallowing a
camel. In my view this is a very reasonable
Bill. Its enactment will afford opportunity
for further study of the question with a view
to removing, if that be possible, any cause for
further criticism of our penitentiary system.
I shall be very happy to support the motion
for second reading.
Hon. G. GORDON: I understand that
after investigating our penitentiaries and taking the evidence of officials and of hundreds
of convicts, the royal commission went to
There they examined none but
England.
officials.. I believe that had they followed the
same course when in England as they followed
while here, the convicts in the British penitentiaries would have complained pretty much
along the same lines as the convicts in our
penitentiaries. As a business man, and I do
not pretend to be anything else, I do not
think the royal commission acted fairly to
our own penitentiary system in failing to

71

examine the inmates of the British penal
institutions. In a word, they had no proper
basis on which to compare the two systems.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUETTE (Translation): Honourable senators, the Government
have introduced a Bill to establish a Penitentiary Commission composed of three members. As a Canadian citizen I recognize the
difficulty of the task with which the Minister
of Justice is faced. I also recognize the importance of the role which the members of
the Penitentiary Commission will be called
upon to play. As a medical man I believe
the commission should include a physician
versed in criminology.
Allow me to quote the following words
spoken by the honourable member for Portneuf on June 18, 1938, in the House of Commons:
I think the Minister will agree with me that
penitentiary administration is not simply a
question of economy and discipline, but that
the mental condition of the inmates must also
be considered. The appointment to this commission of a physician who would make a
special study of the general health and
mentality of the prisoners seems to me indispensable. Many crimes can be attributed to
mental derangement. A physician versed in
criminology could render useful service in
penitentiary administration, not only as regards
the physical health of the inmates, but also
their moral rehabilitation, so that at the
expiration of their sentence they may return
to normal life and contribute to the development of the country.
According to the report of the Royal Commission to investigate the Penal System of
Canada, the problem of administration is too
comprehensive and serious to leave to a single
administrator. In fact, Canada is perhaps the
only country where the penal system is not
administered by a commission or board.
In Great Britain the prison board is composed of a chairman and two members, one
of whom looks after the administrative side
and the other the medical side. It is gratifying to note the presence on that board of
one or more physicians, who render the greatest services to the community.
The punishment of criminals proceeds from
a principle of justice and social necessity and
should ensure the expiation of the crime, the
reform of the criminal and the protection of
the community. I have confidence in the spirit
of justice of the Government, which will solve
this social problem. It is acknowledged that
environment can sometimes promote crime.
Statistics show that a considerable number
of youthful inmates of our penitentiaries are
there because of our failure to solve the
economic problem of unemployment. I made
it my duty to visit one of Canada's large
penitentiaries. I also made a special study

SENATE
of this question, particularly from the medical
point of view, and I am convinced that the
appointment of a physician to the commission
will make for the protection of the community
and the rehabilitation of the criminals.
May I inquire
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
whether this Bill will be sent to a select committee?
The question
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
had not presented itself to my mind. I had
thought we might have it before the Committee of the Whole.
There are one or two things I desire to say
before the debate is closed. If anyone else
wishes to speak, I will defer my remarks.
What I want to say is this. The present
Bill, though it is voluminous and may seem
formidable, is intended simply to replace
the superintendent by a commission. Inasmuch as the superintendent is mentioned in
twenty or twenty-five clauses of the Act, those
clauses have had to be amended. It may
appear from the Bill that the only change
to be made is the one to which I have referred, but honourable senators will find that a
considerable number of reforms are suggested
in the report of the royal commission. Some
of them, as the report states, can be carried
out by regulation, and in fact a number of
them have already been carried out. Others
are to be effected by amendments to the Act.
I think this is sufficient to explain that the
Bill cannot be judged by the simple fact that
we are transforming the superintendent into a
commission. As the honourable.senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) has said, this
measure provides the machinery whereby the
Penitentiary Act will be applied. It is but
the basis to be used in the task of reforming
the Act and the administration of the penitentiaries.
Se, when my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Calder) asks if we intend to send the Bill to
a select committee, I reply that it is not worth
while. Once we have decided that the superintendent is to be replaced by a commission,
the amendments will follow.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I had intended to
say a word after I got a reply to my question. I shall be very brief. The leader of
the Government has, in my judgment, stated
very clearly the purpose of the Bill. I can
hardly take the ground that the Bill is useless, because, after all, its value will depend
upon what the commissioners will do. I can
see no necessity for the Bill going to a committee, because as I read it-and I have read
it very hurriedly-there is only one point involved, namely, the substitution of a commission for the superintendent. If you refer to
Hon. Mr. PAQUETTE.

section 7 of the Bill'and compare it with the
old section covering the same subject, you
will find that the two are virtually identical.
If there is to be reform under this measure
it can come only through the action of the
commission, upon the approval of the Minister.
There is point in the contention that the
handling of penitentiaries is by no means an
easy matter. Penitentiaries are governed by
rules and regulations of all kinds. Those rules
and regulations must be made, and they must
be proper rules and regulations. As I understand it, there bas been a great deal of complaint about the existence of certain rules,
and also about their application in our penitentiaries. I think that is the whole question
te be considered. I can conceive that there
may b real reform in the management of
our penitentiaries, but that cannot be achieved
unless the three commissioners are properiy
selected. The mere appointment of three men
in order to give them jobs would be most
unfortunate.
And most unHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
worthy of the Minister of Justice, whoever
he might be.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
It would be. So,
while the Bill itself does not indicate the
nature of the reforms that are to come, it
certainly provides the means wbereby reforms
may be made. The only point is whether the
work cean b better carried out by three men
than by one. That is a matter on which all
of us will have our own opinion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

that the amendments in the Bill are simply

Now, shall we send this Bill to Committee

reading?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

MARCH 9,1939
Right Haon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think. it
ought ta go to Committee of the Whole. One
memrber spoke to me about a certain matter
just a few minutes ago. While the Bill purports only to make the change from a superintendent ta three commissianers, one of the
aid sections-I cannat recali the number-provided that the guards should be approved by
the warden. That provision is struck out. It
is cvidently thought that these three gentlemen sitting in Ottawa will know much more
about what kind of guard wîll be good in
Edmonton or in Prince Albert than will the
warden.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have an answer
ta that very question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The right bonaurable gentleman is probably referring ta
section 10.
Rigbt Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Maybe. It
was tbe honaurable senator fromn Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) wbo mentioned the matter ta me.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Section 10 says:
The Governor in Council may-

The wardens, deputy wardens and other
administrative or executive officers so appointed
shaîl be paid such salaries as are approved by
the Governor in Council.

Right Han. Mr. MEJOHEN:

That is ail

rigbt. It is the next clause, number il:
The Commission may appoint such guards,
trade instructors and other subordinate officers,
employees and servants as are necessary....
The commission is now going ta do that,
whereais the superintendent did it before, on
the recommendation of the warden. The
warden is responsible for whatever the guards

do; they are bis instruments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think my
right bonourable friend will be reconciled ta
this clause when I give the explanation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

The explana-

tion will have ta be exactly the opposite of
the one given witb the Bill, whicb says:
This clause is similar ta subsections 1 and 2
of the present section 20A. ...
The present
subsections read as follows:
"20A. (1) The Superintendent may, upon the
recommendation of the warden, appoint such
guiards, trade instructors and other subardinate

and then came the new words:
--on the recommendation of the Commission
approved by the MinisterRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. The aid
section said:
The Superintendent may, upon the recoin-

officers and employees as are necessary."
The complaint is that the words "upon the
recommendation af the warden" are dropped.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I tbink that is very
important.

trade instructors and other subordinate officers

it is.

mendation of the warden, appoint such guards,
and employees as are necessary for the service
of any of the penitentiaries.

Under the Bill these things will be done by a
commission whicb will be a tbousand or two
thousand miles away. With their superior
wisdom, sitting with ahl the paraphernalia of
the Cabinet, they will be able ta pick out
guards-pick them out of the sea or out
of the air.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would point
out that it was my right bonourable f riend
himself who amended that clause.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

What clause?

I neyer amended any clause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend's Government.

My right honour-

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable gentleman will look at the opposite page
of the Bill be will see that the Act reads

as I have stated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

it was.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

I sbould say

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am looking at
the Bihl as it passed through committee in
the House cf Commans, and at the explanations given on clause 11.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think that is a very
important change. 0f course, it can be considered in committee. After alI, the warden
is responsible for the institution, and unless
there is provision in the Bill that the warden's
recommendations must at least be taken into
consideration in connectian with certain cf
these appointments, there will be great danger.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would the word of
the warden be worth more than that cf the
tbree members cf the commission?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should say it would
be worth three times as much.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The one warden?

Take the Act as

It said:

The Governor in Council may appoint such
wardens, deputy wardens and other administrative or executive officers as are required
for the proper administration and management
of the penitentiaries.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The one warden who
is responsible, and who bas bad a long experience in that kind cf work and knows
exactly the type of man bie wants ta handle
the work. Under this Bill, if an application

certain guards or men in the machine shop,
the commission jtself bas foul power to make
the appointments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would bring
to your attention the statement of the Minister of Justice. H1e was replying to the
member for Toronto, Mr. Churcli, who said:
1 understand that this commission is to be
under the control and management of the
Minister himself; that is, it is to ho a departmental commission uniler the Minister. This
section is the same as section 20 of the o]d
Act, and I should liko te ask the Minister
what is being clone iii order to obtain guards,
deputy wardens and wvardens of the proper
type. You cannot learn this business in a
day. The warden an(l deputy wardon are the
chief officers, and in the absence of the warden
the deputy takes his place. Is any system
proposed for the training of these men, or
will they just ho brought in f rom their privato
occupations to act as wardens, deputy ivardens
and so on, and have their salaries fixed by the
commission?
Under clause 10, which I said was the clause
amended by my right honourable friend's
Government, the higher officiais were selected
by the Civil Service Commission. The Honourable Mr. Guthrie, wvas i?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
know.

I do nlot

Hon. MIr. DANDURAND: The Minister of
Justice moved to aniend the clause so as to
withdraw from the jurisdiction of the Civil
Service Commission ail the higlior officiais and
leave their appointment to the Governor in
Couincil. The Right Honourahie Mr. Lapointe
approved of that system and supported the
view that those men should be appointed by
the Governor in Council, on the recommendatien of the Minister of Justice, and ho gave
various reasons why the Civil Service Commission was net in a position to judge of the
moral value and competency of those men.
This was the reform made in 1933.
Now. here is the answer of Mr. Lapointe
with respect to the guards. and se forth, who
are mentioned in clause Il. In answering Mr.
Church. he said:
if my honourable friend rofers to the new
system we want to inaugurate, the guards who
will be appointed by the commission will have
te undergo training and will be appointod only
after their qualifications have been fully
approved and recognized. Then the'y will be
given the opportunity te show their capacity,
their character, their ahility te manage, and
so on, and the intention is that deputy wardens
and wardens will bo appointod f rom among
the men who have made good ie the various
services of the penitentiaries.
Up te the present nothing of this kind bas
existed. 1 know how diffienît it bas heen in
the past for Ministers of Justice te find the
best possible men te put at the head of the
various penitentiaries. When men already in
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

the service could be appointed, after they had
proved that they could assume the responsibility, they usually were appointed. Otherwise
it is a difficult task for the authorities te find
the best available men. As a matter of fact,
at the present time there are one or two
vacancies, and 1 have the varieus officers of
the department at work tryiug_ te find thse
best possible mon te appoint. I heliove that
%vith the system which will he organizod it
xviii be possible te obtain trained men. It is
even the intention te have a training sehool
under the commission-of course on a smaller
scale-such as they have in England, which
has proved te be such a valuable institution
in furnishing men qualified te administer
penitentiaries.
With this explanation as te the intention
of the Government, I wiil move that the Bill
he placod on the Order Paper for reference
te Comimittee of the Whole on Tuesday evening ncxt. If my honourable friends will kindly
read the whole of the long debate that took
place in the House of Commons. as I did
last night, they will find, 1 think, that almost
any questions they may have are answered
there. But if they have any new questions
te put, there will ho an opportueity on Tuesday evoning. And may I say that if any
honourable member heliex os a certain man
xvould make an ideal member of the new
commission, 1 arn (uite sure the Minister
of Justice would ho happy te roceivo that
nman's naîîîc. The Minister is des.,irous of appointing coinmissioners who will mneet wvith the
iînanimous approval of Parliament.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I amn in faveur
of having the Bill sent te Comimittee of the
Whole. But may I ask the honourable leader
where this training school that ho speaks of
is going to ho? Say a guard is wanted down
at Dorchester, where is ho te ho sent for
training? And who are te ho the trainers, the
professors, the faculty? Is it the intention
that graduates of this training scliool for
guards shahl he sent eut te variolîs penitentiaries, as and whee they are needed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do net know
where the school is te ho estahlished.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It ail sounds
very well. But what awful nonsense it is,
this idea of estahlishing a training sehool for
pentitentiary guards in Canada! What is
needed in the sehection of a guard is common
sense on the part of somehody who knows hîm.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, it
was ordered that the Bill ho placed on the
Order Paper for reference te Committee of

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK, on behaîf of Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen, moved the second reading of Bill H, an Act respecting the United
Church of Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

Explain.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have been asked
to explain the intent of this Bill. I have in
my hand a copy of a memorandum which, I
think, is also in the possession of the right
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
It is the
Meighen) who sponsors this Bill
joint agreement between the representatives
of the Preshyterian Church and the United
Church, as endorsed hy the Eighth General
Council, and is as follows:
1. That each Church acknowledges the f act
that a dlaim. of continuity has been, and still
is, made by the other.
2. That both Churches agree to approach
together the Federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures as and when the Presbyterian Church may request the United Church
of Canada to make application to the Federal
Parliament and the provincial legisiatures, or
any of these bodies, to obtain the f ollowing
amendmnent (or an amendment to the like
effeot agreed upon by the Sub-executive of the
General Council and the Board of Administration of the Preshyterian Church) to the
United Church of Canada Act:
"Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act, congregations, mendbera and adherents of
the Presbryerian Church in Canada, who did
not on the 1Oth day of June, 1925, become part
of the United Church of Canada and those
who have since that date joined or may hereafter join with themn as niembers or adherenta
mnay use the namne 'The Presbyterian Churelh
in Canada,' but this shahl not in any wayprejudice or affect the rights or powers of'
the United Church of Canada or of. any constituent part thereof or of any corporation,
board, committee or other body created by
or under the government or control of or in
connection with the United Church of Canada
or of any congregation thereof."
3. That both Churches will seek to dwell
together in mutual understanding, composing
their differences upon material things, as far
as in them. lies, by consultation one with the
other, and where possible without recourse to
the civil courts, seeking Yellowship in all good
works for the Kingdom of God; thus afresh
commending the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
That is the purpose of the Bill now before
US.

In 1924 and 1925. as you ail know, an
effort was made te bring about union among
the Methodist, Presbyteriak, and Congregatienai churches. As the movement developed
throughout the iengtb and breadth of Canada, a great many distinguished persons who
had boots boru and boad lived Preshyterians
were stili insistent that Prcsbyterians they
w'ould die. Thev were determined that the
Pre.sbytcrian Cburcb should usot be made a
tbing of the past. The resuit was that after
the passage of the Church Union Bill, which
appeared to take fromn the Presbyterian Church
the right to use the term "Preshbyterian
Church in Canada," many adherents of [bat
Church tbroughout Canada continued ta carry
Conseon their worship as Presbyterians.
quentiy there were misinderstandings cf oe
kind or another between the adherents of the
United Churcb cf Canada and those cf the
Preshyterian Church. Many discussions have
been carried on in a friendly way. This Bill

PENITENTIARY BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 34, ar
Act respecting Penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the chair.
Sections 2 to 4, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 5-powers of Commission:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable aenators, I need hardly repeat that I
consider this entire Bill is a charge on the
Treasury without being of any benefit to the
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend is not in the habit of repeating
himself.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I am
not at all in doubt as to where the House
thinks I stand, but I desire that my conviction be never absent from the mind of
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I may remind him
of it again. This clause reads as follows:
The Commission shall under the Minister,
have the control and management of all penitentiaries and all prisoners and other persons
confined therein and inmates thereof and over
all matters connected therewith.
When I read this clause it seemed to meand I consulted with tae Law Clerk of the
Senate-that it would probably give the Commission authority over the inmates of our penitentiaries in respect of ticket-of-leave and
parole, and I could not believe that it was
the intention of the Minister of Justice that
that power should be in any way transferred
from the Governor General, who acts on the
Minister's advice, and in whom the power has
always rested since this country became a
dominion. It is a matter of importance from
several standpoints, but chiefly one which I
will mention. The prerogative of mercy, in all
its aspects, is a peculiar attribute of the
Sovereign. I believe that in the discussions
leading up to Confederation there was an
effort on the part of some persons to make
this prerogative provincial, but this effort was
resisted very definitely on the ground that
the right appertained essentially to the Throne
and should not be exercised in Canada save
by the direct representative of the Throne.
Of course it is exercised by him on the advice
of the appropriate Minister, not on the advice
of the Government as a whole. It may be
provided by statute that the Minister of
Justice himself can advise, but whether it is
so provided or not, the Minister himself does
advise, and the action of the representative
of the Crown is always taken on the recommendation of his Minister. My impression

77

at the moment, but I may be wrong about it,
is that there is not a statute authorizing the
Governor General to act on the advice of his
Minister in respect of the prerogative of
mercy, but that the prerogative is rather the
inherent right of the Throne, and therefore
of the Throne's representative, though constitutionally he exercises it on the advice of
the Minister.
As I was quite certain that the Minister of
Justice himself would be the last to seek the
removal of this tie between the Crown and
the whole duty and obligation of mercy,
I prepared an amendment to this section to
make clear that it would not have such effect.
I now move the amendment, which is:
That the following be added to section 5, as
subsection 2:
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to extend
or apply to the exercise of the royal prerogative
of mercy, or to the remission service of the
Department of Justice, or to alter or affect
or to authorize any altering or affecting of that
direct control of that service by the Minister
which now exists.
I may say that I discussed th3 subject yesterday with the honourable leader of the
Government, who, I believe, has consulted the
Minister of Justice about it.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I must admit that when I first read
section 5 it did not occur to me that the
privilege of the Crown as exercised to-day on
the advice of the Minister of Justice was
being invaded. The impression I formed was
that the commissioners would act as auxiliaries
to the parole branch and give their advice to
the Minister, inasmuch as they would be in
loser contact with the penitentiaries than
the parole branch at Ottawa is. It is not the
intention of the Minister to transfer to the
Commission the work which is being done by
the parole branch of his department. He
seemed surprised when I drew his attention
to the possibility of this clause being construed
as authorizing such a transfer. In view of the
possible interpretation, which has been pointed
out by my right honourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), the Minister has
advised me to accept the proposed amendment.
The amendment tas agreed to, and section
5, as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 6 to 10, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 11-appointment of guards, trade
instructors and subordinate officers:
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, as will be seen from the explanatory
note on the right-hand page opposite this
clause, the Act at present reads:
The Superintendent may, upon the recommendation of the warden, appoint such guards,
trade instructors and other subordinate officers
and employees as are necessary for the service
of any of the penitentiaries.

SENATE

78

I arn going te ask rny honeniable friend the
leader of tho House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
te, agree to the restoration of thoso words,
"upon the recommondation of the warden,"
so that the first part of this section Il would
read:
The Commission may, upon the recoînmendatien of the warden, appoint such guards, etc.
Before the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honouraible gentleman makes a motion, will
ho allow me te givo an explanation of the
change?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

Certainly.

I tbink that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
when my honourahie friend bas beard tbe
explanation ho will net insist upon bis arnendment. The clause as it is drafted bas for its
obj oct a complote change in the appointment
of those inferior officers, if I may eall thein
such. It was the view of the royal commission, and the Minister of Justice concurs,
that the selection of these officers sbould ho
made under an entirely new systorn. Under
that systema mon te ho appointed as ponitentiary guards will have te go through a
training course te prepare then for their
work. In England, at the Sehool of Wakcfield,
mon who desire te becorne l)onitootiary

most important and should ho welcomed in
this country. At thoe prosont time one

Commission. In the cir(urost-antes I thjnk
.section 11 shoild ot lii amended.
M\y bonourable friend may ask, -What
hiartn is there in consulting the wardens?'
H-In. Mr. TANNER,

It goes without saying that the members of
the proposed commission would make appointmoints with their eyes open. Furthermore, they
would do se witb the knowiedg-e that the
appointees had passed through a traininîg which
entitied them to preferment over applicants
fromn the outside who had neither training
nor experionce. It may be regarded as a
ciosed service, if you will, but that systemn
%vould enure to the advantage of the service
itseif, and in the (ircumstances I think my
honourable frien-d should accept the section
as drafted. Truc, the commissioners will no
longer make appoint ments on the rocommendation of the warden, but they wilI have the
advantago of rnaking their selection from men
who have been given a thorough schooiing
by well qualified and experionced instructors.
I arn confident that nlot oniy the present
Minister of Justice but those who may succeod
him in the yoars to corne will do their uitmest
to ensuro that our penitentiaries shall be
wvell manned, well organized and well dirccted.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have an answer
thiat mnay not bo wbolly satisfactory to the
bionourable leader of the House. The presenit
clauise wvas enacted six years ago. As 1 understand, it was inserted for very sound reasons
and with the virtually unaninious approval
of thi, flouse and of the House of Couinons.
I anticipated that rny honourablo friend
would tell me about the training school, but
I do ot thînk it is a sufficient aoswer to my
objection te the section as drafted. I have
no criticisio of the pro.jected school; indeed
I (-an seo that its establishment may effeot a
substantial improvement il our penitentiary
officers. But wo have to rernember whiat was
said the other day and what is, I think, an
unchallengeable fact, that the warden of a
pcnitentiary is the key man of the wbole
establishment.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: He is responsible
for the administration of the institution and
of ail its innmates, and, as the Ministor of
Justice said the othier dlay, it is a tremondous
responsibility. That need not be enlargcd upon,
for a mioment's reflection will convinco one
thiat xvîth many desperate characters under
bis charge hoe is confronted with formidable
diffl'Mîlties. If lie is a capable man you have
good administration; if flot, as the right
hionourable leader on this side of the House
says, you cannot expeet good administration.
But hionourable members will admit that ne
miatter 1mow competent hie niay ho, a wardcn
'cinnot ho expected to mako a succoss of his
,xork unlcess hoe bas competeot mon under
him-men tbat hoe cao trust, mon that hoe

MARCH 15, 1939
knows, men that he can feel safe with. That
is why this law was passed in 1933, to safeguard the warden, the institution and the
country. We have placed that heavy responsibility on the warden, and I think it is our
duty to protect him by continuing the present
safeguarding clause.
The moment the proposed legislation goes
into effect our penitentiaries will pass under
the control of three commissioners. We do
not know who the commissioners will be,
but I think it is a safe conclusion that though
they may be very able men in some respects,
they may not know anything about running
a penitentiary. They will have to learn. While
they are learning, the warden, the key man
of the penitentiary, may have all kinds of
incompetent and unsafe persons selected to
take positions under him. I do not think
the warden should be left in that precarious
state; on the contrary, he should be safeguarded, at any rate until the proposed school
has been established and has proven its
merit.
Where are these schools to be established?
How long will it take to build them up?
If we are to judge from the tardy pace in
other governmental spheres of action, it may
be months or even years before the proposed
schools not only are established, but are
able to operate on an efficient basis. In the
meantime the safeguard for the warden is
withdrawn, and he will have to take anybody
the commissioners may send to him, whether
trained or untrained. I submit to my honourable friend that that is neither fair to the
warden nor to the penitentiary system. The
only training of real value is derived from
the actual work of administering the affairs
of the penitentiary, and that training can
be given only in the penitentiary. The warden is the only man who can give the necessary instruction until the school is in full
operation.
I am not criticizing the establishment of
some kind of training school, but I say to
my honourable friend opposite that he should
not even for a month, let alone for two or
probably three months or longer, leave
penitentiary wardens exposed to the danger
which was guarded against in 1933 by the
section which it is now proposed to abrogate.
I intend to submit my amendment to the
judgment of the House, and I hope my
honourable friend will accept it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would remind
my honourable friend that the royal commission has stated that the change made in
1933, to which he has referred-granting the
warden the right to advise the superintendent
on the appointment of guards and other subordinate officers-has not worked satisfactorily.

79

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Why?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not
the text before me, but I am told that pressure was put on the wardens in some cases,
and that the men selected did not prove satisfactory.

pressure ?

Pressure of
Outside pres-

Mr. MEIGHEN:

Political

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would say
political pressure.
Now, with reference to the gap which my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Tanner) sees
between the present system and the working
out of the new system, and to the possibility
that the Commission might not be experienced, I would draw attention to the fact
that the three present inspectors will be the
assistant commissioners; so there will be continuity of experience and service. Inasmuch
as we have gone to the trouble of asking
the inquiry commissioners to study the situation, and they have suggested the system
now carried into this Bill, I think we should
be somewhat chary about amending it. Of
course we can do so, but I believe that under
the new system, the Penitentiary Commission having its eyes open, and having the
help of the assistant commissioners, who must
have had some training before they were selected, there is a complete safeguard under
the clause at it is.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think there is
any safeguard during this period of study. The
intention is to eut out the safeguard. Never,
so far as I have been able to observe during
the discussions on this Bill, has there been
a suggestion in either House that the law as
it now exists was not satisfactory. There
is no complaint that it has not worked well,
and what I protest against is the fact that
though this new system may require considerable time to devise and build up, the one
safeguard which the wardens have is now to
be eliminated.
Here is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
reconstruction of personnel, as taken from
the report of the royal commission, page
344:
Your Commissioners are convinced that the
success or failure of the recommendations contained in this report will depend almost
entirely upon the prison personnel to be
charged with carrying out the recommendations.
The success of every prison system is dependent
upon the type of officers in that system.

SENATE

80

It is herein clearly indicated that, in the
opinion of your Commissioners, it is imperative
that several officers should immediately be
retired from the service. As soon as the
Prison Commission herein recommended has
been appointed, a definite plan should be
evolved for a complete reconstruction of the
personnel on entirely new lines. Heretofore,
officers have been selected with little regard
for their ability to perform other than custodial
duties. The result has been that there are
few officers in the service who have either the
capacity or the training to exert ary reformative influence on the prisoners. They are
"guards" and nothing more.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Well, I will pass
from that. There will be no lack of candidates
of a type.
The honourable gentleman referred to the
hope that it may be possible to supply the
penitentiary with all its officers, up to the
warden, from the' intake under the new system.
I would ask if it is the intention to increase
the pay and improve the status of the service.
I assume that even this Commission will not
attempt to promote from the ranks people
who are not fit for the service.

I want to ask
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
one or two practical questions in connection
with this matter. Vacancies amongst guards
occur, not in shoals or flocks, but one at
a time. A man may fall ill, resign or be
dismissed. The intake of guards at a penitentiary would not be more than eight or
ten a year. Now, if a vacancy occurs for
any reason, and a man is required to fill
it, what is going to happen? Will the warden
be able to take a man on temporarily, or
will be have to wait until the Commission at
Ottawa move?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister of
Justice said in the other House that he
would await the work of the Commission, and
the report on such questions.

They will
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
take the graduates, I suppose, in the order
of examination results.
The answer is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that there is a list of those qualified.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Now?

And
Now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the wardens may recruit from that list in an
emergency.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
that list?

Who prepared

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The wardens
prepared the list under the law at it stands.
Assuming that
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
the list is completely exhausted, who is going
to make the appointment or the temporary
arrangement te carry on?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that it will take five or six years to exhaust
the list.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is not a
sound answer. The gentleman who advised
the honourable senator should know that an
apparently permanent list falls away. I have
had something to do with lists of that sort,
and know that you are apt to find that the
man you want has gone to California or
somewhere else, or is dead. Such a list has
to be kept up to date, and I would not attach
much importance to that answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that there is no lack of candidates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is obvious
to everybody is that a systern of promotion
from the ranks is utterly worthless unless it
ensures that people fit to be promoted go
into the ranks. So I ask, how are yeu going
to raise the qualifications of those who go
into the ranks, in order te make sure that
yeu will have the proper people to promote?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is expected
that the standard will be raised through the
training the men will get, and by reason of the
selection from among those that are trained.
All who offer will not be accepted.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Money makes the
mare go, and money produces a better type of
candidate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When my honourable friend refers to money, he means
wages?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Wages, salaries,
swag, or whatever you call it.
I come now to the school. I am thinking
of the school in England. Whom have we
sent there? A deputy wardenHon. Mr. DANDURAND: The gentleman
had been in the service before. He is not in
it now, but he knows all about the work of
the penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am speaking of
the delegation that has gone to England for
training.
Nine guards
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
have been sent for training: two from St.
Vincent de Paul, two from Kingston, and one
frorn each of the other penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We have a similar
system in military training. We have schools
giving courses al the time, but we never
dream of sending private soldiers to the
training schools. That is what you are doing
here. Am I to understand that when these
guards have taken this course of two or three

MARCH 15, 1939
months of training in England and have
returned, one of thern, say a guard frorn
Prince Albert Penitentiary, will inaugurate
the systern of training in that penitentiary,
without the consent or knowledge of the
deputy warden?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The men who
are sent are deemed to ibe the best men in the
various perntentiaries.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But they are
guards.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The lowest
straturn.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, these men
are fitted through education and experience,
and there are arnong thern some university
graduates.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If that is so,
it is a new one on me. Looking at the
question frorn the point of view od the working
of the penitentiary, I cannot conceive that a
man who is in the lowest grade in the
penitentiary can give very effective training
to others.
Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND: In each penitentiary there will be a nucleus of instructors for
the training of the men who will present
themselves.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The proper persons
to receive the training are either the wardens
or the deputy wardens, who on their return
rnay put into practice the things they have
learned.
Passing frorn that to the practical use of
all this, I may say that I entirely agree with
the idea of sehools. I concur in the hope that
you may find in your penitentiary service
rnen who are suitable for the hiighest rank;
but I know enough of this business to know
that unless you can evolve a systern which
induces the right type of men to corne into
the lower ranks, your system of promotion
will neyer work.
I corne now to the sehools. This is a very
large country, and the holding of a sehool
in any part of Canada to which candidates
would corne would be a very expensive
matter. I take it that a permanent appointment will be rnade only after a man bas been
to one of these schools. If that is so, how
does a man at New Westminster who applies
to enter the service get to the school? Is he
taken on on approbation and given the course
later, or does he take the course first?
I stated, a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
moment ago that the, men who are directing
the training will go fromn one point to another,

si

and will first see to the organization of that
nucleus of men who are to examine and train.
the local men ini the neighbourhood. Tbey
will then supervise for a time the work that
is going on there. Those itinerant instructors
will naturally have the qualifications necessary for them to act as supervisors, and it will
probably be some time before the Government decide upon a central sehool. The
schooling will take place in the penitentiaries
through the organization and supervision of
the nucleus by instructors who will go frorn
one penitentiary to another.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I quite understand that in England there is what rnight be
described as a course of instruction. A twoyear course of training in police work has
been evolved there. We have long since had
medical schools and legal schools, and I see
no reason why we should not evolve a system
of training in interior economy, reclaihation,
moral reform, and the like, in connection with
the penitentiaries; but obviously the training must corne from a person of some standing in the service. I think the capacity of a
guard to reach that standard through the
systern is extrernely slirn. However, as someone else is authorized to go from penitentiary
to penitentiary, the organization may be
slowly built Up.
That brings us to the point raised by the
honourable senator frorn Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner). Is it proposed that in the meantime this Commission in Ottawa will select
for employment these men in the lowest rank,
without the intervention of the warden?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn informed
that for the present the Commission, with the
supervision of inspectors and assistant commissioners who have been in contact with the
penitentiaries, will have to use the list that
has been prepared by the warden in each
of the penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But the honourable gentleman said that the old systeni of
preparing the lists was not a success and that
because of political interference the wardens
were not free in making their choice. There
is a list that is probably four years old-I
should not think it would be much olderand for many years to corne the selections
will be made from that list.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The list is being
added to from week to week.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I quite believe
that. Then arn I to understand that after the
passing of this 15ill the warden will have
nothing to do with the preparation of such a
list, and that the list will be kept here? How

wili the inspectors proceed wjth the graduation
of that list, or the making up of the list as
to seniority, or upon the advice of wbat local
person will the inspector here act if the
warden is eliminated?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My bonourabie
friend takes it for granted that the warden
and deputy warden will be virtually nonexistent. I cannot for a moment believe that
the assistant commissioners will flot continue
to be in contact with those officers in every
penitentiary.
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Why flot accept
the amendment that is offered?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because anotber
systemi is being proposed. If I were an
assistant cominissioner, during the so-cailed
gap between the present and the time when
Élnew systeol is funetioning perfeetiy I
xvouid utilize the best information obtainabie
from any penitentiary where a vacancy
occurred. That goes without saying.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourabie
niembers, 1 do not expect that what 1 say
xviii meet with the approval of the House,
even, and I have no confidence that it xviii
niect with the approvai of the coontry. I find
myseif totally at variance with ail this drift
of things. Whenever we have a royal comnmssion there is always somiething more
extravagant suggested. whici it is said wili
bring in the inillennium. Wi' are always going
to bave an altogcther different, day in our
officiais from tiat timie on. The new men are
to ho entirely different from the old, and
therefore the intirmities incident to our race
wiil no longer appear. but xviii be something
only of memiory. The public accepts that. I
admit. and does not fear the cost. In fact,
1 am afraid I have to confess that the public
likes to see governments spend money. The
more governmients spend, the more they
strangie business by taxation, and tbe greater
the number of poor. well-intentioned and bard%vorking people consequentiy thrown out of
enîployînent, the more likely tbey are to be
returned to power, provided of course tbey
taik long enough and loud eîsoigb about
bumnan rigbts. the larger liberties, and ail those
other tbings that tickie the ears of the grouindlin-7s. So I am not hopeful of getting anywbere on this, but if I cannot express what
is in my mind I hiad better not, be here.
I have not an iota of faith in this school
system. Nor biave, I an iota of faitb tbat

penitentiaries, starting with the heads. We
talk about a school for guards, and we are
toid there is one in England. I fancy it is
ratber a place for investigating and studying
would-be guards, to find out if tbey have tbe
requisite character. That may be practicable
in a tiglit littie island, with its institutions
right around the place wbere guards are beîng
taught, but to talk about an educationai institution for s( booiing guards in Canada seems
to me to be the very heigbt of extravagance
and fantastie nonsense. An itinerant sehool!
What subleets will be taugbt tbere? Can
anyone suggest any subject that should be
taugbt a man before hie wiil make a good
guard in a penitentiary?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Ju-jutsu.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Are they
going to be taught bow to handie bandits
witb the rigbt hand and wîth the left band,
and how mnany bandits may be led together
through corridors? Is another subjeet on the
curriculum to be about sex perverts and so
fortb? What are to be tise essential elements
of education for guards? Let us get down
to practical facts. I know a guard is better
for being intelligent, and bie is better for
having some education, but the great buik, of
people have that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
for baving training.

And hie is better

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
But the only place to train a guard is at bis
work. The idea of training a man in the
liandling of prisoners at a school bere in
Ottawa or, say, in tise Maritimes. is utter
nonsense. If you want to choose a nsan who
is likely to make a good guard, size bim up.
I xviii tell you the basis on xvbich to size
hima up, and that is bis character. The
qualities needed are ebaracter and common
sense. Any mani wbo possesses tîsese can be
a good guard; witbout tbem, no man can be.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hear,

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
give a man cbaracter and common sense by
any systemn of scbooling, no matter how
ingenious you are. You can employ many
additional people and put up anotîser building
bere at Ottawa, you can add to tbe debt of
tise country and bear down a littie more
heaviiy on tise taxpayer, but that is ail you
can do by establisliing schoois for guards. I
ask tihe leader of the Government to put bimself in the position of a w'arden. He bias
cbarge of iun.dreds of men, soime of wlîum are
desperate, or may be-it is difficuit to tell

MARCH 15, 1939
wbetber tbey are or not. His duty is to make
the best of tbem ail, to maintain tbe discipline
of bis institution.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACFI: To keep tbem
saf e.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. 11e bas
to sec tbat be does bis duty to the nation
wbicb appoints bim. A beavy duty rests upon
bim, and the instruments tbrougb wbicb be
carnies out tbat duty are these guards. Now,
if my bonourable friend were a warden, would
be not want to select bis guards from men
wbom be bas been pretty close to, wbom be
bas examined personally, wbom be bas known
for some time, and wbose families perbaps be
knows, or, at any rate, men wbom be bas bad
an opportunity of sizing up time and time
again? Would be not ratber entrust the
reputation of bis wardensbip to men so
cbosen tban to men wbo bave attended a
sebool in Ottawa and been sent out to bim
by six commissioners bere? 1 know be would,
just as well as I know be is sitting in bis seat
rigbt now. Further, be would not want
guards appointed in any other way, for be
would neyer feel saf e witb tbem.
A warden's position is a very, very re-

sponsible one. I can tbink of none whicb is
more responsible. A warden is constantly on
edge lest sometbing occur wbicb will damage
tbe reputation of bis institution and consequently of bimself. I wonder bow a warden
would feel if the men on wbom be depends,
on wbom be must depend, were to be sbipped
out to bim from some new-fangled sebool at
Ottawa or elsewbere. I do not like to be

personal, but there is sometbing I want to
say. I am speaking, of course, on my own
responsibility. I bave bad a brother in the
position of warden, and I appreciate tbe fact
tbat the references to bim in tbe royal commission's report were favourable. But I would
say tbis, that neyer in my life did I bear bim
complain that, under any government, any
pressure at all prevented bim. from selecting
good guards. And 1 cannot conceive of any
competent warden being so infiuenced at alI.
A weak man, an incompetent man, would be.
If tbat is tbe kind of man a warden is, let bim
out. But if be is a man fit for bis post, be is
neyer going to allow tbe wrong kind of guard
to be appointed under bMm. There is too
mucb at stake. Unless be bas good guards,
the first thing be knows is that he bas a riot
in bis institution, or a scandal. I stand to say
tbat if I were a warden I would rather select
my own men, even if 1 had to fire tbem or
recommend tbeir being fired witbin a week,
than be required to accept somebody just
because be bad taken some course of instruelion in a sehool.

83

Let me again emphasize that wbat a gixard
needs is character. H1e must be possessed of a
desire to belp to the best of bis ability the
men who are placed under bis care. He must
keep tbem in their place and sec that tbey do
the work expected of them, sec that tbey once
more get the notion that we are meant to
work in this world. Tbat notion had passed
out of their heads before tbey got into the
penitcntiary, and it must be regained. 1 repeat that if a man bas cbaracter and common
sense be is very likely to make a good guard.
If be bas not these qualities, ail the curricula
on earth will neyer make bim fit for bis job;
ail tbe instructors you can bring into an institution will not bclp bim one iota.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I sbould like to ask my
right bonourable friend one question. H1e
spoke about bis brotber, but I did flot quite
understand wbether be said he had neyer
heard bis brother complain.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: H1e neyer complained about any pressure, from any govcrnment, in the appointment of guards.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Do I understand the fact
is that he neyer complained, or that pressure
was neyer used in bis case?
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I tbink if
there had been pressure used be, probably
would bave told me.
Hon. Mr. COPP: 11e migbt have, or not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As to these men who
bave been sent -to the sehool in England, were
tbey guards wbo bad been employed in penitentiaries for some time?
Yes. Their
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
service in penitentiaries averaged about eigbt
years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How long bas the man
wbo was sent from tbe Manitoba penitentiary
been employed there?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only information I bave is that be was there a long
time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 11e bas been taken on
since the 15tb of October, 1935, if bis name
is correctly reported in the paper. In tbe
last Dominion election be was the chief
organizer for Mr. Maybank, in Winnipeg
,South-Centre. I know the young man very
well; be lives on the street next to me.
11e bas not been em.ployed very long.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is be a brigbt
boy?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and he bas a fine
motber too. I think bc is a university
graduate, but I am not sure of that.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

Was he a good

'on. Mr. HAIG: Yes: Mr. Maybank won
the election. I just wanted to know how
long this young man had been employed
before he was sent to England.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps he was
the brightest person available.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before we finish
with our work, I will get the information.
I would remind my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) of a statement
made by a very brilliant man, Mirabeau, at
the time of the French Revolution. He said
one day that when every body was wrong,
everybody was right. I find'that there are
schools for the training of guards in Great
Britain, Switzerland, Japan and France. Surely
all these countries cannot be wrong in establishing such schools. I will read a brief
extract from the syllabus of the Wakefield
school, which is to be found at page 348 of
the royal commission's report:
I would empliasize the fact that in these
training courses we do not attempt to produce
the complete]y trained prison officer; only time
and experience can do that.
What we do try to do is to give the man
a general broad outline of the varied duties
and responsibilities that will fall to his lotat the same time arriving at the most accurate
character assessment we can of each individual
-thereby
assuring, as far as is possible, that
only the most suitable go forward.
Finally, what do we want and look for in
the English prison officer?
First of all the
temperament must bo riglt. Many an otherwise excellent fellow is temperamentally quite
unsuitable. He worries-or alternatively cannot bother with details-he is no use to us.
We are most concerned with him as a man,
with what he is now and his outlook on life
now, rather than with his previous record or
intellectual or educational excellence. Many a
good man has already given his best in other
services.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is net
training at all. What the honourable gentleman quoted there simply means that the
guard is told what he will have te do, and
his character is investigated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On page 349
of the report is a list of thirty-nine subjects
which are included in the course of instruction.
If men who are taken on as guards are
well chosen, their efficiency will increase from
year te year with their experience. It seems
to me that the system of training guards
which has been followed in other countries
should be just as effective here. I am convinced that when a training sehool is in
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

operation there will be a better chance to
test persons applying for the position of
guard, and that wardens will have more
assurance as to the fitness of their new guards
than tbey have to-day. I am surprised that
any objection should bave been raised te
this work of instruction. After the experience
that has been obtained in other countries it
seems to me that Canada would be making
no mistake in following in their footsteps.
However, I am in the hands of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
A man would
be appointed as guard before he was sent
to the school?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
scbool would train only applicants.

The

Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Would the
school be open to anyone who wanted to
enter?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
There will be
a large number of men wanting to go to the
school. You will have to limit your admissions to men who you think will make good.
It seems to me the men should be appointed
first and sent to take the course later.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I take it for
granted that there would be some process
of eliimsination, based upon the record presented by eaci man in his application. The
best men would be chosen to take up the
course of training.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But tle training
course in England lasts two or three months.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
At the Wakefield school it lasts nine weeks.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Very well. I
take it you will establisl one school in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
each penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
lasting the same time?

No;

one in

With the course

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Nine weeks.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Let us examine
that from the practical point of view. We
will say there are three vacancies for penitentiary guards. Do you take the whole
list of applicants and put them through the
school, or do you select threc to receive the
necessary training?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I imagine they
have already been trained and are on the
waiting list.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You are going
to train everybody on the waiting list?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

MARCH 15, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Surely you cannot do that.
Those who
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
dasire to take the training will ha trained,
but a selection will be made from them.
With ail due
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
respect, what has been stated is so impracticable that I cannot accept it.
1 understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there are one hundred and twenty candidates
for positions in the Portsmouth panitentiary.
In due time they will ba notified that they
may enter the sehool for the necessary training, but only as applicants. Bafore being
appointed they must agrea to follow that
course.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We will say that
at Portsmouth penitantiary thera are six
vacancies. Does the honourabla gentleman
seriously tell me that a nine-week training
course will be given to thosa one hundred
and twenty applicants if they ask for it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my bonourable friend is not under the impression
that that procedure will be followed where
there are on]y six vacancies. Candidates will
be trained from year to year, and there will
be a waiting list of thosa who have been
declared fit to enter the penitentiary service.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think 1 know
axactly how it will be done. In fact it is the
only way in whieh it can be donc. 'Tha warden
will recommend to the commissioners that soand-so and so-and-so be given temporary
employment, to be made permanent on the
passing of some examination. That is how it
-will be done; let there ha no dalusion about
it. To suggest that ahl the applicants, unless
thay ara unamployad, will be able to davote
nine weeks' time to the schooling, does not
hold water. In the long run, 1 arn confident,
you will find it is the warden who bas made
the racommendation.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Doas the
honourable gentleman say that the departmant
-will train the hundred and twenty men, or
-will the scheme that bas been suggested ha
,adopted?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thosa one hun.dred and twventy applicants will ha asked if
they want to take that training, and those
-who accept will go through a nine-week course.
They will have to ha takan care of through
the instructors.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-,STAUNTON: How are
-you going to bouse thosa men in the mean-time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thay liva in
-Kingston.

b

Hon. Mr. CALDER: 1 do flot intend to
argue for or against the proposed sehool. It
should be ail right. There is much that a
guard can learn before he ever gets on the
job, but the main consideration is his character. A man of virtually no education can
be a first-elass guard if he is of the right type.
But this interregnum bothers me a good deal.
It will take the commission a considerable
time to make its rules and regulations and
get its machinery at work. In view of that,
if we cannot accept the proposition of the
honourable member fromn Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), would it not be advisable to strike
out the word "guards," ]eaving the rest of
the section as it is drafted? Let the commission appoint trade instructors and other
subordinate officers. But the warden cannot
bc ail over the institution, and the guard is
bis instrument. The guard is everything in a
penitentiary. Let hirn stili be appointad upon
the recommendation of the warden.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to this
fact. At the present time there is a waiting
list prepared by each warden. During the
interregnurn vacancias can be filled fromn that
waiting list. The inspactors of to-day will be
the assistant commissioners to-morrow, and
they are in contact with every penitentiary.
They can select the best men from that list.
I do not doubt that if the. warden says he
knows personally the man who is third, or
first, on the list, that statement will be a
factor. But 1 think we are conjuring up
difficulties that will neyer arise.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have been connected
with the Civil Service one way or another for
mazy years, and I think I know civil servants
,rom A to Z. At the present time no man
can be appointed except upon the recomnmendation of the warden, but once the commissioners themselves are appointed, and the
old section is no longer operative, you will
have an entireiy differant situation. My suggestion would be that for a period of one year,
or until such time as the new rnachinery is
in operation, no guard should be appointed
except on the recommendation of the wardan.
Thera is likely to be an intarregnum of at
least six months before the new machinery
can be brought into operation.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Act will corne
into force by proclamation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But it will be necessary to appoint yeur commissioners at a
comparativaly early period, so they rnay get
to work without delay. It see.ms to me that
the point raised by the honourable senator
from Pictou is well worth consideration, and

8(j

SENATE

that we sbeuld protect the warden with respect
to the appointment of guards until such time
at least as the proposed machinery is in full
operation.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Some of us are wondering just how wo sbould vote on this matter.
Personally, if 1 were to be guided entirely
by tbe discussion, I should be inclined te
support the amendment, but I think there is
more involved than appears on the surface.
The right honoîirable leader opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meiglien) very frankly bases bis
criticism n ot perhaps se inuch on the clause
in que. tien as on tbe whole sebeme of the
Bill. He bas net mucba faith in tbe basic
principle of appeintiog the proposed commissien. There is always danger in app]ying
amendments on tbat basis, as I learned from
an unfertunate experience some years ago.
1 bad occasion te introduce a liquor 'bill in
the Legfislature of British Columbia. I tried
te, modify it larg-ely te meet the views of tbe
probibitionists, and incorporated certain previsiens wbicb were benestly presented, but,
from our standpeint, were net consistent witb
the scbeme of tbe Bill at ail. I take it the
Minister of Justice, after careful consideration
of the report of tbe royal commission whicb
investig-ated our penitentiaries, býas presented
tbis Bill te give effeet te their recommendatiens. If se, it seems te me logical te start
on tbc assumptien that the propesed legishatien is sound, and tbat tbe details sheuld nut
be interfered witb so as te destrey its effect.
I sympathize with the proposai ef tbe honourable senator frem Pictou, but I submit it is
meeonsistent witb the scheme of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
incensistent?

How is it

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Because the scheme of
tbe Bill is te place responsibility on the
commission te work eut the neýw system.
I fail te sec mucb diffieulty during any interregnum. Though it xviii ne longer ba compulsory for appeintments of guards and other
subordinate efficers te be made upen the
recemmendation of the warden, there is ne
good reason wby the cemmissieners should
net accept such recommendatien te the fulleat
extent during whatever period may hae nacessary bafore the naw macbinary is functioning.
1 think we may assume tbat tba cemmissieners
te be appointad wili act inteliigently during
the interragnum.

when hie approved of this law. He said:
"I have the responsibility. I want to see
that the law is carried out. I want ta see
that the penitentiaries are properly managed."
Therefore hie voted for the law that I arn

and on Tuesday the Special Railway Committee will devote the whole morning and
afternoon to its inquiry.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: It
occurs to me that if the Senate does not meet
until 8 o'clock on Tuesday night our Special
Railway Committee may find itself without
some of its members when it convenes at halfpast ten in the morning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have asked
miembers of the committee if they will be
here on Tuesday morning, and 1 find that
they will be.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then that is
ail right. I shall be here myseif.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: May I intervene
to inform the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that three or four
members of the Special Railway Committee
are aLso members of -the Divorce Committee.
which committee is also sitting on Tuesday
morning.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: We shall get
to the Railway Committee aIl right.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It would be a'pity
if those members, being engaged on the
Divorce Committee Tuesday morning, could
not attend the Raîlway Committee. To meet
their convenience, why flot call the Special
Railway Committee for Wednesday and
Thursday mornings?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A difference of one
day.
Hon. Mr. BEAUB1IEN: Yes. We have very
few witnesses, and we could easily notify thein
to appear on Wednesday instead of Tuesday.
It seems ta me it would aoccommodate everybody much better if we called the Special
Railway Committee for Wednesday mornîng.
There is noa special reason for proceeding on
Tuesday morning.
Hon, C. W. ROBINSON: In view of the
fact that the Special Railway Committee is to,
meet on Tuesday morning at 10.30, and we
want to attend, we have arranged ta cali the
Divorce Committee together that morning at
9.30. We think that by meeting an hour earlier
than usual we shall be able to finish our
business and attend the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is no doubt
it will he a hardship to the members of the
Divorce Committee if they are flot able to
complete their business in time ta attend the
Special Railway Committee. I have inquired,
and am informed there is no particular reason

SENATE
why our Railway Committee should proceed
on Tuesday norning. We might just as well
resume on Wednesday morning.
lon. Mr. MURDOCK: We decided in the
Railhay Committee that we would meet on
Tuesday morning.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then let it stand
in that way.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No. Why can we
not agree to sit on Wednesday morning
instead?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Because we are not
the Special Railway Comnittee, and that committee decided to meet on Tuesday morning.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My friend is much
too particular about the rules in this instance.
He is not always such a stickler in other
respects. I am speaking in the interest of
everybody. No one has given me any reason
why the Railway Committee should sit on
Tuesday morning. We might as well proceed
on Wednesday morning.
Right Hon. Mr. MFIGHEN: It is quite
true we are not in the Railway Committee and
could not decide anything anyway, but if
we were in that committee we ought to keep
in mind the fact that we have two witnesses
for Tuesday morning, one of whom comes
from as far as Calgary. Doubtless he has
made arrangements to be here on that day,
and I do not think we have sufficient reason
to wire him not to come until next day. The
same applies, though with less force, to the
man from Kingston. As I understand from
the Whips, the members can be here on Tuesday morning, and it would seem to me,
notwithstanding the forceful argument of my
friend to the right (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), we
ought to go ahead as arranged.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then it will be
understood that the members of the Special
Railway Committee will meet at half past
ten on Tuesday morning, and that the Senate
will meet only in the evening, in order that
the committee may devote the whole day to
the railway inquiry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

All right.

The motion was agreed te.
PRICE SPREADS-REMEDIAL
MEASURES
INQUIRY

POSTPONED

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Sauvé:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. Is it a fact that the Government have
taken steps to redress the abuses mentioned in
the report of the royal investigating commisHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

sion appointed by a resolution of the House
of Commons on February 2, 1934, with power
to seek and examine the causes of the wide
spread between the price received by the producer for his goods and the price paid by the
consumer for the said goods; also to study the
system of distribution of farm produce and
other natural products, and manufactured
products, etc., in Canada?
2. If so, what measures were taken in that
respect?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman's question covers the activities of
more than one department, and it will take
some time, I presume, to secure an answer.
Honourable members of the Senate have only
to read the question to see what it involves.
The inquiry stands.
UNITED

KINGDOM-UNITED STATES
TRADE AGREEMENT
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. SAUVE inquired of the Government:
1. Have the Government of Great Britain
conferred with the Canadian Governnent with
regard to the conditions of the recent agreement between the United Kingdom and the
United States of America, particularly with
regard to those which might directly or
indirectly affect the preferences granted our
country by the Ottawa agreements of 1932?
2. Have the Government given their approval
to such conditions?

at the request of the United States?
5. In considering such conditions or concessions, have the Governîment of Great Britain
pointed out the importance of the United
States of America as a military ally?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer to
this question is fairly long; so I shall simply
place it on Hansard.
1. The arrangements agreed upon between
the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of
such modifications of the Canada-United Kingdom Trade Agreement as were required to
permit the conclusion of their respective trade
agreements with the United States of America
are set forth in the exchange of letters on
November 16, 1938, between the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom and the

was tabled as an annexed document to the
Canada-United States Trade Agreement.
2. Answered by No. 1.
3. All trade agreements involve reciprocal
concessions and undertakings by the parties
to the negotiations.
4. Answered by No. 3.
5. No.

MAROR 16, 1939K
CANADA'S PARTICIPATION

IN WAR

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. SAUVE inquired of the Government:
1. Has Canada ever participated in a war
outside hier frontiers without the Goveroment
having beforehand been authorized to, that
effeet by Parliament?
2. If so, in what year?
3. In what year did Canada particîpate in
a war for the first time with the authorization
of Parliament? How many times subsequently?
The answer to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this inquiry also wiil appear in Hansard.
1, 2, and 3. Armed forces raiscd by the
Canadian Government have participated in
operations against the opposing bellig1erents
in the theatre or theatres of war in the
South African War of 1899-1902 and in the
European War of 1914-1918.
On October 31, 1899, volunteer forces raised
by the Canadian Government were despatched
from Canada and took part in the field
operations of the South African War. This
action was taken under the authority of an

Order in Counicil of October 14, 1899. Subsequent Orders in Counicil of November 4, 1899,
and January 5, 1900, authorized expenditures,
by way of Governor General's warrants, for
"sending the contingents of Canadian volunteers to Souîth Africa, or in connection therewith." At the next session of Parliament,
which opened on February 1, 1900, these
appropriations and the expenditures thereunder were ratified and confirmed, and the
persons concerned were indemnified from
liability, by "An Act to provide for the expenses of the Canadian volunteers serving
Her Majesty in South Africa," assented to
April 4, 1900.
From August 1, 1914, at the outbreak of
the European War, the Canadian Government
took varions measures, naval, miiitary and
civil, in anticipation of or consequent upon
the belligerent status of Canada. These
measures, taken under the authority of Orders
in Council and otherwise, were ratified by
Parliament by the War Measures Act, 1914;
and the War Appropriation Act, 1914, authorized expenditures for "the defence and security
of Canada," for "the conduet of naval and
military operations in or bcyond Canada,"
and for other purposes in consequence of the
existence of the state of war-both Acts being
assented to on August 22, 1914. The first
contingent of the Canadian Expeditionary
Force sailed from Canada on October 3. 1914.

YOUTH TRAINING MOVEMENT
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, a Miniister of the Crown
yesterday called in question certain statements
1 made in this House, and aithough his attention lîad previously been directed to the fact
that to do so was contrary to the rules of
the Chamber in which hce spoke, hie procceded
to rebuke me. I deem it my right and my
duty under the circumstances to refer to what
lie said and to what I said, and to leave the
Huse to judge whether ho was within his
rights in the attack hie made upon me.
I doubt very
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
much that it is an attack; in fact. if 1 had
hiad the statement I would have nmade it here
in order to, allow my righlt honourable friend
to answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend would not hiive made the statement which was made. Ho is not that type
of mnan.
The statement was thisHon. Mr. MURDOCK: What page, pîcase?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Page 2083.
I want to take exception to what was said
by the leader of the opposition in the other
House a f ew days ago with respect to the
youth training programme.
Then the interruption took place on the
point of order, but hie proceeded:
At ail events it has been stated by one who
ought to know better, regardless of where hE
now is, that ont of those receiving training
under the youth training programme -only
twenty-five were actuaily placed in employment. I want to make it clear that the refer.
ence as it appeared in the irecord was confined
to, the province of Quebec; but I hoid in my
band an article appearing in the Vancouver
Sun which makes no reference to this placement of twenty-five persons as having occurred
within any single province. The suggestion is,
and there must have been some warrant for
it, that this was an indictmnent of the entire
youth training programme. As a matter of
f act under that national programme some 3,282
were piaced in employment, which is a very
different story f rom 25.
It does seem to, me, reverting to, what I
said in the begînning in regard to careiessness
in the presentation of information of this kind,
that those who hoid positions of high authority
as eider statesmen ought at least to take the
trouble to ascertain the f acto before they make
statements of this kind.
I now read the statement I made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honoura-ble friend allow me? I had read,
flot the officiai. report of the speech in the

90

SENATE

other House, but simply a press report, as to
the figures bcing somewhat different from
those given by my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: After having
in a very brief way referred to the youth
training movement and the enticing character
of the literature in its support, I expressed
my disappointment when I came to the
figures. Then the only words of mine that
are pertinent, words that are in no way
qualified or affected by anything else I said,
are at page 62 of the Debates of the Senate:
In my honourable friend's provinceI was referring to the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
-the numbers trained ran into the thousands
-I
cannot be certain of the number of
thousands. Will anyone attempt to guess how
many of those trained got positions? If honourable members can stand the shock, I will
tell them. There were twenty-five!
It will be noted that at the time I did not
state the number of thousands. I now come
to the figures, which are given in a pamphlet
entitled "Training Canada's Young Unemployed," publishcd by the Department of
Labour. This is the publication I was referring
to. On page 24 honourable members will find
a statement as to the number of persons in
every province who were given training. I
mentioned only the province of Quebec, for
which the figures are as follows:
Given training:
Mien.. .. ..............
13,542
Women.. .. ............
6,853
Total..

and Surgeons was instituted by a statute
passed in 1929. Under subsection 2 of section
8 the qualifications for a candidate wishing to
take examinations and become a fellow of the
college were set out. He was required to be a
graduate of not less than three years' standing
of a medical school or university approved by
the Medical Council of Canada. Section 2 of
this Bill extends eligi'bility to licentiates of the
Medical Council.
The second is the important section. For
some time medical men throughout Canada
have felt that those desiring to become
specialists in their profession should be given
an opportunity of taking an examination to
prove their qualifications to practise their
specialty. Heretofore, many of our men who
engage in special practice have had to go
abroad to secure diplomas certifying that they
had demonstrated their proficiency by passing
certain examinations. It is proposed by the
various medical councils of the provinces that
such examinations should be conducted by the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons.
The college bas no teaching staff and does not
confer degrees.
The next section provides for the holding of
examinations and the granting of special
certificates.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Is the college
nation-wide in its scope, and is it accepted
by its members as representative of the
medical profession? My information is not
quite definite in this regard. Are all physicians and surgeons members of this institution,
or is it supported by certain individuals in each
province? In a word, what sort of body is it?

I call attention only to the fact that the
Minister, after acknowledging, as he was
compelled to do, that my words referred to
Quebec alone, sought by indirection to lay
upon me responsibility for an error which he
asserted was made by the Vancouver Sun,
and thereafter proceeded to indict me as one
who made public statements irrespective of
truth. I use the most moderate of language:
his conduct was far from creditable.

Hon. Mr. KING: As I have said, the
college was incorporated by statute in 1929.
Subsection 2 of section 8 of the Act of
incorporation provides:
All candidates wishing to be examined in
either the Englishs or the French language, for
fellowship in the College shall be graduates of
not less than three years' standing of a Medical
School or University approved by the Couneil,
and shall hold licence to practise medicine in
at least one of the provinces of Canada.

PRIVATE BILLS

It is desired to repeal this subsection and
substitute for it subsection 2 as set out in
the Bill.

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill J, an Act to amend an Act to
incorporate the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, may I be
allowed to make a few remarks in explanation
of this Bill. The Royal College of Physicians
Hois. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Can the honourable member state off-hand the number of
fellows of the college and from what provinces
they come?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have a long list here.
I should say that at the present time there
are about five or six hundred fellows from al

MARCH 16, 1939
over Canada; for instance, I notice they come
from Manitoba, British Columbia, Quebec,
New Brunswick.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill K, an Act to incorporate the Board of
American Missions of the United Lutheran
Church in America (Canada).
He said: Briefly, the objects of the corporation are to carry on in the Dominion of

Canada the Home Mission and Church Extension work of the United Lutheran Church
in America.

The construction of churches and parsonages
in Canada has been financed to a large extent
by loans to the various congregations from the
Board of American Missions of the United
Lutheran Church in America (one of the
constituent administrative boards of the
United Lutheran Church in America), and the
moneys so advanced have been secured by
mortgages on the various church properties in
Canada, held in part by individuals in trust
for the American Mission Board. This is an
unsatisfactory arrangement, and the incorporation of the new body will enable these
mortgages to be made direct to the new corporation, which will, of course, require mortmain licences in the various provinces.
In addition it is contemplated that the new
Canadian corporation will enable the Church
to gather together all its work in the Dominion of Canada and will make it possible, if and
when occasion arises in the future, to transfer
the administration of the Church in Canada
from American to Canadian citizens by replacing the American citizens on the board with
Canadian citizens.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I should like to have been
able to study this Bill more thoroughly than
I have done. It seems to me extraordinary
in some particulars. It appears there is in the
United States a corporation known as the
Board of American Missions of the United
Lutheran Church in America, and the members of that board-apparently at least-are
those who apply for this charter. The members of the executive committee are specifically
named in clause 1, and are declared, by this
and by a subsequent clause as well, to be
directors of the corporation in Canada. I
speak subject to correction, but I know of no
instance of Parliament having ever incorporated a Canadian company without a single
Canadian citizen or British subject being a
director of the company.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

91
One of the mem-

bers lives in Kitchener; the last-named on
the list.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes; the
Rev. John Schmieder, of Kitchener, Ontario.
Section 3 reads as follows:
The affairs of the corporation shall be managed by a board of directors consisting of not
more than twenty-one members who shall be
appointed by the American corporation at such
time and place and in such manner as said
American corporation may from time to time
determine and who shall hold office during the
pleasure of the American corporation.
So, even though at the present time there may
be one Canadian in the corporation, and
though possibly, not certainly, by the second
sentence of clause 3, he may be included in
those constituting the first board of directors,
he might be removed immediately, and thereafter the American board could appoint directors for all time.
Hon. Mr. KING: They indicate in their
brief to me that that is not their intention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may
be so. but Parliament does not know their
intention. We are granting an American corporation rights to direct the affairs of a
Canadian corporation for all time.
Then in the body of the Bill rights are
granted in respect of real estate; rights which
I think are extraordinary, though I speak
with some reservation. It is true that by
section 7 one of the purposes of the acquirement and enjoyment of such property by
the corporation will be educational or eleemosynary, but they may also invest their
money in Canada, and they may acquire real
estate or other property and dispose of it as
they wish. Even rights in mortmain are, by
section 10, altered to comply with the requirements of this corporation.
I ask the members of the Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills to scrutinize very
carefully the sections of this Bill. I do hope
they will obtain the advice of Parliamentary
Counsel. I have not been able to see him
on the subject at all. I think the greatest care
should be taken before the Bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am glad the
right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has drawn the attention of members
of the committee to the points which he deems
should be very carefully considered. I am
not in a position at the moment to give an
opinion on the number of Canadians required
on a board of directors, and their tenure of
office, but our Parliamentary Counsel can
advise the committee on the matter.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
With the leave
of my riglit honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighien) and of the Sonate, I would
ask that we consider the second reading of
this Bill now. so that if it nicets with the
favour of the Senate it may go to Conimittee
of the Whole to-meorrow. The Bill lias been
distributed. I move second reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable mermbers, the examination I have
been able to give this Bill has been of the
most cursory kind, because I have been
sitting in the Special Committee on Railways
ail day. From what I have seen of the
measuro, not only do I not like it, but it
seems to me to be a continuation in
aggravated form of the course pursued in this
country, in soie degree under ail governmonts, but in a mîost appalling degree under
this Government, of appointing more public
officiais and creating a more and more
extensive and expensive bureaucracy for every
imaginable thing that has to be donc. I
gather from this Bill thatHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am very
sorry to interrupt, but I thought my right
honourable friend would allow me to explain
the Bill first.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought my
honourable friend was not going to explain it.
I shall be only too glad to have him explain.
I am happy that I am net required to explain
it myself.

MARCH 21, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is only with
my right honourable friend's good will that I
may proceed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Al right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If honouraible
members will read the explanatory note
opposite the first page of the Bill itself, they
will see the full purport of this proposed
legislation. The note says:
The purpose of the Bill is to co-ordinate the
film activities of the various government departments, with a view to securing quality,
economy and efficiency in the production and
distribution of government films.
It is proposed to establish a board of eight
members, with the Minister of Trade and
Commerce as chairman, another member of the
Government, three members selected f rom
persons outside the permanent civil service and
three members of the permanent civil service.
The chief executive officer will be a commissioner, who, under the direction of the board,
will supervise and direct government film
activities. He will be the only additional paid
official.
An advisory committee, comprising a representative of each department engaged in film
activities, will also be appointed, under the
chairmanship of the commissioner. Its main
concern will be the organization of a central
government film distribution and public information service. There will be no interference
with commercial film organizations.
The Canadian Government Motion Picture
Bureau will remain under the Department of
Trade and Commerce and will be the depository
of all government films which are to be distributed by the central government film distribution service.
As honourable senators know, moving
pictures have become an important factor in
our social life and are second only to the radio
in popular appeal. They have already largely
supplanted the theatre. The films produced
by our Motion Picture Bureau, informative,
educational and recreative, are used mainly
for publicity purposes.
The bureau has been in operation for some
years and is under the direction of the
Department of Trade and Commerce. It is
well equipped and well manned, and is doing
excellent work. Five or six other government
departments have similar branches, but they
have very little equipment of any value.
Sometimes they use the films produced by
the bureau, but mostly they supply their
needs through private sources.
It is the
purpose of this Bill to co-ordinate these various
activities, thus preventing overlapping. At
present each department is self-contained and
does not know what is going on in other
departments.
The Bill provides that all
requests for films shall be approved by the
National Film Board. As I have said, the
board will be composed of eight members,
including two Ministers, the chairman being
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, three

93

civil service officials, and three outsiders. It
goes without saying that the two Ministers
and the three officials will cost the country
nothing as members of the board. Two of the
outsiders may be selected as representative of
the press, the radio, or the universities, and
there will probably be a motion picture
specialist.
The duties of the board and of its executive
officers are to be found in clauses 6 and 9.
Clause 6 reads:
The Board shall discharge such duties as the
Governor in Council may request it to undertake, and particularly, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, review Government film activities and advise the Governor
in Council in connection therewith.
Clause 9 will give honourable members an
idea of what is expected of the commissioner.
I will read the section:
The Commissioner in carrying out the duties
imposed upon him by this Act shall at all times
be under and subject to the directions of the
Board and shall
(a) advise upon the making and distribution
of national films designed to help Canadians in
all parts of Canada to understand the ways
of living and the problems of Canadians in
other parts;
(b) co-ordinate national and departmental
film activities in consultation with the Board
and the several departments and branches of
Government work;
(c) advise as to methods of securing quality,
economy, efficiency and effective co-operation in
the production, distribution and exhibition of
Government films;
(d) advise upon and approve production, distribution and exhibition contracts and agreements in connection with film activities of the
several departments of the Government and,
in respect of these, act as intermediary between
such departments and the Bureau and between
such departments and commercial firms;
(e) advise upon all departmental expenditures in the production, distribution and exhibition of films;
(f) represent the Board in its relations with
commercial newsreel and non-commercial film
organizations;
(g) advise as to the distribution of Government films in other countries;
(h) co-ordinate and develop information services in connection with Government film
activities.
There will be also an interdepartmental
committee as provided by section 13.
The section reads:
(1) There shall be a committee, hereinafter
called "the Committee," which shall consist of
the Commissioner, the Director, and one representative of each Government department engaged in film activities, to be appointed by
the Board, on the recommendation of such
departments.
(2)'Members of the Committee other than
the Commissioner shall be departmental officers
directly interested in the production and distribution of departmental films.

SENATE
(3) The duties of the Committee shall be
to advise the Director in the development of
a central Government filin distribution service
and a public information service in regard
thereto.
(4) The Commissioner shall be the Chairman
of the Committee and it will report through
him to the Board.
(5) No fees or emoluments of any kind shall
be payable to or received by any member of
the Committee in connection with services
rendered as such member, but members shall
be paid actual travelling and living expenses
necessarily incurred in connection with the
business of the Committee.
The bureau will see to the distribution, both
in Canada and abroad, of films that are under
its control, and it may prepare films to
increase the knowledge abroad of the resources
and possibilities of our country, as well as
films for the instruction of our own people
and the cultural development of children and
students. National films appealing to Canada
at large will be different from the departmental films at present prepared, which concern only the activities of a department.
I would say that the National Film Board
will be the initiator of ideas to be carried out
oy the Motion Picture Bureau, which will
continue to be a productive factor.
My right honourable friend has indicated
that this is one of those formulas which have
become somewhat popular in governmental
activities, under his own Government as well
as under the one in which I have a certain
responsibility.
It may be that there are
boards whose usefulness may be contested,
but that does net mean that all are in that
class, or that one proposal by itself may not
stand the test of examination and criticism
by members of Parliament. Notwithstanding
the fear expressed by my right honourable
friend. this board-of which the commissioner
and his secretary will be the only paid
officials-comes, I think, at a proper time in
the administration of the country and its
general activities. We must all realize that
there are modern inventions which are of
considerable importance. Here are motion
pictures which will play an important role
throughout the world in advertising Canada.
its products, its activities, and its scenic
beauties. Films will be distributed in many
countries for the purpose of creating a faveurable impression of Canada and Canadian
goods.
Heretofore we have had a Government
Motion Picture Bureau under the Department
of Trade and Commerce. Other departments
also have been using films for their own benefit. It is thought that the time has come
when, in the general interest of Canada, the
work of various departments in this field
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

should be co-ordinated under a national
bureau. I feel that there is a place for the
creation of such an institution as is proposed
in this Bill. If my right honourable friend
will simply bear in mind the possibilities of
development in this sphere, he will, I think,
admit that the Bill is well prepared and well
balanced, that what is proposed will net be
costly, and that it will bring together all those
departments that are interested in film production.
My riglt honourable friend may ask, "What
have we spent on the Motion Picture Bureau
in the Department of Trade and Commerce?
What shall we spend in the future? Will not this
organization develop considerably? What will
it become? Such an organization generally
starts with the chief of the branch and a
secretary, but a few years later we find them
surrounded by a large staff." Such, of course,
is possible. and no doubt it bas occurred. If
my right honourable friend were to ask me
wvhat the effect of the Bill would b, I should
say it would have the effect of preventing
overlapping. If he were to ask me to guarantee that bere should be no increase in the
vote for this work, I would refrain, because
it may become necessary to do some things
which would make an increase unavoidable.
In view of the role whicb films now play
throughout the world, I am convinced that
we should put our house in order and prepare
to take advantage of the development of
this invention. If my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) were here.
he could tell of what he saw in going from
town te town in France and Belgium, and
couild speak of the important part played by
films which were displaved in the public
squares. Canada is making use of films to
a considerable extent. as I shall be able to
show to-morrow if the Bill gets its second
reading to-night. and I am convinced that
this is an activity which will develop more
and more.
Under these circumstances I have no hesitancy in saying that I believe this is good
legislation. One must have a forward outlook and must think of what Canada stands
for. We should realize the possibilities of
this method of bringing about a better understanding among the various provinces and
the various peoples who inhabit this country.
Through this organization the work will be
carried along on scientific lines and without
overlapping, not only in Canada, but also
in other countries of the world.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. I think I can banish from
my mind the prejudice I have against motion
pictures and can discuss the Bill as if that

MARCH 21, 1939
prejudice had never existed. Nothing so irritates me as to see a motion picture, though
better people than I like them, and I do not
doubt that they occupy a considerable place
in the interest of the world at the present
time.
I am opposed to this Bill. I am opposed
to the whole tendency of which the Bill is a
part. I question very much that in foreign
lands these films are so important to Canada
as the Minister depicts them. What I protest against most is this: the Government
seem to be of opinion that just as soon as
they are able to show that something is worth
producing, then it is the business of the
Government to produce it. How does this
follow? If it is the business of the Government to go into film production, why
not go into automobile production? Automobiles are worth producing too.

Canada abroad-and I do not think that is a
very important objective, for it ranks seventh
or eighth in the list of rather laboriously produced objectives of the new board-is this the
best way to do it? The first objective of the
board is to:

How familiar this language is! Honourable
members will please listen and each say to

something just like it? Is this not just the

of national films designed to help Canadians
in all parts of Canada to understand the ways
of living and the problems of Canadians in
other parts.

This is just another product of weakness in

when the film business was started.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It may be my

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Sir George Foster had
a lot to do with it.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not
start this business. And if I had my life to
live over again, no government that I was in
would start half of what they did start. But
I know that in 1932-33 our vote was $45,000,
and last year it was $150.000. That shows
how the thing Pas been growing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it is not on

So thev come here and

ask us to put lirough a Bill, to build up
another board and appoint another commissioner. I supppose that two or three sessions
from now this commissioner will be expanded
into two or three commissioners. The Government are not strong enough to pass an Order

changed into triplication, and thus, we are
told, money is to be saved and efficiency
promoted. Thcy want a board to "co-ordinate" - magnificent word! - all the different
film-producing facilities, and to advise here,
there and everywhere. I ask honourable
members to look over the list of duties of
this proposed board and observe how often the
giving of advice is included. I have already
read the first clause in this list of duties. and
I will proceed with the others:
(b) co-ordinate national and departmental
film activities in consultation with the board
and the several departnents and branches of
governmnent work;
(c) advise as to methods of securing quality,
economy, efficiency and effective co-operation-Riglt lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Where have I heard that before?
-in the production, distribution and exhibition
of government films;
(d) advise upon and approve production,
distribution and exhibition contracts and agreements in connection with film activities of the
several departments of the Government and,
in respect of these, act as intermediary between
such departments and the bureau and between
such departments and commercial firms;
(e) adviseThere is that word again.
-upon
all departmental expenditures in the
production, distribution and exhibition of films;
(f) represent the board in its relations with

organizations.
That is six duties I have read.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
more.

There are two

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is only
one among those I have read which even
indicates what the people of the country are
going to get out of this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the last two clauses-

If you will read

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am going to
read them in a minute. Only the first clause,
se far, has given us any objective. The
purpose of all this expenditure and new
bureaucracy

is to sec that Canadians

in the

East understand Canadians in the West, or
that the people of Quebec understand the
people of Ontario-as if they already did not.
Then there is another objective:
(g) advise as to the distribution of Government filins in other countries.
I could conceive of some value in the
distribution of films as regards Canada in
other countries-for I suppose people abroad
attend showings as Canadians do-if Canada
were in the advertising business for any
purpose which advertising can serve.
One
could understand the use of films to draw
attention te this country and direct people
here if, for instance, Canada were seeking
immigrants. Maybe she ought to be, but I
know she is not, for there is nothing more
difficult than to get past our immigration walls.
I am not discussing the merits of the existing
policy now. On that matter I differ with some
persons with whom I am very friendly. But,
as we all know, we are not seeking immigrants
from anywhere; we are placing almost every
possible obstacle in the way of anyone's
coming here. We seem to think that this
ought to be a close preserve for ourselves"We, Us and Company "-through all eternity
-and without much necessity of defence on
our part either. In these circumstances, what
good can films do? What practical object is

MARCH 21, 1939
served by this advertising? Are the merits of
Canadian goods, as contrasted with foreign
goods, advertisable by films? No film that
I ever saw-I have seen only about fourwould be of any use.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: You cannot judge
from four.

the life out of this country.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Can anybody
imagine how a film would show that a Canadian product is superior to another product,
or that a Canadian product sells cheaper? It
may be lack of imagination on my part, but
I cannot see how a film is able to serve that
purpose: Consequently I do not know what
in the world is the practical purpose of these
film exhibitions in other lands. I could see
the value in having our films abroad if we
had a virile immigration policy, but so long as
we have no such policy I think the distribution of films abroad is a waste of money.
On the board there are to be two Ministers,
who are to have special functions for this
purpose. The likely result will be sooner
or later an extra Minister in the Cabinet.
Three members of the board are to be brought
from outside, and there will be added three
civil servants. That is a board of eight, plus
the commissioner. The leader of the Government says members of the board are not to
be paid. I see that in the Bill. But have
we not had experience of men who i.eceive
no pay being more expensive than those who
are paid? I think I could indicate instances
where such bas been the case. I cannot

on in one department by servants of this
country already paid, and well paid. I suggest
a still better course. If we have to use films-

imagine7 men taking honorary positions for
the sake of the proud satisfaction of serving
a struggling nation by superintending its films.
The work of this board would not be of a
kind from which a man would get some satisfaction for volunteering his services, for the
board is not one that would obviously be of
any help in a crisis. Why are those men going
on the board if they do not expect to get
something for their services? Remember, I
am not saying men will not work for the
country for nothing; they will. But I cannot
imagine why anybody would go on the film
board with three civil servants for the honour
in it. You will have to pay the expense of
bringing these people from the ends of the
country, and your outlays of various kinds
for secretaries and other employees will add
considerably to taxation. In addition you

will have this film commissioner. Worst of
all, you will have laid the foundation for a
superstructure which will rise just as surely
as the sun will rise to-morrow morning, and
by the raising of such superstructures in this,
that and the other field you add to the great
mountain of taxation that to-day is crushing

I am surprised

that the head of the Department of Trade
and Commerce, ordinarily a practical manmore practical, I think, than a Cabinet Minister usually is-is yielding to this importunity. If the Government are bound to be
in this business, all they have to do is issue
an Order in Council directing that it be carried

though for the life of me I cannot see any

sufficient purpose to be served by so doingwe can get them the way the Government
get anything else, by tender and contract.
Let the Government attend to their own
affairs, and let business attend to the affairs
of industry.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I am entirely in accord with the views
expressed by the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I can
speak with some knowledge of film production, for in the latter years of the war, as

Director

of Organization, I was connected

with the preparation of war films. From
the experience I then gained I say advisedly

that this is a very technical business. If
honourable members entertain any doubts on
that point, it is only necessary to recall
the salaries paid and the other expenses incurred by the film business of America.
Our war films were not very successful, and
they certainly involved us in a world of

trouble. We did not know very much about
the film business. and I take it the commission which it is proposed to appoint will be
rqually unfamiliar with its complexities. The

Bill provides for the appointment of a commissioner, to be known as the Government
Film Commissioner. I doubt if you could
get a competent commissioner under a salary
of $25,000. On the other hand, you might
get a man for $3,000. He will have to have
a staff to assist him. As the right honourable
leader on this side bas pointed out, all these,
institutions have a tendency to grow. The
importance of departments is gauged by the
number of their staffs. It is always a struggle
to keep staffs down, for of course the man
in charge is interested in enlarging his department, and thereby increasing his own importance, with the probability of securing larger
compensation. The right honourable gentleman lias not exaggerated at all in picturing
the growth which you may well expect if
you establish a commission for film production. That is about the last thing the
Government should undertake. There is no
industry more technical.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Government have
been in it for yoars.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Well, they have made
no very great success of it, and the fact that
the Government have been in the business
for years is no reason why they sboîîld continue in it if it hias nlot proved successful. I
have no doubt that you would got better
resuits by buying wbat films yen want.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

It might cost more.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: It would cost a great
deal less. 1 fear that if the proposed commission is established it will keep the Film
Commissioner
busy
producing
at great
expense a lot of stuif the country does not
need. I appreciate the necessity of coordinating the departmnents. But wby add
three outside men to a commission which is
to do purely intordepartmontal work? Unless
they have been engaged in film production
they will have no particular qualification for
the work. We shaîl have to pay for that
inexperience.
I think before
proceeding
further the Government should seriously
consider the needless expense which will be
incurred in setting up the proposed commission. From the little experience 1 have
had in film production I am sure that the
riglit honourable leader on this side lias net
exaggc-rated the situation in the loast.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable mcmibcrs,
I hav e a few facta te present which, 1 think,
will demonstrate that some of the points of
view expresscd by the rigbt honourable leader
opposite (Riglit Hon. Mr. Mcighen) are, to
say the least, a woe bit exaggerated. 1 am
prepared to accept many of bis views on the
unsoundness of Government interference witlî
private enterprise.
What rallies me te the support of this
Bill is its educational feature. I do net think
my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
exaggerated at alI whcen hie emphasized the
value, from tlîe standpoint of education at
home and abroad, of the film production
now being carried on in varions~ Government

If in the past more publicity had been
given the Dominion through the distribution
of educational films, a most prominent and
well-educated lady of the United States, for
instance, would net have referrecl to the riglit
honourable leader opposite when hoe was in
the city of Windsor, at a timie she hiersoîf
happencd to be visiting Detroit, as "the
Mayor of Canada." As a Canadian I resenteif

the lady*s feelings precludes my mentioning

there been a wider distribution of educational
films throughout the Dominion,
certain
visiters from British Columbia would net
have been surprised a few months age, when
t-hey visited the province of Quebec, te find
that the province by the St. Lawrence was
"everrun with foreigners who could net even
speak the language of the country." These
incidents may sound incredible, but they
really bappened.
The very fact that this Bill was introduced
in the other House by the head of the Department of Trade and Commerce, a Minister
whom the right benourable gentleman opposite
described a moment ago as a most practical
man, implies that oneO of the purposes of
co-ordinating film production and distributien abroad is te promote the export trade
of Canada.
I infer from. my right honourable friend's
remarks on passant, that hoe is against any
policy of intensive immigration at the present
time,, and I am glad te register bis views in
that respect.
May I remind the bouse that, sbould we
look for a precodient regarding departmoental
film production, wo readily find anc in one
of our groatest enterprises, wbich bias been
actively using such means te promoto and
stimulate celonization: I mean the Canadian
'National Railways. Our Goveroimont transportation systom bas a well-organized department for that purpose. And I fail te remember one single occasion wben that initiative was ccnsured by my right bonourable
friend or anyhody else.
Supplementing wbat I have already said
about how unfamiliar witb tlîis country some
of our outside friends, even in the neighbourîng republie, appear te be, I may add that
many American tourists when tbey enter
Canada at the port of Windsor, in late afternoon, ask the immigration officer wbether
they can go te Callander and see the Quints
and be back in Windsor in timo for supper.
As xve know, prejudice and suspicion are
founded on ignorance, and in my opinion the
work of the proposed National Film Board
will be of great educational value in making known te Americans and others the touriat
attractions and industrial advantages of the
Dominion, and will at the saine time contribtîte te premoto a spirit of greator unity
ameng our own people by increasing their
knowledge of Canada, stimulating their love
for bier institutions and strengthening their
confidence in hier great possibilities.

Bill te Committee of the Wbole bouse. I

daubt very much whether that is advisshle.
1 feel quite confident that very, few members, including myseif, understand how far
Government departments are engaged in the
film business. I have only a faint recollectien of wbat happened some years ago, but I
recali some of the discussions that then taok
place, and the resuits. Sir George Foster was
very mucli interested in the film business of
the Department of Trade and Commerce of
those days. 1 cannot recaîl what happened
in the way of consolidation, but I arn certain
something did take place alang that line.
This Bill indicates thare is a film branch in
several departments of the Goverament
service, and those branches are in operatian
at the present time.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would not cal]
them branches. They have been using films
procured from outeside.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; but the departments will caîl them branches, and there wHI
be certain officials set aside to attend to their
business. I doubt very much whether we
can deal with this Bill properly unless we
have the officiais of those departments before
us, so we may ascertain just what is goîng
on, what it costs, and what they propose ta
do. Suppose we throw this Bill inta Committee of the Whole to-morrow. What do we
know about the subject-matter?
Nothing.
Not a member of this Huse knows anything
about what is taking place at the present
time, nor what it costs. I think the first duty
of honourable members is to find out what
is heing done, what this proposed ca-ordination involves, and what the expenditure is
ta be. The interpretation clause defines
"Director." It means the Director of the
Government Motion Picture Bureau. That
bureau exists now, it is in the Department of
Trade and Commerce, and, if I amn not mistaken, it has for some time been carryîng on
film work for other departments.
I repeat, I doubt very much the advisability
af aur dealing with this propased legislatian
until we -know a great deai more about it,
and that information eau only be obtained
from members af the civil service wbo are at
present carrying on this work in the variaus
departments.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable members, I have listened with interest ta what has
been said by the rîght honourable gentleman
on the ather side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
and the hanourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae). I am not surprised at
the objections ai the right honourable gentleman, for it seems that recentiy hie has regarded
any bill coming from. the other House as
71498-7j

ridiculaus, futile, and lacking menit. But I amn
surprised ta hear the honourable, member from
Vancouver objeet ta the Bull. I thought he
was a gentleman ai progressive views. The
right honourable leader on the other side paid,
unconsciously, I think, a great compliment
ta the Minister of Trade and Commerce,
who, as we ail know, is a hard-headed business
mnan and sizes things up bei are ïmaking a
decisian. Evidently the Minister thinks a
Bill of this kind wilI benefit aur country as a
whoie.
The right honoura.ble gentleman haa shawn
his strong antipathy ta films, and ta some
extent I share that antipathy. But we have ta
reflect that we are living in times different
from thase of some twenty years ago, when hie
was loaking after the affairs af this country.
The warld is moving forward and we are now
in a new enviranmient. I have been in many
towns in the United States and in Europe,
and of course I amn tharoughly familiar with
my own country, and I rnay say that those
wha, go to moving picture houses like to seee
films depicting what is accurring in other
cauntries. I enjoy some af thean, even though
there are many I do flot care for at ail. Now
and then I receive considerable instruction
through them.
I think the Bill can be aznended sa as ta
keep the cost down ta a minimum. Do
honourable senators realize that they themselves, and memibers ai the other bouse, have
voted a considerable sum for a tourist bureau.
It is a great asset ta the country, and even
though its benefits may not be visible, it is
getting resuits. This propased arganizatian
will bring resuits too, if it is handled properly,
as I believe it will be, under the direction
ai the Minister ai Trade and Commerce.
I think the Bill should be amended, perhaps,
ta eut dawn the cost. I cannat see why we
should have ta go outside ai aur own gaveramental officiais.
The right honaurable the leader opposite
(Right bon. Mr. Meighen) asks why the
Government do nat go into the automobile
business. That is not a fair analogy at ail.
There is no danger of the Government gaing
inta that business. This film bureau is a
pu'blicity arganizatian, not an industnial enterprise. The right honourabie gentleman talks
abaut immigrants. We are nat wanting ta
encourage immigrants, but there are many
people of different nationalities in this Canada
of ours who have not yet become Canadaconsciaus, and I take it that one of the objects
of this Bill is ta bring about this national
cansciausness through showing something of
the attractions and potentialities af the
different provinces and the interchange ai
business between them. I know that we af

Canada, and these pictures should belp to
bring about return visits. We cannot measure
flic value of this work in dollars and cents.
Tbe cost is goiog to be relafive]y small, and
flic Film Board will not be in competition
with commercial film concerns.
A remark w-as made about tenders. I sec
notbing in the Bill to preclude tenders. If tbe

educational work, there is notbîng to prevent
tenders, flîcugli I do not fhink fliat is tbe

MARCH 21, 1939
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I must admit that I have not knowledge
enough of this Bill to criticize it, even if I
desired to do so; neither have I sufficient
knowledge of the film activities of the Government to speak with any degree of intelligence at the present time on the Bill. I rise
simply to endorse what has been said by the
honourable senator from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) and the honourable senator from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). I think it
would be enlightening to all of us to have
this Bill referred to a committee where we
could get some evidence with respect to the
activities of the various branches of Government in this matter, and the cost pertaining
thereto. Certainly I for one should have
much more knowledge of the Bill and its use
if I had that information. Therefore I want
to endorse what has been said by the two
senators who have preceded me.
Hon. JOHN HAIG: Has any honourable
member of this House ever been in a theatre
where they showed a picture, such as is to be
produced by our department, of any other
country in the world? The only film of this
kind that is shown is News of the World, which
runs for about five minutes. It is composed
of news pictures that the younger people like
to see-sporting events such as the skating in
New York, Toronto or Switzerland, the curling
bonspiel in Toronto, the baseball game in
Chicago, or something of that nature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And other
problems of different parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; they do not show
those. In fact, the Minister of Mines and
Natural Resources prepared a picture 'on
Riding Mountain National Park last year, and
I think I am one of the few members of this
House who went to the private showing. Even
though it was in this building, I could see
but one or two senators present on that
occasion.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: You could not see them,
because the lights were turned off.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I saw the picture.
Hon.

Mr. DUFF:

But not the senators.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I saw them before the
picture started.
What I want to know is, how many
theatres there are in Canada where similar
pictures of any other country have been
shown at any time. I should also like to
know in how many other countries pictures
of Canada have been shown, and whether
there have been any requests for repeat
showings.

101

In the city of Ottawa there are the Elgin
Theatre, the Centre Theatre, the Capitol
Theatre and several others. In the last week
I have been at all three mentioned.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Last week in one of
the theatres there was a most excellent film
depicting the activities of the State Department at Washington.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, it was not one of the
theatres I speak of.
I have been in the business. I ran a
theatre in Winnipeg for about fifteen years;
so I know something about the matter. It
was a second-class theatre, and as padding,
to fill in our programme, we-took such pictures
as the one of Riding Mountain National
Park, or of some park in the Maritime Provinces. But the first-class picture theatres in
Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and other large
cities will not take them. I should like to
know how many of such pictures have been
taken by theatres in the United States, Britain,
France, Germany or any other large country
in the world. That information might be of
some use to us if, as the leader of the opposition has suggested, about the only purpose
that could be served would be to advertise
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: In answer to the
challengeSome Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I would ask the
honourable gentleman if he ever saw a picture
of the opening of the Ivy Lea Bridge, with
President Roosevelt and the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King shaking hands.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In the News of the World
I saw about a minute of film which showed
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. King meeting and
shaking hands, but that was all
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
help Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I had thought we would examine this
Bill in Committee of the Whole, but I am
perfectly satisfied to have it sent to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce in
order that the officials of the department, and
probably the Minister himself, may explain
the advantages of the Bill and what it is hoped
to accomplish. If we pass the second reading,
I am ready to do that.
I will answer my honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before my
honourable friend goes on, let me say that I
am not at all sure there are not others who
would like to speak on this measure, and T

SENATE

102

suggest that the motion of the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
be agreed to. The debate can then go on
to-morrow afternoon, and afterwards we can
decide whether we will go into Committee of
the Whole or send the Bill to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When I rose I
looked around to see if anyone was rising in
his place.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Some honourable gentlemen are thinking seriously.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to the debate being continued to-morrow,
but if there are some honourable members
who are ready to express their views now they
may do se. Then we shall adjourn until
to-morrow.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move the adjournment of the debate till the next sitting of the
House.
May I be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
allowed to answer a question which was asked
by the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)? I am net
closing the debate, 'but simply giving information. As of January 1, 1939, the bureau had
6,295 copies of its films in circulation theatrieally and non-theatrically throughout the
world. In addition it has provided quite a
number of duplicate negatives from which
prints can be made in the territories to which
they are shipped. Thus, the actual number of
prints of Canadian Government films in
circulation is probably in excess of 6,500.
The following table gives the territories and
the number of bureau films in active circulation in each as of January 1, 1939:

In addition, it is estimated that at least

for short periods to the Canadian National
and Canadian Pacifie railways, travel associations and bureaux, to public and private
bodies for exhibition purposes and for lectures
in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United
States and other countries, and placed at the
disposal of foreign, educational and commercial film organizations for inclusion in
films dealing with Canada.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Murdock, the debate
was adjourned.
CONFERENCE WITH BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, yesterday the Prime Minister made
an announcement to the country which was,
or was expected to be, a definition of the
Government's position in respect of the very
perilous crisis which now faces the world. In
that announcement it was said that the Government were ready to confer on the subject
with the Government of Great Britain or of
any other peace-loving country. That, I suppose, is a statement; it is one in the grammatical sense, at least. I should like to ask
the leader of the Government this: Is one
correct in drawing from that statement the
inference, which seems to me inescapable, that
up to the present time there has been no conferring on this subject with the British Government? And if such is the case, has the
Government's present willingness to confer
been communicated to the British Government, and, if so, when?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my right
honourable friend might have given notice
of his question. I simply read the report of
the House of Commons proceedings in the
newspapers, and I do not like te be governed
by such reports. Having no knowledge of
what may have taken place between our
Department of External Affairs and Great
Britain, I cannot at this moment answer my
right honourable friend. But I may say
this, that whatever statement was made by
the Prime Minister yesterday, concerning his
desire to confer with Great Britain or other
countries, was surely cabled te London directly
from the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When? Does
the honourable gentleman mean that communication would take place just through the
casual reading by the British Government of
reports of our House of Commons?

MARCH 21, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I do not
say that, but I should take it that whatever
was expressed by the Prime Minister of
Canada has, through the regular channels,
reached London.

LORD'S DAY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING REJECTED

Hon. CHARLES BOURGEOIS moved the
second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend the
Lord's Day Act.
He said: Honourable members, the present
Bill is exactly identical with one which we
had before us last year. I do not intend to
open up anew the debate with regard to more
severe measures to insure better observance
of the Lord's Day, nor to repeat remarks
which I made last session.
May I be allowed, however, to express my
surprise that last year this measure was
abandoned in the other House without resort
having been had to all the means afforded
in such circumstances for obtaining a final
decision from both Chambers. After the
other House had refused to accept the amendments which the Senate made to the Bill, I
moved that a joint committee be appointed
in order that, if possible, a common understanding might be reached between the two
Chambers. My suggestion was not approved
in the Commons. It seemed to me at that
time, and I am still of the same opinion, that
a common understanding could be reached on
this Bill. In fact, the Bill is not so drastic
as it appears at first. Its object is not to substitute new penalties for those already provided in the Act. Subsection 1 of section 14,
in which penalties by way of fines are provided, would stilI remain in effect if this Bill
were passed, but the trial judge would have
discretionary power to inflict more severe

103

penalties against directors or officers who,
without good reason, make their employees
work on Sunday.
It was pointed out last year that certain
industries require constant operation and so
employees have to work in them on Sundays.
That is not a serious objection to the Bill, for
there is nothing in it to restrict section 11 of
the Act, which makes provision for all these
eventualities.
That section enumerates a
large number of exceptions, that is, classes
of work which may be performed on the
Lord's Day. It says:
Notwithstanding anything herein contained,
any person may on the Lord's Day do any work
of necessity or mercy, and for greater certainty,
but not so as to restrict the ordinary meaning

of the expression "work of necessity or mercy,

it is hereby declared that it shall be deemed
to include the following classes of work.

Then follow the twenty-four exceptions.
However, if in spite of those exceptions,
which appear to cover everything that need
be covered, certain industries have good reason to fear this proposed legislation, let us
send the Bill to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce and add other exceptions to
those already provided by section 11.
Directors who act in good faith have nothing
to fear from this amendment. As I said last
year, they would have a very simple but
effective means of insuring compliance with
the measure, if it became law, by passing
resolutions or by-laws prohibiting their superintendents from having work done on Sunday
except in circumstances such as are provided
for by section 11. We all know that no action
or prosecution for a violation of this Act can
be commenced without the leave of the
Attorney-General for the province in which
the offence is alleged to have been committed,
and I think directors may feel sure that no
Attorney-General would ever give his consent
to sue anyone under this amendment unless
he was certain that a real infringement had
been committed.
Last year I took a clear stand in this matter.
I express myself now in favour of the present
Bill, which would provide new and more severe
penalties with a view to insuring a stricter
observance of the Lord's Day, for experience
bas shown that the penalties provided by the
present Act are insufficient and without real
effect. I move second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, no one can help admiring the
ability as well as the tenacity with which the
honourable senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr.
Bourgeois) has sponsored this measure in two
sessions. Nor can anyone, regardless of his
views on the measure, complain that the
honourable senator is obdurate or unreasonable about it. He has taken a very reasonable

SENATE
position as respects amendinents which this
House thought were clearly in the interest of
the business community, and which would
permit attainment of the full object which
the honourable member has in mind. But for
some reason the other House persists in sending the Bill to us in its present form, providing
that men shall be punished for offences which
it is presumed they would commit, not for
themselves, but for the shareholders of a
company. That is, the Bill would lift punishment from the company, which gets the
benefit, and lay it on the director, who
does not.
I am not going to argue the merits of the
Bill again. I have already exhausted the
patience of the House by arguing the same
points in a previous session. I only say now
that I cannot bring myself to accept the Bill.
I cannot see that the other House is staking
its existence or reputation on the passing of
this measure. At all events, though I regret
opposing the honourable senator from Shawinigan, if the Bill coines to a vote I will vote
against it. I am not seeking that anyone
follow me in this matter because I happen to
be leader on this side.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: I do not
want anyone to vote except as he feels the
merits or demerits of the case demand.
Honourable
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE:
members, I hesitate to speak a second time
to-night, for I do not want to impose upon
the House. But as seconder of the motion of
my Ponourable friend from Shawinigan (Hon.
Mr. Bourgeois), for second reading, I want
to emphasize three points in favour of the
Bill.
The first of these points is that the imposition of punishment, under this amendment,
would be left te the discretion of the magistrate. He would not be obliged to impose
an increased penalty. Of course, if a man
wero prosecuted and found guilty three times,
let us say, he would expect a more serious
punishnient on the third occasion than on the
first. I am net a lawyer, but I think that is
in accordance with general practice.
Then, no prosecution can be undertaken
without the leave of the Attorney-General
of the province where the offence is alleged
to have occurred. Se I do net think there
need be any fear that directors would be
prosecuted from improper motives.
The third point I desire to emphasize is
that net very long ago the right honourable
leader opposite emphasized the principles of
democracy which are the very basis of our
system of government. I do believe that once
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

a measure has twice consecutively received
unanimous endorsement at the hands of the
elected representatives of the people it should
be regarded as a forcible argument in favour
of its adoption by this Chamber. Upon this
principle I base my argument in support of
the very sincere plea by my honourable friend
from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois).
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, this Bill came before us last
session, and I take the word of my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
that it also came before us in the preceding
session. If I am not mistaken, we referred
the Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee, whïere it was amended in some important respects. The amendments were not
concurred in by the House of Commons.
The Senate declined to withdraw its amendments. When the Bill was returned to the
other House, the ordinary procedure would
have been to ask for a conference between
the two Houses, but this course was not followed and the Bill went by the board. I
doubt whether, after what occurred last session. it is proper for this Chamber-which
desires Io work in harmony with tho other
House, although differing from it on certain
bills-to reject the motion for second reading.
I would favour the Bill being referred again
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. and sufficient time being given to
the parties interested to appear before the
committen, which would then act according
to its discretion.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, inasmuch as this Bill bas been before
the Banking and Commerce Committee on
two different occasions. and as last session a
similar bill was amended to increase the fines
and delete the gaol penalty, I do not sce that
any good purpose can now bo served by again
referring the Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Like my right honourable leader (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), I have the greatest respect for the honourable member from
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois), and I
admire his tenacity, but I would remind him
that the Lord's Day Act applies not only to
the district of Three Rivers, but to the
whole of Canada. In previous sessions I have
asked on more than one occasion if the
honourable gentleman would tell us how many
complaints he had received from the whole
of Canada, but I have never been able to get
that information from him.
As I pointed out to the honourable senator
last session, emergency repairs are never
brought before the board of directors at all,

105

MARCH 21, 1939
The order is given either by the general
superintendent of the plant or by the general
manager. So why directors should be mentioned in this Bill is beyond my understanding.
Furthermore, no manufacturing concern desires to perform work on Sunday unless it is
an absolute necessity. I never could understand the persistence of the honourable gentleman in trying to press the Bill through
this House. After all, it is not a Government measure; it is sponsored by a private
member.
I am not overwhelmingly impressed by the
fact that the other House, without a single
voice of protest, has sent this Bill to us on
three different occasions. The honourable
senator, like myself, was at one time a member of the other House, and I do not need to
go into certain details of what is done there.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I bave not been a
member of the other House, and should like
to know what is done there.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not think
it would ba either necessary or proper for
me to give any explanation on that point.
Suffice it to say that not long ago I spoke to
a member of the other Chamber about this
Bill, but he did not know anything about it
at all, notwithstanding the fact that this is
the third occasion on which it has been before
the Commons. We do know that private
bills go through there without very much
attention being paid to them.
I have always been against the Bill, and I
am still against it, but at the same time I
want the honourable senator from Shawinigan
to know that my personal regard for him is
just as high as it has always been, and that
my opposition is not against him, but against
the principle of the Bill.
Hon. D. O. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
senators, while I am in favour of the
observance of Sunday, as I am sure every
other member is, I really do not like the
way the amendment is drafted. I certainly
should not like to vote against the motion
for second reading if it is proposed to refer
the Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

But why?

it back to us. What good purpose could be
served by prolonging the matter? Why not
make a decision on it now?
Hon. Mr. BOURGEOIS: Will my honourable friends not consent to the Bill being
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, where I should be pleased to submit details concerning the different industries
As I
in Three Rivers and other places?
remarked last session on the motion for third
reading of the Bill, I was relying on the
opinion . of the Minister of Justice, the
Bishop of my own district and the President
of the Quebec Sunday Observance League. I
think I was in good company. If my honourable friend wants to come to/Three Rivers
on a Sunday, he will see employees going to
work with their lunch boxes, and trucks loaded
with goods. This, I think, might cause him
to change his mind.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Bourgeois was
negatived: contents, 11; non-contents, 21.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the Bill

conceivable that there might be other interests
affected.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Explain.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The object of this
Bill is to give corporate form to an organization which has existed for a great number
of years as a sort of co-ordinating body for
the Canadian Clubs throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that another
kind of board?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
There
are a great many other things in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. There are
provisions for governing the powers and
functions of this body.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is this a
Bill to control the Canadian Clubs throughout the country?

MARCH 22, 1939
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, no. It is really
to give corporate form to an organization
which has existed for many years, and which
is a central body, subscribed to by* all the
Canadian Clubs.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But
what is the real object of it?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I cannot give any
further explanation that I have just given.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
think anybody else can, either.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I assume that this
organization feels it should have some sort
of corporate form for the purpose of suing
and being sued, holding property, and so
forth.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But the
Canadian Clubs are not corporations.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No, the Canadian
Clubs are not. 'Well, frankly, I do not know
anything more about the matter than what
I said a minute ago, that it is the desire to
make into a corporate body this organization, which has existed for a long time. I
intend to move, if the Bill is given second
reading, that it be referred to the appropriate
committee, which I suppose would be the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills. Any questions may be asked there, and
answers can be given by the proponents of
the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, we all know there are
Canadian Clubs in many of the larger, as well
as some of the smaller, centres in Canada, and
I think we all feel they have done a very
substantial, worth-while and wholesome work
in our country. Perhaps honourable senators
around me know more about them than I
do, although I was president of one. I
presume all the clubs have uniform charters
and similar constitutions, in which are set
out their objects. If that is so, I doubt very
much whether those objects are parallel with
the objects of this association, as enumerated
in clause 2 of the Bill:
(a) To foster and encourage a national public
opinion and spirit, to stimulate intelligent
citizenship, to awaken interest in public affaire,
and to cultivate an attachment to the institutions and soil of Canada;
(b) To foster friendly and equitable relationships between the two great races of the
Dominion in the full recognition that each race
is equally entitled to express and preserve its
identity and culture.
I do not know whether that is in any
Canadian Club charter. Perhaps it is.
(c) To establish a faithI pause until honourable members get the
full significance of that word.
71498--81

107

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What is the. word?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Faith.
(c) To establish a faith in the position of
the Canadian nation in association under the
Crown with the other nations of the British
Commonwealth.
To establish a faith in our position in the
CommonwealthI I do not know whether my
faith is established in that or not, or just how
I should feel if it were. Perhaps others,
better skilled in the English language, can
tell me what that means.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You are
asking too much.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It should read, "to keep
the faith."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Faith is defined in many ways. The honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) could give
them all to us at once. But just what is meant
by a faith in our position in the British
Commonwealth?
I go on now to the next object:
(d) To support the participation of the
Dominion of Canada in the League of Nations,
and in the work of establishing a stable and
peaceful world society.
I am thoroughly agreeable to the second part
of that subsection. I do not disagree with the
first part of it. But I wonder what the fact
is. Are all our Canadian Clubs committed
to perpetuation of the League of Nations? I
have never heard so. I do not think they
have ever taken any position on that at all,
and I do not believe it is in their constitution. Why should an association come to
the Parliament of Canada and say, "We represent all the Canadian Clubs and we want
incorporation, one of the objects of which is
to support. participation of the Dominion in
the League of Nations"? I question here
the right of the association to state that
any such thing is the uniform objective of all
the Canadian Clubs.
The other purposes specified in the Bill
perhaps do not need comment. They are:
(e) To assist new Canadians to become part
of the life of the Dominion and to encourage
them to become acquainted with Canadian
institutions, and to contribute to the common
weal their particular racial culture;
(f) To encourage the study of the arts,
literature and history of Canada, its economie
organization and its problems generally, and
its tradition of British justice and liberty;
(g) And otherwise to assist in making Caaada a strong nation united from sea to sea;
(h) And to these ends, to encourage the
organization of Canadian Clubs, to facilitate
the interchange of club privileges and the
transfer of membership among Canadian Clubs
to exehange information and publications and
generally to promote the influence and effectiveness of the Canadian Clubs.

108

SENATE

The two objects to which I call attention
are those specified jn subsections (e) and (d).
'l'le first of these, the one to establish a
faith in our position in the British Commonwealth, seerns to nie te be an indistinct
object and pure suîrplusage. As to the other,
I dispute the right of any organizatien to
cerne here and declare that participation of
the Dominion of Canada in the League of
Nations is one of thc objectives of the Canadien Clubs.

.NATIONAL FILM BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 35, an Act to create a National
Film Board.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, yesterday while listening to the debate on this Bill I was reminded of two
somewhat similar proposals which came before
us for consideration. About fifteen years

ago the statistical activities in various departments of the Government were consolidated
under the Bureau of Statisties. I was present
on an occasion when three or four capable
civil servants made a very earnest, but unsuccessful, protest to the Minister of the
department against the proposal to place them
under the jurisdiction of the proposed bureau.
A similar situation arose a few years ago
in relation to the translation work carried on
in several Government departments. I think
some honourable members will recall how
wires were pulled at that time to prevent
this or that individual from being transferred
to the proposed central organization, which
eventually was authorized by Parliament.
To-day, it seems to me, we are confronted
with an almost similar situation. This morning I took steps to ascertain the extent to
which our film activities are scattered amongst
the departments. If we were told there is
a Government Motion Picture Bureau. we
should conclude that it is the logical centre
for and carries on all film work undertaken
by the Government, but I find that is not
the case. For instance, film activities are
conducted by the Parks Branch, the Department of Agriculture and the Grain Board.
I understand that the Grain Board has distributed a considerable number of films in
the Old Country for the purpose of showing
conditions in our wheat-growing provinces.
It seems to me-and I should like my
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) to listen to this thoughtit seems to me that those of us who are
really in favour of unification ought to find
right here a concrete illustration of the
necessity of placingHon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -the film activities
of various branches of the Government service
under the control of the Motion Picture
Bureau. Some high-class civil servants in the
National Parks Bureau, the Department of
Agriculture and the Grain Board, and presumably some in other departments, would like

109

to retain their identity and continue piling up
expense, but surely we have reached the stage
where there should be unification of activities.
Motion pictures are a comparatively new
creation. It is only a few years since they
were introduced. I think we should be very
short-sighted if we did not co-ordinate our
several film branches under the jurisdiction
of one department.
Yesterday it was su-ggested that this Bill be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. I think the suggestion should be
adopted, so that those of us who are not
members of the committee may also be able
to ascertain just how far departments of the
Government are engaged in film production
and distribution. And I should like to know
something more about the cost of our film
activities, for to my mind we -are now
confronted with a situation similar to that
which faced us in the past when our statistical
and translation staffs were centralized.
What I am now about to deal with -may not
have a direct bearing on the subject-matter
before us, but I deem it advisable to bring
it to the attention of honourable senators.
I hold in my hand an illustrated booklet of
about thirty pages, advertising Canada, and
intended primarily for circulation at the two
great world's fairs at New York and San
Francisco. On the front cover, under the
caption "Canada Calls You," there is a
splendid picture of one of our Mounties in
his trim, colourful, uniform. I would recommend that this booklet be placed in the hands
of all the women school teachers in the United
States, for when they look at that handsome
Mountie they will, I imagine, come to Canada
in droves. Forming a composite background
to the central figure appear the snow-capped
mountains of the Rockies, a beautiful sylvan
lake with anglers on its shore, and opposite
them, apparently alongside the St. Lawrence,
one of the darling old mothers of Quebec busy
at her old-fashioned loom. The booklet is
profusely illustrated and contains a set of
very fine coloured maps of the Dominion and
the several provinces, showing our national
parks and other fascinating features. This
should give our American cousins some idea
of the many vacation attractions of the
Dominion, and induce many to cross the
international boundary and spend their holidays among us. As I understand, this is also
the primary purpose of establishing a Motion
Picture Bureau-to make known to the world
the manifold advantages of Canada. So I
hope we may have an opportunity in committee of securing the information necessary
to enable us to deal intelligently with this Bill.

110

SENATE

Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, last night I was almost on my feet
when another member got ahead of me, and
as it was then suggested that the Bill be
referred to the Banking and Commerce Conmittee, 'I felt disposed not to speak. It seems
to me that much of the discussion arises from
lack of information, and that the logical place
to obtain information is in the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
This morning I took occasion to read the
speech which the right honourable leader
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) delivered
yesterday. Certain of his statements, some
of a general, others of a particular nature,
I should like to challenge, doing so not in a
militant but in a friendly spirit, and as I fear
I shall not be here when the Bill is reported
from committee, I hope honourable members
will pardon me for discussing it somewhat
fully at this hour.
When, some weeks ago, the right honourable
leader opposite discussed the question of the
adjournment of this House and the scarcity
of legislation available, he commented on
the fact that the Senate had been fair to
the Government in its legislation.
From
my brief experience in this House I would
agree with what he said in that connection.
If lie will permit me to do so, I should like to
add that I think the right honourable leader
opposite bas a sound conception of the
Senate's constitutional position and of the
proper application of the constitutional sanctions which limit, not the power but the
riglt of the Senate to interfere, particularly
with such Bills as have the approval of the
Commons as the elected representatives of
the people. While in his voting lie has been
fair with respect to the Bills that come before
this House, I am not so sure that in his
speeches he has been equally fair to the Governrment.
I have before me the speech which the right
honourable
gentleman
made
last night.
Because of the appointment of one paid official
to this co-ordinating body, which obviously
is created primarily to curtail expenditures,
not to enlarge them, he stated that the increase
of public officials under this Government has
gone on to an appalling degree, and that this
Bill constitutes, in aggravated form, one of the
results of pursuing that course. Again, in
referring to other actions of the Government
which he suggested were of a similar nature,
he said they were all evidences of the weakness and imbecility of the Government. One
might derive consolation from the fact that
at least fifty per cent of this extravagance
occurred when my right honourable friend was
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

in office. I suppose that would suggest a fifty
per cent imbecility on the part of bis Government.
In addition, I recall other observationsone, particularly, because it affected the city
in which I live. In discussing the post office
strike of last year the right honourable gentleman referred to the Government with contempt as a supine Government.
I shall not take time to collect other observations of this kind, but I would suggest to
my right honourable friend, and to this House,
that these are serious statements, strong statements, particularly when coming from him.
There are two reasons for this. One is that
the right honourable gentleman once held the
position of Prime Minister of Canada and that
to-day he occupies the very high and responsible position of leader of the opposition
in this House. The second is that no man in
this House has more often pointed out the
position of this Senate as a deliberative body.
I think those allegations are aggravated, if I
may borrow a word fron his vocabulary, by bis
admission, first, that he knows very little of this
particular kind of business and bas seen only
four moving pictures in his life, and, second,
that he had almost a positive hatred for that
form of activity. In discussing this question last
night the right honourable gentleman said he
would try to banish his prejudice against the
films, and in this I think he succeeded; but
there was no promise that he would make an
equal effort to banish his prejudice against the
Government. To me it would be a great
source of entertainment te sec a moving
picture of the right honourable leader opposite
standing up and giving the Government credit
for something they had donc in regard to
public affairs.
The other day, in discussing the Penitentiary
Bill, I had occasion to point out the danger
of opposition in detail to any measure tending to improve conditions by those who are
opposed to the measure in its entirety. It
seems to me that the sane warning could be
uttered again to-day with respect to the
criticism of the Bill before us. Honourable
members would kill this Bill-I am thioking
particularly of the right honourable leader
opposite, and of my honourable friend and
colleague
from
Vancouver
(Hon.
Mr.
McRae)-the suggestion being that because
the activity and enterprise of the Government
in the film field do not meet with their
approval the Bill should be killed. It seems
to me that a policy of that kind might be
illustrated by reference to a ship coming
into a harbour where it is necessary to have
a pilot. If my right honourable friend were
to have the decision as to whether the ship

MARCH 22, 1939
should have a pilot or not, he would say:
"No. I have never seen but four ships in
my life, but I do not like that ship, the
business it is doing or the place it has come
from; so I will see that it does not get a
pilot." If it were once granted that that
ship had a cargo and was coming into port,
the least that could be done would be to
provide all the safeguards possible for bringing it in.
I should like to say a word, honourable
members, about the policies of the Government which are attacked because of increases
in the personnel of commissions, and in relation to services and other forms of activity. I
think that at times we all feel a little disturbed as we see taxation increasing in this
country. But we all recognize that governments to-day are acting, as never before in
history, in the way of recognizing public
demands for services which at one time were
not regarded as coming within the sphere of
government. So this is a question, not of the
Government engaging new officials, but of
recognizing and dealing with fundamental
problems.
I have before me the platform and resolutions of the National Conservative Convention held in July last. I had some difficulty
in getting it. I find here a most positive
declaration:
The National Conservative Party hereby
declares its opposition to any plan of unification or amalgamation of the great railways of
Canada.
Following that is a statement in favour of
co-operation. That means, as I understand it,
that both parties are more or less at one;
that the public of Canada, as represented by
the great parties, are without any qualification committed to government ownership of
railways. Well, honourable gentlemen, that
is a most striking departure from what at
one time was our conception of governmental
responsibility in the furnishing of services.
In that connection we all know what a tremendous burden has been placed upon the
country, but who in the publie life of this
country can challenge the policy of providing
additional public services when such a one
as this, the most comprehensive of all, is
solidly backed up by every great party in
Canada?
Now, I may be allowed to use a bridge
term. I do not mean the kind of bridge you
cross. There is a little bit of cross-ruffing
taking place against the Government. Leaders
in another place who are of the same party
as my right honourable friend attack the
Government in a way exactly opposite to the
way it is attacked by my right honourable

friend. We have heard the expression that
it is a "do-nothing Government." The charge
is made that there is not enough activity on
the part of the Government in furnishing
services the people demand, and we have heard
that when the next election comes along the
great Conservative party, headed by those
who will be in the forefront of the fight, will
adopt that form of attack against the Government. At the same time my right honourable friend, as one of the outstanding leaders,
makes an attack from exactly the opposite
direction.
Since the issue has been raised as it has
been in this discussion, I think we are entitled
to ask ourselves whether the Government
should be in the film business at all. That
seems to be the real issue. The answer of my
honourable colleague from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. MeRae) is "No," but I do not think
he fully appreciates the length of time the
Government of Canada have been in the film
business. During the discussion we learned
that when Sir George Foster was Minister of
Trade and Commerce this film activity was
started by the'then Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It was started before
that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well, it was given a
greater impetus by the activities of that right
honourable gentleman.
The honourable member from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) said that he had some
experience of moving pictures when the War
was on. I suppose that would be twenty years
ago. He seems to thinl that because of the
failure of that enterprise, which was but an
incident in the services he was performing,
the Government should go out of the making
of films. I have had a little experience myself.
When I was Attorney-General of British
Columbia we started a film business in that
province in a small way. We did one bright
thing: we passed an Act compelling every
theatre in the province to run our pictures for
five minutes every night of the week. We
took some very excellent pictures, and they
aroused great interest. We did a good work.
The business was discontinued because the
field was thought to be too narrow, not
because the business was a failure.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
says the business is a very technical one.
I have taken the trouble to read the speech
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce in
another place. He tells us that in the Department of Trade and Commerce to-day there
is a most efficient organization for the manufacture of pictures. I may be permitted to

112

SENATE

refer to what the honourable Minister said.
I read from page 1881 of the Debates of the
House of Commons:
To-day there was in my office a gentleman
who, I know bas had a wide experience je
all lines of ilm production. In fact, he was
at one time engaged in Hollywood itself. He
assured me to-day that the equipment we have
in our own film bureau in the Department of
Trade and Commerce is the equal of anything
of its size in Hollywood. It is absolutely up
to date. I repeat that for the information of
the committee. I do not know that I can add
anything more at the moment.

net understand why my right honourable
friend does not forget his antipathy to picturcs and sec some of the good ones. I know
of no branch which can be of greater inspiration towards accomplishing something for
this country.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) told us that
be had had fifteen years' experience of the
picture business-

A little later on he informs a committee in
another place that there is only this one
departmental film organization, and that when
other departments wish to have pictures taken
they either utilize this organization or engage
some private organization and pay it for its
services.
Now, the head of this bureau is a gentleman
who stands very high. I have forgotten his
name for the moment.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, no. He said it
was a seceond-class theatre, but I think it takes
even more ability to operate a second-class
theatre than one that is first-class. I did not
hear any objection from that honourable
gentleman. I regret that my experience in
making recommendations for positions with
the Government bas not been satisfactory,
but, if the honourable gentleman would permit, I should be glad to make a recommendation on his behalf.
The right honourable leader on the other
side reviewed the duties of the board, as set
out in the various clauses of section 9. As to
the distribution of Government films in other
countries, be suggested that would be all
right if we were seeking immigrants.
He
left his criticism at that, as though immigration were the only activity in which Canada, a great trading nation, is at present
inierested. In his discussion be entirely overlooked the facts that the measure was brought
in by the Minister of Trade and Commerce.
that the Dominion of Canada bas to-day an
immense trade with the countries of the
world . and that the moving picture is recognized bv all who are interested in its distribution, whether frou a Goverment or a
private standpoint, as a powerful instrument
to stimulate international trade.
Although other senators called it to his
attention, my right honourable friend made
no mention of the tourist traffie, which we
know is one of the greatest financial assets
that the Dominion of Canada has. In particular
we are all aware of our tremendous annual
influx of tourists from the United States, and
everybody knows that this business is just in
its infanc . To any honourable member who
secs moving pictures and appreciates them,
who goes to the theatres often enough to
perceive the tremendous hold they have on
the citizens of Canada, I would respectfully
say: "I challenge you te declare that they
are not one of the greatest possible means of
developing our tourist trade, particularly with
the United States."
Paragraph (a) of section 9 is designed to
promote the showing of national films in

An Hon. SENATOR: Badgley.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have here a reference
by the Leader of the Opposition in another
place to Mr. Badgley. He says:
The moving picture bureau under Mr.
Badgley, of the Department of Trade and
Commerce, is a branch for which I have a
good deal of respect. While I was never
Minister of Trade and Commerce I was acting
Minister of that department occasionally when
the then Minister, the honourable member for
Kootenay East (Mr. Stevens), was away.
Thus J became acquainted with the work of
Mr. Badgley and his group, and I have a
great deal of respect for him.
My honourable friend fron Vancouver bas
said that this is a technical business. The
tchbnical side, as I take it. is under the
supervision of the director, and on the technical side this Government, both in the matter
of equipment and personnel, have already
made a success.
Mr. Euler bas said, and there seems to be
no question about it, that Mr. Badgley's time
is entirely taken up in the production end of
the business, but that there arc two other
great problems that have to bc considered.
One is the type of pictures, and the
other. perhaps tbe most important of all, is
the distribution of the pictures. It is primarily in regard to tbese activities that this Bill
is to be enacted, and it seemis to ie that
what is required under these circumstances
is not a technical judgment, but a broad
common-sense judgment based on experience
of business affairs; and that is what will be
sougbt in the formation of this board. It
has been suggested that these men would net
give their services for nothing. I cannot
understand why that should be se. I canHon. Mr. FARRIS.

to quote. He is exceeding the rule to a considerable degree. My understanding, based
upon an experience of many years in the
Senate, is that a member very seldom quotes
extensively what has been said in another
place. I am afraid that if that door is opened
we shall at some time in the near future get
into very serious trouble.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise to a point of order,
too. I did not want to interrupt the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) when he was speaking, but I
will say now that the first part of his speech

purely a political speech.

honourable members that it would not do
any harm if the citizens of Toronto and other
parts of Ontario who have not had the
opportunities my right honourable friend
opposite has had for travelling all over
Canada were to see something of the life and
opportunities, and of the scenic beauty and
charm, that we have down in the Maritime
ProvincesSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -and in the province
of Quebec. It would do no harm for my
right honourable friend, even, to refresh his
memory of what golden wheat looks like
when it is waving in the wind at sunset. I
am sure that people from all other parts of
the country would be greatly benefited if
they were able to enjoy some of the magnificence and grandeur that British Columbia has
to show.
Finally, honourable members, those of us
who go to the moving pictures are conscious
of the fact that the business is dominated by
United States interests, and that on the screen
we are shown the President of the United
States, various state governors and other
officials, not to mention a great many phases
of Anerican commercial life, far oftener than
we are shown anything about our own country.
None of us here would want to banish these
American films from our theatres, but I think
everyone who goes to see the pictures and has
observed the extent to which our young
people get from them their ideas of public life
and private affairs will agree that through
this popular inedium the Government of
Canada have a great opportunity, and an
obligation as well, to bring home to our
citizens a consciousness of our own nation,
its greatness and its future.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable members, is on the second reading of Bill 35, an Act to create a National

BUSINESS

OF

THE

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I find that there is nothing on the
Order Paper for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

That is unusual!

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And there is
nothing to be expected from the other House
for to-morrow.
I had intended to move
that when the Senate adjourns this evening
it stand adjourned until Monday evening
next, but I have received a considerable
number of suggestions that we adjourn until
Tuesday evening. I am ready to move in
accordance with these suggestions, but it
may mean that next week we shall have to
sit from Tuesday evening until Friday in
order to dispose of the work that will then
be before us and to lighten the agenda for

MARCH 22, 1939
the following week. I move, somewhat reluctantly, that when the Senate adjourns this
evening, it stand adjourned until Tuesday
evening next at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, as
one who comes from a Western province, I
object to adjournments of this kind. They
are unfair to senators whose homes and
places of business are a long distance off, in
the Maritimes or the West.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The proposed adjournment will not give us an opportunity of
returning home. This is Wednesday, and if
the honourable leader's motion carries we shall
have to stay around Ottawa, with nothing to
do, until next Tuesday. Then probably there
will be enough work to keep us busy right
at the time of the usual Easter adjournment.
I strenuously object to this. What we ought
to do is to sit five days a week, finish up our
work and then adjourn for one or two weeks,
or until there is enough business from the
House of Commons to keep us busy.
I sympathize sincerely with the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). He wants to go back home to
attend to some business, but if he does so
he will be fined for non-attendance here.
Yet senators from Ontario and Quebec will
be able to go home to-night and will then
have three days left out of this week for
attending to their business, and at least another full day next week, while we who come
from long distances have to kick our heels
around Ottawa. This is neither fair nor just
to us. If it is impracticable- to sit all next
week, finish our business, and then adjourn
for two weeks, we should be exempted from
the rule requiring our presence at the sittings
and be permitted to stay away as long as
we like.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I should agree with the honourable
senator's suggestion that we stay and finish
our work, if there were any work for us to de
If there were anything for us to-morrow,
or Friday or Monday, we ought to be here to
attend to it. But there is not; so it is a
question of either ad-journing now until next
week or else adjourning for two weeks.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Adjourn for two weeks.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I know
there will be work awaiting us before that
time, and I feel it would be undutiful of us
not to be here. As I live in Ontario, I know
that these short adjournments are of more
advantage to me than they are to honourable
members whose homes are at a distance.

11à

But I am prepared to stay here the whole
week at any time. I do not want to take
advantage of the procedure that we have been
following. The objection to our adjourning
for two weeks just now is that there would be
work awaiting our attention before we got
back. Of course, we shall have the Railway
Committee sitting next week. It would have
been in session to-day but that illness has
prevented an important witness in Calgary
from being here. We cannot conclude our
evidence until he arrives. We could postpone
the meeting of the committee to a later date,
but I can understand the disinclination of the
leader of the Government to take the responsibility of having this House not in session
next week when business from the Commons
reaches us, or there may be a desire to initiate
certain measures here.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think that when adjournments are being considered some members
from the Maritime Provinces and from
Western Canada should be consulted. We
might point out to the leader of the Government the advisability of adjourning occasionally for two weeks and then sitting for a
couple of weeks of five days each. This
would be much fairer to those of us who come
from the Maritimes or Western Canada. I
recognize that next week we must come back
because it will be necessary to pass a Supply
Bill to carry on the business of the country,
and I am willing to be here; but in future,
I repeat, members froin distant provinces
should be consulted, for certainly it is very
tiresome to stay here by the week doing
nothing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
while my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig)
was away we took very good care of his
interests.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I appreciate that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have never
failed to think of the situation which he bas
described, and at the request of the champion
of his idea, the honourable gentleman from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), I agreed to give
three weeks to my honourable friend while he
was in Winnipeg. I will try to see if we
cannot accommodate our friends from the
extreme East and the West, and at the same
time do our duty by the country.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I understood the leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to say that next week
it would be necessary to sit until Friday.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No; that we might
have to.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I heard my honourable
friend say that we should probably have to
sit until Friday of next week. I would suggest
that we adjourn until Monday night, and,
since there is to be an Easter recess, we might
adjourn next Thursday, so that those of us
who live at a distance may have a little
advantage.
I have not complained before, but I share
the feelink of my honourable friend from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). I am a busy man,
and I can find much to do while I am at
home. I take my duties just as seriously as
any other member, but it seems to me that
when an opportunity like this occurs we
might adopt the suggestion I have made.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, perhaps I am a little guilty in proposing that we revert to the old practice of
sitting Tuesday night until the following
Thursday.
I deeply sympathize with the
disadvantage that our colleagues from the
extreme East and the West are subject to,
as compared with the favoured position of
their colleagues who live close to Ottawa, and
if by sitting on Monday night there is any
prospect of giving them a longer recess, I
shall certainly be prepared to agree to the
proposal. I understood the honourable leader
of the House to say that on account of pressure
of business we might be called upon to sit
next Friday. If in his judgment that is to
be the case, I am perfectly agreeable to
attending here Monday night. We sit three
days a week.
Why?
As the honourable
leader opposite knows, three days suffice for
this Chamber to do what constitutes a whole
week's work in the House of Commons. As
he has said, our Order Paper is clear. Within
three days next week, I expect, we shall be
in the same position. In three days we can
get into step, so to speak, with the work coming from the other House. The honourable
leader opposite, no doubt, bears in mind that
those members who live within easy reach of
Ottawa arrange their business so as to utilize
their time to the best advantage. However,
we are perfectly willing to do whatever may
be necessary to suit the convenience of our
colleagues fron the East and the West.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, we who live in the far East and the far
West have always had the sympathy of our
colleagues who live within easy reach of
Ottawa with respect to these adjournments;
but I would ask them to give us something
more than sympathy. We shall, I presume,
be adjourning next week over Easter, and it
would accommodate us very much if the
recess could be made as long as possible; and
now is the time to arrange for it, in order to
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

give those of us from the far East and the
far West an opportunity to go home and
stay there a little while.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is right.

time to make the necessary arrangements.

PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 36, an Act to amend
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is to amend the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act of 1935. I desire to congratulate the then Minister of Agriculture,
who presented that legislation to Parliament.
I found it so simple and so full of merit that
it was a pleasure to read what had been
effected under it in the three Western provinces.
Honourable members who have the Act
before them will see that it contains only
nine clauses, and yet under its authority
activities have been promoted throughout
the Western provinces which, I think. the
people there have appreciated. The administration of the Act was entrusted to the
Department of Agriculture. Since 1935 the
Ministers of Agriculture have been representative of the West and familiar with Western
conditions, and officials of that department
have supervised the work carried on under
the Act.
The amendments do not vary the principle of the Act, nor do they to any extent
increase the powers of the Minister. So that
honourable senators may understand the
nature of the amendments, I will go through
the original measure and indicate how it is
proposed to be amended.
Clauses 1 and 2 of the Act are not affected.
Clause 3 gives the constitution of the
advisory committee in these words:
The Governor in Council may establish a
committee to be known as the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Advisory Committee, hereinafter
called "the committee," the members of which
shall hold office during pleasure.
In the following subsection the membership
of the committee is set out. That clause was
changed by the amending Act of 1937 to
read:
The Governor in Couneil may establish one
or more advisory committees to be known as
the Prairie Farm Rehabilities Committees,
the members of which shall hold office during
pleasure.
One of the members of each advisory committee shall be appointed chairman thereof by
the Minister.

SENATE
Under the authority of the clause as amended a committee was formed to deal with
water development, and another, composed
of officials of the departrnent, to serve in an
advisory capacity. The principal committee
has remained virtually the same as constituted
under the original Act. J have before me the
names of its members as well as the members
of the Water Development Committee and
the advisory committee of departmental
officials. If any honourable senator desires
to have these particulars I shall place them
on Hansard when we come to the committee
stage. The sole difference in the make-up
of the general committee is that representatives of the farming population now replace
the nominees of the grain growers' organizatien.
Clause 4 was also amended by the Act of
1937. The clause as amended reads:
The advisory committees shall consider and
advise the Minister as to the best methods
to be adopted to secure the rehabilitation of
the drought and soil drifting areas in the
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and to develop and promote within
these areas systems of farm practice, tree
culture, water supplyThe following words were added by the
amendment:
-land utilization and land settlement that will
afford greater economic security, and to make
such representations thereon to the Minister
as the advisory committees may deem expedient.
The Act of 1937 made no changes in clauses
5 and 6.
Clause 7 of the original Act is in fact the
empowering clause. It reads:
The Governor in Council may make such
regulations as may be necessary or expedient
for the effectual execution and working of this
Act and the attainment of the intention and
objects thereof.
Under this clause the Minister was vested
with all the necessary authority to administer
the Act through regulations approved by the
Governor in Council. Under it agreements
were made with the various provinces, cities
and other municipalities for the acquisition of
lands for irrigation purposes, for the flooding
of certain areas, for the establishment of pastures, and so on. I mention this in order that
honourable members may know that all
authority flowed frorn clause 7; and, as I have
said, this clause is not amended. But the
officials of the department charged with the
checking and controlling of expenditure have
suggested that authority should come direct
from Parliament instead of through regulations. Hence clauses 10, 11 and 12 of this Bill.
Clause 8 of the original Act provided:
For the purposes of this Act the sum of
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars shall
be appropriated and paid out of the ConHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

solidated Revenue Fund of Canada during the
fiscal year 1935-36 and for each fiscal year
for a further period of four years a surn not
exceeding one million dollars per annum as may
be necessary to continue and extend the work
undertaken under this Act.
It will be noticed that clause 8 provided for
the payment of a total sum during those five
years of $4,750,000. The powers under the Act
apparently would be exhausted in 1940. The
Act of 1937 amended that clause to read:
For the purposes of this Act the Governor
in Council may from time to time authorize
the expenditure in each of the fiscal years
1937-38 to 1939-40, inclusive, of sums not
exceeding the amount appropriated by Parliament in each year for such purposes.
But in that amendment the life of the Act was
not extended, for the words remained, "in
each of the fiscal years 1937-38 to 1939-40,
inclusive." By the amendment now proposed
these words would be deleted and the clause
made to read:
For the purposes of this Act the Governor
in Council may from time to time authorize
the expenditure of sums not exceeding the
amount appropriated by Parliament in each
year for such purposes.
This would allow for the operation of the Act
so long as Parliament decided to continue the
work and vote the necessary moneys.
As I have said, authority flowed from clause
7 and regulations made thereunder, but it is
now felt that it should come from Parliament
itself. Three new clauses are therefore added
to the Bill.
Clause 10 says that the Minister may enter
into agreements subject to section 4 of the
Act, which provides:
The advisory committees appointed shall consider and advise the Minister as to the best
methods to be adopted to secure the rehabilitation of the drought and soil drifting areas in
the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and to develop and promote within
these areas systems of farm practice, tree
culture, water supply, land utilization and land
settlement that will afford greater economie
security, and to make such representations
thereon to the Minister as the advisory conmittees may deem expedient.
Under the Act the Minister, operating under
clause 7, had to accept the advice of the
advisory committee or committees, which was
approved by Order in Council. Under the
proposed clause 10 the same procedure is to
be followed. The new section 10 reads:
The Minister may, subject to section 4 of
this Act and with the approval of the Governor
in Couneil, enter into agreements with any of
the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan or
Alberta or with any city, town or other municipality within any of the said provinces, or
with any person, frm or corporation, with
respect to the development, promotion, construe-

MAROR 28, 1939
tion, operation and maintenance of any project
or acheme undertaken under and by virtue of
this Act or which may bie deemed necessary
or desirable for the conservation of water.
Clause 11:
The Minister may, for the purposes of the
Act, and with the approval of the Governor in
Council, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire,
or seil, lease or otherwise dispose of, any lands
or premises which may be required for or
included in any project or scheme, upon such
terms or conditions as hie may deem desirable.
1 may say that ail such powers as would
be -conferred by those two clauses have been
exercised fully, eince the inception of the Act,
by the Minister, who was entrusted with its
operation. They have 'been exeroiscd under
section 7, with, of course, the authorization
and direction of the committees. that were
appointed.
Clause 12 says:
The Minister may, for the purposes of this
Act, purchase or rent whatever machinery or
equipment may be required in connection with
the development, construction or operation of
any project or scheme: provided that the
purchase of any single unit of machinery or
equipment of a value greater than fie thousand
dollars shahl require the approval of the
Governor in Council.
A similar proviso binds ail departments in the
expenditure of sums in excess of $5,000. An
Order in Council muet be passed.
The section continues:
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other
Act or law, the Minieter may sell any single
unit of euch machinery or equipment upon such
termis as hie may deem advisable and the proceeds thereof shail be paid to the Receiver
General: provided that the sale of any such
unit shaîl if its initial cost exceeded fie
hundred dollars, require the approval of the
Governor la Council.
I may say with reference to section il that
lands purchaeed by the departmnent are sometimes required for the building of abutmenta
or are lands which will have to be flooded.
I amn informed that they are generaily bought
at approximately $10 an acre and that after
the work has been done the remnants of those
lande are disposed of at the sanie price.
The right, of the Minister to dispose of
machinery' or equipme.nt acquired ini connection with some of these works applies to
such machinery or equipment as could not
be used by the Goverament without having
to be carried some distance at considerable
cost, but could be disposed of on the spot to
farmners interested in the work. I may say the
Government have no macbinery for dugouts.
With these explanations I moire the second
reading of the Bill. If the Senate is disposed
to send it to Committee of the Whole this
evening, I should be glad to furnish ail the
further information that may be asked for by
honourable members of the Senate.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIýGHEN: Honourable members, there will be no one in the
House who will not sympathize with the puarpose of this measure. It is the saine purpose,
of course, as that which. accounted for the
introduction of -the legisiation of 1935 and the
amendment of 1937. For more than aine yeare
now the West has suffcred fromn drought, saine
sections continuously and others intermittently. As I understand it, the poiicy of the
original Act and the amending legislation was
to combat drouglit by the method authorized
under those measures. One is therefore reluctant to find fault with the Government's
demande in respect of a purpose se laudable
and so necessary. But I think the Minister
has painted this measure in terme which make
it appear much more innocent than it is.
The Act of 1935 provided that the Minister of Agriculture of the time should have
certain investigatory and executive powers
in respect of seeking to provide, by irrigation,
for the rehabilitation of drought-stricken
areas in the West. An emergency had arisen,
not with great suddennese, it is true, but
through a succession of years, culminating in
a very dry year in 1935, and some method of
attack upon the problem and the tremeadous
distress which it entailed was esseatial.
The 1935 Act gave the Minister certain
powers, it is true, to construct works. The
amouat named in the measure was $750,000.

For the firet

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For the first
year. The terme of that Act made the legislatien effective year by year until the end of
the fiscal year in the spring of 1940, but it
was provided that anything to be done should
be done after investigation by aad upon
the adirice of a board, the members of which
were aamed ex officio in the legisiation itself.
Section 3 reads as follows:

That was under

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, it was
not. That Act was an emergency measure,
and a temporary one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For five years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But that Act
established a board, which the Governor in
Council could not dismiss. There was the
restriction. This Bill not only sweeps away
that restriction, but it makes the Act
permanent. There is no limitation as to time
or amount. Whatever is voted each year
appears in the estimates, over which we in
this House have virtually no control whatever. Indeed, members of the other House
have very little control over them. We know
how these figures come down in the last days
of the session-a million here and a million
there. In fact, I think-I have not checked
this, and if it is wrong I will withdraw itthat this whole vote of $3,500,000 for last year
was brought down in a supplementary estimate in the last two or three days of the
session. Speaking from memory, I feel sure
that I saw it for the first time the last week
of the session. And that is the way the vote
will be brought in again.
Not only is the limitation removed as to
amount and time, but the safeguard of a fixed
committee is dispensed with. Thus, wholly
unlimited, lord of all he surveys to the extent

121

of that amount voted in the estimates, the
Minister of Agriculture is put in charge of the
treasury of Canada. These are facts to which
I call the attention of the House. A time
may come when the Parliament of Canada and
members of this Government will regret having
vested these extraordinary powers in any
Minister. If that time comes, let them
remember that I gave warning to-night.
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
senators, there are one or two things I
want to say with regard to this Bill. My right
honourable friend who has just taken his
seat said that under the Act of 1935 the committee was fixed and could not be removed.
Well, this is what that Act said:
The Governor in Council may establish a
committee to be known as the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Advisory Committee, hereinafter
called "the Committee," the members of which
shall hold office during pleasure.
They were appointed by the Governor
General in Council and could be removed at
the pleasure of the Governor General in
Council.
My
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
honourable friend is right so far as he has read,
but if he reads further he will sec that nothing
can be donc unless there is a committee to
advise, composed as set out there. If you fire
the men who are on the committee, the new
members must be appointed just as the old
ones were.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Composed of representatives from those bodies.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: But, as a matter of
fact, what was that committee to do? The
Act says that it
shall consider and advise the Minister as to
the best methods to be adopted to secure the
rehabilitation of the drought and soil drifting
areas in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta . . .
This was a purely advisory committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The money was
voted to the Minister and the Act provided
for his expenditure of it. Another clause in
this original Bill read:
The Minister may appoint such temporary
technical, professional and other officers and
employees as he may deem necessary and
expedient for carrying out the provisions of
this Act and the salaries and expenses of such
officers shall be fixed by the Governor in
Council.
The Governor in Couneil may make such
regulations as may be necessary or expedient
for the effectual execution and working of
this Act and the attainment of the intention
and objects thereof.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Could the
honourable member answer me a question?
The Minister says that sometimes land was
bought and, after having been dealt with
for a while, was sold again at the same price.
I do not understand why land is bought
and sold at all. Why is it not leased?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I do not know
of any land that was sold, or that was even
bought for money. Land has been taken over
by the Government from the different
provinces and municipalities, upon no payment whatever. This land had come to the
municipalities for taxes. But if any acreage

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Some land might.
be purchased for the making of lakes, in
connection with small irrigation plants.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it
would not be sold.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No, not if it was
bought for that purpose.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then, why
does the Minister take power to sell?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I am bound to
say that I cannot answer that. It may be
that the Bill was drafted by a lawyer and he
provided for everything.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is quite possible
that, in undertaking a conservation scheme,
those in charge might have to buy a whole
quarter-section or a half-section, but of that
area perhaps only three-fifths could be used
for the purpose under development, and the
rest, not being required for any other purpose, would be sold.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I can quite
appreciate a situation such as the honourable
member mentions. I am quite sure it is
not the intention of the Minister or the
department to go into the business of buying
or selling land. But if land is bought for a
special purpose, some of it may not be
required, may be just outside a fence that is
erected, and that portion which is not required
may be sold.
This scheme was started by one Government and has been carried on by another.
It has cost some money, but I have a good
deal of faith in public men. I have been
mixed up in politics for about half a century,
and I have found that as a rule about 99
per cent of the members of governments try
to do their very best for the. country. Frequently they are a little more anxious to do

123

a good piece of business for the country or
for their Government than they would be to
do it on their own account.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I wonder if my
honourable friend has always said that about
all members of all Governments.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. I would not
quite take in the whole lot. I remember
a deputation telling the late Arthur Sifton
if they were given support to build a railway 200 miles north of the Peace river, they
could develop enough wealth to pay off the
whole national debt of Canada. He inquired,
"Do you think it would be fair to ask them
to pay it all?" It might not be safe to be too
inclusive. But, seriously, public men who
occupy responsible positions generally endeavour to do their very best for the country.
Mr. Weir was a citizen of the West and
interested in its farming. I am quite sure
that had he gone on in charge of this development-for I regard it as a development-he
would have striven to the utmost to see that
it was well administered. I am sure that the
present Minister of Agriculture will do the
same.
After all, the thing we want to do is to
rescue from farming the lands in Western
Canada that are unfit for the growing of
crops, and to get the people out there back
into the raising of more live stock. Nothing
will encourage that so much as the providing of these pastures.
The amendments respecting the committee
that were discussed by my right honourable
friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
are not in this Bill at all. They were passed
last year by this honourable House and in
another place. So they are really not before
us for consideration now. The only matter
for consideration is really the addition of
clauses 10, 11 and 12 to enable the Minister
to do what, after all, the Act entitles him to
do. However, he and a number of the
officials thought it would be much better to
have the authority incorporated in the Act.
The chairman of this committee is still Dr.
Archibald, who, as superintendent of the
Experimental Farms, has given more than
an ordinary amount of attention to the
drought and soil-drifting areas in Western
Canada. He. has studied conditions out there
perhaps more than any other man who has
been in charge of work of that kind. Undoubtedly he is highly qualified to do this
job. Three committees are functioning to-day.
One is an advisory committee composed of
Dr. Barton, Deputy Minister, Dr. Archibald,
who is chairman of the other committee, and
Mr. R. A. Olmsted, the legal adviser in the
department.

SENATE

I think the amendments are reasonable, as
any expenditure has to be voted by Parliament. This development in Western Canada
is very important. We hear rumours of other
bills to come before this House during the
present session with respect to the wheat
question. I believe that its final solution will
be found in just such measures as this to
enable farmers to adopt a better system of
farming, a systern which is likely to be of
more lasting value than anything that bas
been attempted in the past.

get those people who remain moved out on to
lands immediately adjacent. We then put a
fence round the lands and make them available to the people who are living roundabout.
They pay a fee for putting their live stock
into the pasture, and these fees are supposed
to cover all costs of maintenance, including
the maintaining of the fences and the paying
of the pasture manager. We assist as a Government in raising the standard of the live
stock within that pasture. The Government
inspector decides how many cattle the pasture
will carry. The grass is investigated by a
man having the technical skill necessary to
determine how many cattle or how many
cattle and horses can be carried. We then take
in the farmers in the first mile round the
pasture, then those in the second mile, and so
on until we get a sufficient number of farmers
having approximately two-thirds of the stock
the pasture will carry. The farmers are then
asked to form themselves into a community
pasture association and appoint a committee
to operate the pasture. We allow them to
divide up the acreage and determine how much
live stock in relation to the acreage shall be
put in. We set up certain regulations which
apply to the pasture. Honourable members
may want to know the reason for placing the
limit at two-thirds. In all probability after
these men have gained a little experience they
will want to add to their on-n herds or admit
other farmers to the pasture. We leave it to
them to determine what shall be dons within
certain limits, but we do not permit them to
put in more cattle than the lands will properly
carry.
That is only one feature of the work being
carried on. Millions of dollars have been
spent, but I feel that the Minister, Hon. Mr.
Weir, who initiated the legislation, knew what
was required and planned his work in a
satisfactory way. He took authority under
the advice of a board and with the consent of
his colleagues 'by Order in Council. I am quite
sure that if my right honourable friend bad
read the whole of the debates that took place
at various times in the other House he would
have felt there was an atmosphere of confidence throughout the West as to the manner
in which these moneys were being expended.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I read all the
debates, but when something was said twice
I did not read it a second time. That is all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had to deal
with the Bill here, and therefore I gave a few
extra hours to a careful study of those debates.
I need not weary the House with a statement
of all that is being donc under the Act. It is
sufficient to say that the Federal Government
are carrying on exceptionally successful work
in the three Prairie Provinces. I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
members, I should like to discuss this Bill
from a background of over fifty years' experience in the district where the expenditure is
to be made. When I hear of vast sums being
voted from time to time to carry out various

enterprises I wonder what is going to happen
to the financial credit of this Dominion.
I am surprised at some of the statements of
the honourable member from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall). He knows as well as I do that the
land he is talking of rehabilitating is useless
to anyone. No doubt he has read John W.
Dafoe's book in which the author recalls that
Mr. Sifton said the land south of the main line
of the Canadian Pacific Railway should never
have been taken from the rancher.
For the information of some honourable
members who do not understand that country,
I may say that it is impossible to bring the
land back again to pasture. The honourable
gentleman from Peel knows that as well as I
do. After you break the prairie and touch
the virgin soil you cannot bring it back into
pasture; you will have only a mass of weeds
for your pains. I see other honourable members nodding their heads. They know the
truth of what I am saying. A good many years
ago I leased from the Government 20,000 acres
south of Medicine Hat, where it is proposed to
make this expenditure. Let me say at once
tbat you might as well throw the money into
Lake Ontario as put it into that arid district.

up you cannot bring it back again.
I remember when Sir Lester Kay owned
100,000 acres of land from Swift Current west.
He tried to grow wheat there. He had water
carts to water the land, and he tried everything, but without success. He lost his money
and finally sold his 100,000 acres and 5,000
choice cattle to Mr. Andrews, who afterwards
turned the cattle loose on the range and used
the land for ranching purposes only. Talk
about bringing that land back to pasture by
watering it! One good week's sunshine would
dry up all the water in one of the ditches.
The thing is absurd.
While I am on my feet, I may say that the
acousties of this Chamber is so bad that over
here we have considerable diffliculty in hearing the discussion clearly.
The proposed rehabilitation work is the
greatest farce I ever heard of, and the honourable senator from Peel knows that just as
well as I; and so does my honourable friend
from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley).
The
honourable gentleman from Peel was all
through that country for several years. It is
easy enough to get evidence that you should
not, at a time like this, make such heavy
expenditure on land of that description.
My honourable friend from Peel the other
day told us something about the cattle industry, and I thought at the time he was
entirely wrong. I kept silent until I could
be certain. Later I found he was right. I

SENATE
agree with him in what he said then in regard
to the shipping of beef. But, I repeat, the
land proposed to' be rehabilitated is suitable
only for the rancher, and if you spend money
as suggested you are simply wasting it.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You are only going
to fence it.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: You know how much
acreage you need under a fence in Western
Canada. Surely the people should be advised
by those who know something about the
matter. It takes twenty acres to feed a
bullock if it is under a fence. I do not know
about the technicalities of the Bill. I am
not bothering about those. My life bas been
forged upon the broad anvil of Western Canada, and when it comes to a project of this
kind I cannot help saying it is entirely wrong
on the part of the Government to put money
into it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say in
answer to my honourable friend that conmunity pastures are specifically for the purpose of taking sub-marginal or non-productive
land out of cultivation.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Léger in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
Mr. Stephenson, of the Department of Agriculture, to come to the floor.
On section 1-appropriations:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the Minister answer
my question now? Was any of the money
appropriated under this Act spent on damming the Saskatchewan river above Saskatoon? If so, under what authority was it
spent?
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that money was spent under a vote for water
storage in 1938-39.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Was that
provisions of this Bill?

under

the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, it would be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is all I want to
know. I do not think the damming of the
Saskatchewan river above Saskatoon has anything to do with the conservation of water
for the farmers of Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
Hon. Mr. MULLINS.

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think so.
understand that $350,000 bas been spent.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

I

$243,000.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand the cost is
going to run over the estimate.
Take for instance the Souris river, which
rises in the United States, runs north, and then
through the eastern part of Saskatchewan, and
joins the Saskatchewan river at about the
middle of Manitoba. That river bas dams in
four or five places, and last year there was not
enough rain to fill thern all, and two or three
of those dams had no water in thern last
August.
Now as to the lands that are brought under
fencing. I happened to own a section of that
kind in the province of Saskatchewan. The
Government of Saskatchewan wrote and asked
me to give them the land. Well, the land
was not worth anything, though I had been
fool enough to pay taxes on it, and I was
glad enough to give it away.
I think there must be at least twelve thousand and there may be more acres of land
where there are dugouts to catch the snowwater in the spring. If those fill up there
will be snow-water for a good part of the
year. I can support what lias been done in
the Western Provinces in the way of dugouts. That scheme is all right. What I am
objecting to is the expenditure of $243,000
in damming the Saskatchewan river, which
cannot by any stretch of the imagination be
regarded as a work of water conservation for
the farmer. It may be fine for the city of
Saskatoon, and I think it is.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

And Moose Jaw.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The water has not yet
been used in Moose Jaw. But I am objecting
to an expenditure of $243,000 on a scheme
that has nothing to do with the flooding of
land in the dried-out area. That is why I
say the Bill, in giving power to the Minister,
is going away beyond the intention of the
Act. The intention was that under the Act
works such as the damming of the Souris
river should be undertaken if, as a resuit,
the farmers would benefit by reason of having
water storage for their cattle and horses. It
is a good scheme, and practicable, to dam
those large tracts of lands and fence them if,
as the honourable senator from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall) has said, the land will hold
water. In the Red River Valley there is a
clay bottom, and it will hold water; but in
certain areas in Saskatchewan there is a sand
bottom, and the water will just seep away.
I say you should not give the Minister
power to build a dam on the Saskatchewan

MARCH 28, 1939
river wherever he likes. That is wrong. I do
not say the dam I have referred to should
not have been built, but it should not have
been built under this legislation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What purpose is that dam serving now? Is it supplying
water for a city?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Saskatoon gets its water
out of the Saskatchewan river above the city.
Two years ago, and the year before, the people
were fearful that the river would run dry,
and this dam was put in as a reservoir to
hold the water.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Is that not conserving
water?
Right Hon. Mr.
farmers.

MEIGHEN:

Not for

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not in the sense of helping agriculture or cattle raising. It has nothing to do with the original intention of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think the honourable
member should look farther ahead. In addition to conserving water for the growing of
crops you must conserve water so that the
people can continue to live. I have known
of conditions in the West under which people
had to haul water a distance of from ten to
fifteen miles for their cattle and their horses.
If by building a dam across the Saskatchewan
river it is possible to provide the people in
the community with water, it would be a
conservation of water and would, I think,
come under this law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said this
money was spent under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, but the appropriation read:
"Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act and Water
Storage." The water storage in this instance
was not related to the rehabilitation of farmers, although the work was carried out under
the supervision of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation engineers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What the honourable
member from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
says does not alter the principle of the Bill.
I am willing that the Government should
vote money for storing up water in rivers for
the purpose of supplying cities. Winnipeg
would have liked to have that done, but that
city had to spend its own money.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As a matter of fact,
many of these small dugouts that are
scattered over the prairies are for the purpose
of ensuring the people a supply of water to
drink, not for putting the land into condition
to grow crops.

127

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I know it is true.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The dugouts to whiich my
honourable friend refers have been built
during the last thirty years, to my personal
knowledge, and have been provided by the
farmers themselves. You can get a very fine
dugout, twenty feet deep by fifty feet wide
and one hundred feet long, for one hundred
dollars. The work is done with steam shovels.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Away back in the
early nineties the old Territorial Government
were providing money for these dugouts in
order that the people might have water.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
misses my point. The honourable member
from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) praised the
Government for doing this thing for the purpose of rehabilitating agriculture, but a great
deal of the money has been spent in other
ways, and that is why the expenditure has increased so much. I do not think that worka
like the damming of the Saskatchewan for the
benefit of the city of Saskatoon are part of the
scheme under the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was a special
vote for the purpose.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-agreement with the provinces,
cities, etc.: The CHAIRMAN: Shall I read the section?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
an amendment is to be proposed. Except for
the clause that is to be amended, the Act is
simple and as plain as day, and there is no
need to read anything. Has the Minister an
amendment to move?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to,
The Bill was reported.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

MARCH 29, 1939
I am told it is the custom in such cases to
refund the fees, less the cost of printing and
translation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was it withdrawn because of impending legislation?
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It was left pending
b-ecause, I understand, a committee was formed
to study similar legislation; and in the meantime the Bill died. It was not read a third
time.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I hope my honourable friend who sponsors this motion will not
regard anything I say about this as personal
in any way. I shall be quite satisfied with
whatever the Senate determines to do. I
wish, however, to bring to the attention of
the Senate a situation that is somewhat similar,
the circumstances of which most honourable
gentlemen have not had an opportunity to
consider. Here we have a request from the
Industrial Loan and Finance Corporation for
a refund of fees paid two years ago. The
other day, in another room in this building,
a committee had before it. a request from a
poor fellow who, as I recall, was a janitor,
and who a couple of years ago secured a
divorce. At that time he paid all the fees
required of him. Since then he appears to
have learned that very often fees are refunded
to those who make application for divorce, if
they are in hard luck. So he came along and
asked for a refund of the fees he had paid
two years ago.. Now, many of us here are
interested in conserving money for the people
of Canada, and some of us wax very eloquent
about it, and, with reference to what I have
said, I want to ask if we are going to give
an illustration of the Biblical adage that
"Unto every one that hath shall be given, but
from him that hath not, even that which he
hath shall be taken away." The poor janitor
could not get a refund, though there is, I
think, no doubt that if he had asked for it
at the time of the divorce it would have been
granted. In view of these circumstances, can
we do what is proposed by this motion?
Yesterday we granted a refund of fees in
response to an applicatiori made on behalf
of a church, and we have to-day had notice
of a similar motion with respect to another
church. I think that is consistent with the
income tax law, under which we are allowed a
deduction of money given to charitable purposes. But we have heard what the finance
corporations do in the line of business, and
I wonder whether, under the circumstances,
we should make a refund to this concern,
which put the money into the pot in order to
get a Bill satisfactory to it, but was turned
down in another place.

129

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It was not turned
down.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, the Bill was
not dealt with in another place. I do not
know that this amounts to very much; but
can we afford to establish the principle of
refunding moneys that for two years have
been the property of the Federal Government, just because someone comes along and
asks for a refund? If so, the Divorce Committee, of which I am a member, ought to
give the poor janitor another shake at the
dice box and another chance to get his money
back.
Hon. Mr., DONNELLY: Honourable members, I do not think the comparison made is
quite appropriate. In the case which the
honourable senator speaks of, the man got his
divorce, and application was made for a
refund on the ground of compassion. In this
case the refund is asked, not from the Senate,
but from Parliament, and it relates to a Bill
which came properly before Parliament and
was neither accepted nor rejected, but died
on the way. The application is being made
on the ground that the Bill was not dealt with
by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
that he postpone his motion so that I may
look into the practice of the Senate and the
House of Commons in regard to such matters.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I move the adjournment of the debate.
The debate was adjourned.

COST OF THE SENATE
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
members, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I desire to refer briefiy to a matter of
considerable importance affeeting this honourable Chamber.

71498-9
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is a
very large and indluential organization, extending all over the Dominion of Canada. Its
official organ is called "Canadian Business."
On page 37 of the March number of this
publication there appears under the title
"Ottawa Legislates " the following item:
Two months have now gone by in dilatory
debate and Parliament has not yet passed a
single vital piece of legislation. In f act, the
Senate at $5,000,000 per annum has gone home
to roost for a second time because of the
dearth of legislation for it to consider.
I have had the actual figures of the cost of
maintaining the Senate looked up, and these
have been audited and certified to. Honourable senators will be pleased to know that the
total is only $577,342.62. There is a great
disparity between the real annual cost of the
Senate and the amount of $5,000,000 which
was erroneously stated in this article. I hope
that in the next issue of its organ the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce will see that
the figures are corrected and that an ample
apology is made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I add that
during the last twenty years there have been
many discussions as to the cost of the Senate
to the ratepayers of Canada, and we found
that the annual interest on the money which
the Senate had saved through its action with
respect to certain legislation was larger than
the amount spent by-the Treasury every year
on the Senate. Millions have been saved by
this Chamber. I may say that in 1912 or 1913
the Senate rejected a vote of $35,000,000 for
dreadnoughts which Mr. Winston Churchill
asserted were needed by the Admiralty and
which were already on the stocks in Great
Britain. I will net discuss the value of the
policy adopted by ,the Senate at that time.
I merely wish to point out that the interest on
$35,000,000 at 4 per cent would pay for the
cost of the Senate for quite a number of years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should be
the last to boast of that saving.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know. Tiat is
why I am not going into the merits of the
matter.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Had the
Senate no other reason for existing than its
conduct at that time, I should be in faveur
of its immediately raising the white flag,
surrendering, and saving the half-million of
annual cost. But my purpose in rising is
mostly to say that I do net think the journal
which was quoted intended its article to be in
any way an attack on the Senate.
Hon.

Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
quite proper that the figures stated there
should be corrected. The intention of the
article was to complain that we had not
worked when we should have worked. Probably the mention of $5,000,000 instead of half
a million was merely, as I say, an unintentional errer; or it may have been what the
very distinguished man who was quoted by
the leader of the Government once called a
terminological inexactitude.
PRICE

SPREADS.-REMEDIAL
MEASURES

CRITICISM

OF RETURN

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, on February 14 last I asked the Government the following questions:
1. Is it a fact that the Government have
taken steps to redress the abuses mentioned
in the report of the royal investigating commission appointed by a resolution of the House
of Commons on February 2, 1934, with power
to seek and examine the causes of the wide
spread between the price received by the
producer for his goods and the price paid by
the consumer for the said goods; also to study
the system of distribution of farm produce and
other natural products, and manufactured
products, etc., in Canada?
2. If se, what measures were taken in that
respect?
Yesterday the Government brought down
a return, answering the questions in a manner
which I consider net proper. To explain
the uncommon delay in replying, the Government from time to time pleaded illness.
A sorry convalescence caused to be brought
to the honourable leader of this House yesterday a voluminous answer, which, being overheavy for our thin Debates of the Senate,
was laid on the Table. After reading the
document I am convinced that the venerable
leader might have found it more appropriate
te answer as follows:
The present Government have done nothing. But the previous Goverrment adopted
measures which, although approved by Parliament and sanctioned by the Governor,
were declarcd ultra vires by the Judicial Coiimitte of the Privy Council.
I say this because the document produced
yesterday contained nothing but copies of
Acts adopted in 1934 and 1935, Orders in
Council passed by the Bennett Government,
and three very short letters from three deputy
ministers, stating to their respective ministers that they found nothing on the subject
in the legislation of the Government since
1935. Now I understand the sufferings of
one of the victims of sleeping sickness.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If honourable
members will read the honourable gentleman's inquiry they will find that it bears on
the whole economic policy of the Government. That whole policy, as effected through
the tariff and agreements with various
countries, has contributed to a certain extent
in working towards the goal urged in the
Price Spreads Commission's report. The subject is too large to be treated in a simple
question to the Government, and my honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)
knows that very well.
He speaks of sleeping sickness. Would
honourable members allow me to recall an
incident that may be interesting, and perhaps amusing? When Mr. Lloyd George was
justly overthrown by the Conservative party
in England, he was replaced by Mr. Bonar
Law. Mr. Bonar Law's first statement was
that Great Britain was somewhat tired of the
exciting agitations carried on by the previous
Government and wanted a bit of rest. A
daughter of another ex-prime minister, later
Earl Asquith, said, "We had St. Vitus's dance,
but now we have sleeping sickness."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)
has been, I think, quite unreasonable with
the Administration, and I sympathize with
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). One should never
expect a government to make a naked
acknowledgment of failure. When the honourable senator from Rigaud asks what they
have done to remedy a situation which they
themselves declared was existing, he should
not expect them to say anything. He should
allow them all the latitude of euphony which
they can possibly exercise. Such latitude
is all that the honourable leader of the Government has availed himself of.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The late Government brought down a policy which was
disallowed by the Privy Council.
The
present Government, in developing their
economic policy, have tried to do something
towards curing the evils mentioned in the
Price Spreads Commission's report.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL'S REPORTTRANSLATION AND DISTRIBUTION
On the Orders of the Day:

(Translation)
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: I wish to ask the
honouraible leader of the Senate whether the
French version of the report of Mr. William
O'Connor, legal adviser to the Senate, respecting the British North America Act, has been
printed, and, if se, when it is to be distributed.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I may tell
my honourable friend that the report to which
he refers bas been printed and that a copy is
at the disposal of the members of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I refer to the French
version.
The French
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ver-ion has not come to me. I may say,
however, that the translation will probably
take some time and that, if necessary, I shall
give orders for an increase of the translation
staff, or at least see that the Translation
Bureau assigns a sufficient number of its
staff to this considerable task. I do not know
how long the translation work will take, but
I will insi-t on its being completed with the
least possible delay.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Lot us be serious. I am
informed that net a line of the report bas been
translated and that no orders have been given
for the preparation and distribution of a
French version.
I take this opportunity of pointing out that
the French language is too frequently ignored
in connection with documents of the Senate.
For instance, the French edition of the Debates
of the Senate arrives most of the time five or
six days later than the English edition. This
should net be tolerated. In the Senate, as in
the House of Commons, the French language
enjoys constitutional rights, and I insist upon
Moreover, the public
their recognition.
interest demands that the O'Connor report be
published in the two official languages and
widely distributed, se that the leaders of the
two mother-races may be able to give it deep
and profitable study. Failure to do so would
expose us to expressions of opinion based on
incomplete analyses or inaccurate data.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend bas drawn attention to the fact that
the Senate Hansard is not distributed on time.
The matter had net been brought to my
knowledge. In addition, he says that Mr.
O'Connor's report, laid on the Table yesterday, bas not yet been translated. The Senate
received it only yesterday. I do not see the
necessity of passing a resolution on the subject.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

The translation of the report will be effected
in the natural course of things. Should there
be undue delay, it goes without saying that
we eould ask the Translation Bureau to assign
a certain number of translators to the work.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN (Text):
Honourable members, I was net able to understand everything that was said by the honourable gentleman from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Sauvé) and the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but I think I
have the purport of it. This report by our
Parliamentary Counsel is undoubtedly going
to receive very much attention throughout the
country. I have already received requests
for copies. Copies will no doubt be produced
in each language, because, if ever there was a
report of common interest to the two large
sections of our people, it is this one. I should
like the honourable leader to explain generally
what is the Government's plan as to the number of copies to be printed, and their distribution. I will not suggest any unnecessarily
large number, as I know the book will be an
expensive one, but there should be enough
copies to meet a large demand.
I have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
asked about the translation of Mr. O'Connor's
report. I have net yet had occasion to read
the document, but I intend to do so during the
recess; and I have no doubt I shall find it
very interesting, because it deals with questions which engross the minds of all who are
interested in constitutional affairs. I take
it for granted that when such a report is
brouglit to the House no special resolution
is needed for laying on the Table a copy in
each language. So now the question is reduced to this level: how long will it take to
make a translation? That cannot be done
overnight. If the Bureau for Translations
needs to assign a certain number of translators
to this work exclusively, this should be done,
in order that the French version may be distributed as well as the English.
RIGHT HON. GEORGE P. GRAHAM
BIRTHDAY FELICITATIONS

On the Orders of the day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is my agreeable duty to draw
attention to the fact that one of our senior
colleagues will to-morrow reach his eightieth
birthday. I refer to my right honourable
friend at my right (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
I have thought it proper te signalize that fact
by wishing him, in your name, many more
yoars, and expressing the hope that we
may have him constantly among us for

MARCH 30, 1939
a long time to corne.
It is *unnecessary
to say how much his qualifies have endeared
him. To everybody who knows him at ail he
is known as the popular George P. Graham.
I leave it to, your imagination to suggest what
qualities are needed to make one so popular.
Wa ail join in wishing him many happy returns of the day.
Hon. SENATORS:

Graham). Hie has heen with us a considerable time. I have been associated with hirnif that is the right phraseRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -for a very

quite the same again.
He has endeared

we shall ail know why it is that he has

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable mambers,
I arn sure no one will object if I risc to join
the leaders on both sides of the House in
tandaring congratulations and tribute to my
good friand Sanator Graham.
The right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Mcighen) said ha had been associatcd
with Senator Graharn for a long tima. So
have I. It is something like twanty-five years
since I firat knew him, and during the past
twelve years we hava been roorn-mates, and
very closaly associatcd. Honourable members
could spand many an hour diiscussing the
distinguished service ha has given to this
country, and wec ail kncaw of his loyal and
humanitarjan attitude towards his friands
and everyone who comas into contact with
him. I feel that if it could be said of anybody
that ha grcw old gracefully, that can ba said
of George P. Graham. My associations with
him have kapt me years younger than I otherwisa should have bean. In joining in the congratulations to Senator Grahamn I couple with
his name that of his wife, who has kcpt him
so well over a long pariod. Wc ail wish him
the very hast of haalth, and hope ha will continua to ha one of the members of this honourable body for a long tirne to corne.

it appears to me that I have not done- much
at this session, anyway, to disturb the peace
of anybody.
I want to thank the leaders and members
of the House. I do not know which side
they are on; I cannot see well enough to tell
that unless I get close, and that is not proper
in the Senate. I want to assure them that
although I am thought to be getting old, I
shall perhaps wake up one of these days,
when I can see a little better, and say things
in a manner that, while not closely resembling
the manner I once used, will at least appear
on the record and be an indication that I was
not altogether a dead one at eighty.

SMALL LOANS

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill Z, an Act respecting
Small Loans.
He said: Honourable senators, for the
second time I now submit a Bill respecting
small loans, the subject-matter of which was
before the Senate two years ago, when its
underlying principles were carefully studied.
I am not quite sure what procedure we
followed when our Committee on Banking
and Commerce reported on two private bills
promoted by loan companies, and the general
bill frorn the Department of Finance, which
had been referred to that committee for
examination. At that time the Department
of Finance felt that no headway could be
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

made with the private bills until the House
of Commons dealt with the matter generally
through a special or standing committee. The
other House was not then ready to take
action on a general bill, because it was not
informed of the conditions under which small
loans were made throughout the country. It
was a violent shock to its members to be
asked to authorize loans at 2 per cent per
month, or 24 per cent per year, and no
progress could be made until the subjectmatter was studied. The House of Commons had an opportunity of making that study
last session. Now an atmosphere has been
created which allows the Department of Finance to come forward with this Bill in the
hope that the two branches of Parliament
will accept it.
As the matter is fairly technical, I shall
simply read two clauses of the Bill giving
the reason for and the scope of the proposed
legislation. This is the preamble:
Whereas it has become the common practice
for money-lenders to make charges against
borrowers claimed as discount, deduction from
an advance, a commission, brokerage, chattel
mortgage and recording fees, fines and penalties, or for inquiries, defaults or renewals,
which, in truth and substance are, in whole
or in part, compensation for the use of money
loaned or for the acceptance of the risk of
loss or are so mixed with such compensation
as to be indistinguishable therefrom and are,
in some cases, charges primarily payable by
the lender but required by the lender to be
paid by the borrowers; and whereas the result
of these practices is to add to the cost of the
oan without increasing the nominal rate of
interest charged so that the provisions of the
law relating to interest and usury have been
rendered ineffective: Therefore His Majesty,
by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate and the House of Commons of Canada,
enacts as follows.
The second clause contains this definition,
among others:
In this Act, unless the context otherwise
requires,
(a) "cost" of a loan means the whole of the
cost of the loan to the borrower whether the
same is called interest or is claimed as discount, deduction from an advance, commission,
brokerage, chattel mortgage and recording fees,
fines, penalties or charges for inquiries, defaults or renewals or otherwise, and whether
paid to or charged by the lender or paid to or
charged by any other person, and whether fixed
and determined by the loan contract itself, or
in whole or in part by any other collateral
contract or document by which the charges, if
any, imposed under the loan contract or the
terms of the repayment of the loan are effeetively varied.
I need not go through the other clauses,
nor point out the difficulties the Finance
Department had to meet in bringing the
measure within the scope of our federal
powers. I suggest that after the Bill has been
given second reading it be referred to the

MARCH 30, 1939
Banking and Commerce Committee for
examination and report. I say this advisedly,
because the membership of that committee is
virtually as it was two years ago, when we
bad the samne matter before us and studied
it for upwards of a month.
1 think that there will be no occasion to
sumamon outside parties to give us advice.
0f course, anyone who desires to lay bis
views before the commiittee will be welcome.
The subi ect-matter bas been studied fromn ail
angles by the incorporated -ban companies.
One of the main difficulties was the maximum
rate to 'be abbowed, but I helieve they have
now become re.conciled to the idea of flot
requesting that the maximum be increased
fromn 24 per cent to 30 per cent. I may say
that in the United States there are several
state enactments which allow a maximum rate
on small loans of 30 per cent, and even a
little more in some states. The Superintendent
of Insurance has repeatedly declared that the
incorporated boan companies can continue in
the 'business at a maximum of 24 per cent.
In those circumstanc'es I do not think we shall
be called upon to give so mucb time to the'
Bill as we did two years ago.
Witli this short explanation I move the
second reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGHEN: Honourable mem-bers, this is a subject which,
as the leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) says, we bave deait with very
thoroughly and very extensively over a
prolonged period, and consequently one with
which we are quite familiar. I am very glad
the Government have seen fit to bring ini a
measure of their own, and to introduce it in
this House. I commend them, for doing so.
It is unfortunate that the Minister of Trade
and Commerce is flot here with one of bis
moving picture cameras to get this statement
of mine immnortalized, as would be expected
by the senator fromn Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris.)
Had the Bill come to us earlier, we prohably
couid have made progress with it during the
slack period; but even yet we shahl have
plenty of opportunity to do justice to it.
I have read it tbrough and cannot see tbat
it differs substantially from the Bili wbich,
after many months of work, finally emerged
from our Banking and Commerce Committee
two years ago. According to my recollection,
the maximum rate of interest is fractionally
lower. That may bie practîca;ble now; I do
not know. If it does flot mean extinction of
the competing smaller companies and centralization of the entire field in the one very large
concern, then of course it is ail to the good.

Whether or flot the extinction of the smaller
companies would be an insuperabie objection,
I should not 'be prepared to say now.
The Bill also differs from the carlier one
in that it retains the Money Lenders Act;
that is to say, it retains the 12 per cent
maximum. That retention, accompanied by
the enactment of a 24 per cent maximum
inclusive of ail charges, simply means that ail
other charges in boan agreements will have to
take a namne other than that of interest. This
presents no great difficulty.
This Billi s entitled "the Small Loans Act."
I do not know just what the Government have
in mind in swinging away fromn the interest
titie into the boans titie. I would caîl the
attention of the Government to the change.
It may be important. We have jurisdiction
in interest, but under the steadily restricting
decîsions of the Privy Council, I am afraîd
of our position in this boan field until doctrines
recently promulgated on bigb authority are
gîven statutory effect. It may be worth wbile
to have that point submnitted again. I cannot
but think the change was made after deliberation, for surely the Government would not
swing from interest to boans untbinkingly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
when I received the draft Bibi the titie was,
"An Act respecting Charges on Smali Loans."
Then I was asked to strike out the words
"Charges on." We may discuss that in comnmittee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
bebieve the Governiment have considered the
constitutional view. This Bill is entitled, "An
Act respecting Smnall Loans," and in that you
serve notice that you are outside your field.
I wiii make no other comment tban this.
When our Bill went to the Commons there
were minds startled at the tbought that we
couid possibiy suggest anything bike two
per cent a month. The resuit bas been that
for two years the boan sbark bas had a
paradise in Canada and we have been flooded
with ail kinds of newspaper indictments of
the boan sbark and demands to curb bim. Had
our work been appreciated and the Bill been
passed two years ago, money would bave
been saved to many poor people of this, Dominion whose necessities were preyed upon
by tbe boan sbark. Then., after a couple of
years, it would have been possible, if it were
considered safe, to reduce the maximum.
Anotber Bill would bave done it. Canada
bas lost because the, Commons thougbt our
long, bard work was not well done. It was
well done.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SENATE
PEST CONTROL PRODUCTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 40. an Act to amend the
Agricultural Pests Control Act and change
the title thereof.
He said: Honourable senators, I need only
say that there are a number of amendments
to the Agricultural Pests Control Act contained in this Bill. The general purpose of
the Bill is to provide for such amendments
to the Act as twelve yoars of experience in
its administration would indicate are necessary for its further successful operation. I do
not intend to dilate upon these various amendments, but will move the second reading, and,
with the consent of the Senate. will have the
Bill confided to the Committee on Agriculture.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, as the leader of the House
knows. quite a number of amendments to
this Bill have been suggested by Parliamentary
Counsel. They will of course be brought before the committee.
I rise only to say that there has been little
done in Canada more valuable than the work
in pst control. A ouniber of important instances can be cited. not the loast being the
control that bas becn obtained in a pretty
effective way over rust. This work is in
the natural and proper field of government,
and no bill to enlarge tie efficient operation
of a department that has provecd its worth
will eser meet opposition from me. Again
I commend the Administration.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second tine.

That was gone into between the sponsors of
li Bill and our Parliamuentary Counsel, Mr

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, a message bas been received from
the' House of Commons returning Bill H, an
Act respectinig the United Church of Canada,
with an amendment to which they desire the
concurrence of the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I move concurrence in the amendment. It strikes out the clause wbich would
postpone the coming into force of the Act
until it was proclaimed.
Right Hlon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Good.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will be
reealled that on account of that clause being
in the présent Bill, it was inserted in the
Presbyterian Church Bill, which was sponsored
by the honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif). Thougli I was sponsor of
the présent Bill, I have to admit that I neyer
knew why it contaîned that clause. I assumed
there was some reason why the coming into
force sbould be delayed, and, as this was not
vital to the measure, I said notbing. I believe there is an amendment from the other
House to strike out the same clause from the
Presbyterian Church Bill, too.
The motion was agreed to.

DEBATES 0F THE SENATE-FRENOR
EDITION (UNREVISED)
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the honourable gentleman from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) last week complained of delay in the printing of the French
version of the Debates of the Senate. I asked
the Clerk of the Senate to ascertain whether

SENATE
there had been any dilatoriness in the Bureau
for Translations. I have recnived from him
the following letter:
March 31, 1939.
Re the Debates of the Senate,
French Edition (Unrevised)
On Thursday, March 30, Senator Sauvé made
the following statement in the Senate:
"I take this opportunity of pointing out that
the French language is too frequently ignored
in connection with documents of the Senate.
For instance, the French edition of the Debates
of the Senate arrives most of the time five or
six days later than the English edition. This
should not be tolerated. In the Senate, as in
the House of Commons, the French language
enjoys constitutional rights, and I insist upon
their recognition."
As you are doubtless aware, the translation
of the Debates of the Senate is carried out by
the Bureau for Translations, which functions
entirely independently of the Senate staff.
Hereto annexed is a memorandum, which I
have obtained from the Joint Distribution
Office of Parliament, setting out in detail the
dates of distribution of the French Hansard
from the beginning of the present session to
the 29th instant.

Clerk of the Senate.

Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: Honourable senators. I fail to understand why the French
version of Senate Hansard should not be
delivered at the same time as the English
version, or not later than a day after the
English is distributed. Wlen I Lad the
honour of being Speaker of this House I agreed
to our translators being incorporated in the
Bureau for Translations on the assurance that
the French version should be delivered within
a day after the appearance of the English
version.
As I understand, the explanation for the
delay is that extra time is required for the
work of translation and printing. I do not
wish to blame the Bureau for Translations,
but I still wonder what justification there can
be for not living up to the assurance given
nie at the time the change to which I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

referred was made. I should like to hear from
a representative of the Bureau for Translations as to why the delay continues.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will draw the
attention of the director of the Bureau to the
remarks of my honourable friend. It will be
observed from the information given by' the
Clerk of the Senate that the Bureau has, in
part, made good the assurance given to our
former Speaker, but I will ask if there are
any special reasons why there is sometimes
a delay of two or three days.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: I think it will
be found that the delay occurs at the Printing
Bureau.
In other words, the Bureau for
Translations sends the French version to the
Printing Bureau, where there is some delay
in getting the printed copies for distribution.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: There always was
some trouble at the Printing Bureau.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There may be
this further reason, that we are not always
prompt in correcting and returning the proof
sheets.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL'S REPORTTRANSLATION AND DISTRIBUTION

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Last week
my honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Sauvé) complained that the French version
of the report of our Law Clerk respecting the
British North America Act had not yet
appeared in French, although it had been
distributed in English.
I may inform the
honourable gentleman that the Law Clerk did
not finish his report until the 15th of March,
and therefore could not, before that date, give
any order for its translation, even had he
been authorized to do so. Such authority
could come only from His Honour the Speaker
or from this House. It will take a long time
to complete the translation.
It was only
through the good will of His Honour the
Speaker, who authorized the printing of the
report as it was being produced, in English,
that soon after its completion copies were
ready for distribution. In order, if need be,
to cover his action, and to save time, I move:
That authority be granted for the printing
of blank copies in EnglishI do not know what number His Honour the
Speaker agreed to have printed.
-and
two hundred copies in French of the
report by the Parliamentary Counsel of the
Senate relating to the enactment of the British
North America Act, 1867, and that rule 100
be suspended in so far as it relates to the said
printing.

APRIL 5, 1939
I may say that I have asked the Bureau for
Translations to hasten work on the French
version. I will keep an eye on its progress.
A certain number of men must be detailed to
carry on the translation, and, if necessary, I
will see that their number is added to.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn told that
1,000 copies in English are being ordered.
lion. Mr. DANDTJRAND:- Then it will be
1,000 copies in English and 200 copies in
French.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Does the honourable
gentleman think 200 copies in French are
sufficient? Personally I doubt it very mucli.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND: I consulted the
gentleman who is engaged on - the printing of
the French version before I decided on the
200, b3ut I arn ready to say 250.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Members of the Legisiature of Quebec may each require a copy, and
I think we should send it to them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then we could
say 300 copies in French.
The motion was agreed to.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
.FIRST READING

Bill 73, an Act for gra.nting to lis Majesty
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial, year endîng 31st March, 1940.Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
lie said: With the leave of the Senate I
would move the second reading now. Probwbly
I should give an explanation of the necessity
of passing this Bill as rapidly as possible, and
an outline of wvhat is involved in this interim
supply.
It must be remembered that April is now
well along and we have to provide for salaries,
and also for certain payments under the Relief
Acts. This Bill provides for one-sixth of al
the items in the main and supplementary
estimates. Then an additional one-third is asked
for, in order to cover parliamentary expenditures, which, as honourable members know,
are flot on an average monthly basis, but
accumulate in the months during which Parliament is in session. In addition, we are
asking for one-haîf of one vote under the
Secretary of State, in order to provide for
general expenses in connection with the visit
to Canada of Their Majesties, and one-haIf
of a Transport vote in the same connection.
That is what is provided for in the Bill
before us.
I- need not say that the passing of this
interim Supply Bill in no way affects the
right of any honourable member to debate,
discuss and decide upon any item contained in
any of the estimates of wbich a portion ie now
asked.
If honourable members of the Senate will
look at the Bill they will find that under
clause 2 there is an item covering an expenditure of $45,095,590.78. Under clause 3 there

142

SENATE

is an additional interim vote of $567,471.83.
Clause 4 covers an additional interim vote
of $212,500 granted for 1939-40 on certain
items, and clause 5 an additional interim
vote of $20.389,783 granted for 1939-40 on certain items. Clause 6 provides:
A detailed account of the sums expended
under the authority of this Act shall be laid
before the House of Commons of Canada during
the first fifteen days of the then next session
of Parliament.
With these explanations I move the second
reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this interim Supply Bill is
somewhat unusual, in the proportion which
Parliament is asked to grant.
Section 4 authorizes an extra appropriation
of one-half of the amount of each of the items
set forth in Seliedule B. A glance at the
purpose of these estimates, relating entirely
to expense connected with the visit of Their
Majesties, which will occur very shortly, makes
it very plain that the request is quite
reasonable.
I presume that clause 2 refers to the main
estimates. One-sixth of the entire amount
of these estimates is there voted. Then, under
section 3, one-third of the sums set out in
scliedule A is voted in addition to the onesixth, making a proportion of one-half of the
total. As to schedule B, 'the one-half of the
amoun-ts mentioned there plus the one-sixth
covered by clause 2, means an appropriation
of two-thirds of those anounts.
To put it succinctly, the Bill provides for
voting one-half of the main estimates. except those associated with the royal visit,
and two-thirds of the estimates in so far as
they relate to that visit. I have never before
seen an initial interim estimate covering onehalf. The proportion of the main estimates
is very large. Why is it so large? So far as
the royal visit is concerned, I take no exception to the vote at al., because it might
justifiably include the whole amount.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I repeat the
explanation as given by the Minister of
Finance:
This resolution provides for one-sixth of ail
items in the main and supplementary estimates.
That is two inonths.
Then an additional one-third is asked for, to
cover parliamentary expenditures, which, as
honourable members know, are not on an average monthly basisRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
far more.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

But it covers

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
but which accumulate in the months during
which Parliament is in session. Then we are
asking an additional one-half of one vote under
the Secretary of State, in order to provide for
general expenses in connection with the visit
to Canada of Their MajestiesRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
That explanation is not complete. I omit schedule
B. Schedule A, as respects which one-half
is asked-one-sixth plus one-third-includes
more than the legislative expenses.
The
legislative expenses amount to $866,415.50,
but there is a further item of S836,000, which
lias nothing to do with the costs of the
Senate and the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I fail to sec
that there is an overlapping in that expenditure. Schedule A says:
Based on the main estimates, 1939-40. The
amount hereby granted is $567,471.83, being onethird of the amount of each item in the said
estimates as contained in this schedule.
And further:
Sums granted to His Majesty by this Act
for the financial year ending 31st March, 1940,
and the purposes for which they are granted.
So this would cover one-third of the amount
of each item in the estimates as contained in
the schedule.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know. But
the House is being asked to vote two montlis'
supply all round-which is not unusujal, although formerly it was more often onetwelfth-and in addition, one-half in respect
of the Commercial Intelligence Service vote
of S836,000 appearing in schedule A. It can
be understood that the expenses of the Senate
and the House of Commons are not spread
evenly over the year, and it is not unreasonable to ask a large share of that amount;
but why so large a proportion of the Commercial Intelligence Service vote?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As to the Commercial Intelligence Service vote I do not
know exactly what is tlie total amount appearing in the main or supplementary estimates;
so I am at a loss to say why it is more than
one-third; but I should take it for granted
that tiat would be one-third exclusiveRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. There
is an extra one-sixth. making it one-half
altogether.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
Or course, ail
I can he governed by is th statement that it
is one-third.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
It is more.
Perhaps the Minister of Agriculture has asked
this as a special favour to the Minister of
Trade and Commerce.

APRIL 5,1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I doubt it,
because the Commercial Intelligence Service
would be under Hon. Mr. Euler, Minister of
Trade and Commerce.

exercised supervisory and controli mc powers

when flic level has been above a certain

point, and, I thought the saine board haid
supervision in respect of Rainv L.ake. This
Bill provides that the International Joint
Commission shail have control of Rainy Lake
in emergent conditions.
WXeli, there are
emergent conditions when the level is above
a certain point and also when it is below a
certain point. Even if I arn wrong in thinking- that the existing board had control in
respect of Rainy Lake, it strikes me fhat if,
and not the International Joint Commission,
would be the right body to have control, just
as it has over the Lake of the Woods. ,I
shouid like the honourabie leader f0 tell me

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think that
the point mentioned by my right honourable
friend is covered in the convention which will
be submitted to the Senate. However, I shall
endeavour to have to-morrow the information
hie has requested.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable members, I arn wondering whether the waters of
Rainy Lake that run into Raîny River are
in any way affected. As I understand the
situation, there is a big power house at Fort
Frances, in Ontario, or International Falls,
across the American border. Nearly ail the
power developed is used on the American side.
The question occurs to me whether this Bill
bas anything to do with the development of
the electrical power that goes across the line.
The motion was agreed to.
MEAT AND CANNED FOODS BILL

far as Canada may bave an interest in the
ordnance land affected, but the other parcel has
nothing to do with ordnance land. Our jurisdiction in railway matters does not carry to
the extent of enabling us to determine a civil
right so as to cure a defeet in titie.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHIAM: What is the
trouble?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Some land,
once British and then Canadian ordnance,
was for many years used by the Grand Trunk.
The Grand Trunk conveyed it to the Toronto
Terminais Railway Company, and there is a
question of titie in respect to it. So far as
Canada may still be the owner, Canada
can of course convey the property. But as to
the other case I cannot sea where Canada
cornes in. This measure is an attempt by
Parliament to cure a defeet in title in some
railway lands.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:- Is it not al

in Toronto? What was originally ordnance
land close to the water is now away back
frorn the water line. Acres and acres have
been filled in ail aiong the front. My understanding is that this reclaimed area now
becomes ordnance land. Presumably this
Bill is an attempt to clear up any question
of tithe respecting the land reclaimed along
the shore of Lake Ontario.

in respect of grain, but if I apprehend the

grain, prestinably under our jurisdiction in

It may appear that in the chain of movements

foreign markets there is a link which is vital.
Without hav ing studied the point, I simply
throw ont the suggestion that since we have
as:ýumed authority over the movement of
grain frorn one province, acrnss another, and on

duty. If there is a stoppage in transitu at
Winnipeg, it may ho deemed propor to take

CANADA-UNITED STATES TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 64, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and the United States of America.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
is entitled, "an Act respecting a certain Trade
Agreement between Canada and the United
States of America." It might just as well
bear another name, which would be quite
familiar to the people of Canada, for many
campaigns have been carried on in this country with respect to reciprocity treaties with
the United States.
Let us glance at these conventions. We
had had the reciprocity treaty of 1854-66,
which for a number of years had so developed
our trade with our neighbours that the eyes
of Canadians were turned towards our
southern border in the hope that this treaty
would be resurrected. After 1866 a number
of delegations from various governments, both
Conservative and Liberal, went to Washington, but came back empty-handed.
In 1891, after the United States tariff wall
had been raised unduly and somewhat cruelly
against our goods, there was considerable
agitation in Canada, which then consisted
mainly of Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, in favour of closer commercial relations with the United States.
The Liberal party, which was in opposition,
felt that the denial by the Washington
authorities of reciprocity in natural products
justified this country in widening the scope of
a proposed agreement so that it would be
satisfactory to the United States, and at the
elections of 1891 the Liberals submitted to our
people the policy of unlimited reciprocity. The
situation in Canada was very difficult because
of the increased duties. Before Parliament
was dissolved Sir John A. Macdonald had
suggested that another effort should be made
to secure reciprocity in natural products only.
The election results in 1891 bore out his view,
and the policy of the Liberal party was rejected.
We had to wait twenty years before another
effort was made at reciprocity with the United
States. In 1911 the Taft-Fielding Convention
was submitted to the people. At that time
the Conservative opposition, which twenty
years before had favoured reciprocity in
natural products, raised its voice against
that policy, as embodied in the treaty of 1911,
and succeeded in having it rejected. Of
course, many other questions were submitted
to the people at the same time, but in the
result the Taft-Fielding Convention went by
the board.

147

At last, after another period of twenty
years, there was unanimity in the two parties
in favour of closer relations with the United
States. The Bennett Government, as I will
call it-or the Conservative party-endeavoured to obtain some kind of reciprocal
arrangement with our neighbours to the south.
The correspondence of 1934 clearly shows it.
In April, 1933, Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Bennett
issued this joint statement:
We have agreed to begin a search to increase
the exchanges of commodities between our two
countries and thereby promote not only economic
betterment on the North American continent,
but also the general improvement of world
conditions.
In the election campaign of 1935 both
parties expressed themselves as favourable to
closer commercial relations with the United
States. In November of that year, hardly
three weeks after the present Government
came into office, an agreement was signed with
the United States, and in the following year
it was submitted to this Parliament for confirmation. As honourable members will recall, it was discussed at length here. In that
agreement both parties expressed the wish
that it should be enlarged as soon as possiblea wish that the present convention puts into
effect.
The time chosen for bringing about an enlargement of the 1935 convention was
psychologically favourable. Our then existing
convention with the United States was due to
end on the 31st of December last, and our
agreement with Great Britain was due to end
in 1940. Great Britain and the United States
in 1937 had opened negotiations tending to a
trade agreement. Great Britain approached
not only Canada, but all the Dominions, and
asked if they would not be willing to cooperate towards reaching an agreement with
the United States. It was understood at the
time that if we did facilitate such an agreement the United States would be ready to enlarge its convention with us and to compensate us for whatever sacrifices might be
entailed through alteration of the Ottawa
agreement. The interest of Canada, when
thus approached by Great Britain, was quite
evident. If we had refused to co-operate, I
wonder what would have happened when the
time came to renew the two conventions which
were soon to end: that with the United States
on the 31st of December, 1938, and that with
Great Britain in 1940. The whip would not
have been in our hands then. I do not mean
that Great Britain or the United States would
have displayed any ill-will towards us, but the
fact would have been remembered that when
we had been requested to facilitate a triangular agreement we had declined.

148

SENATE

In this matter Canada's interest necessitated an international outlook.
It is in
Canada's interest to develop its trade abroad.
We are an exporting country. We need, so
far as it is possible to get them, lowered
barriers. In fact, the world at large is in
need of restoration of normal economie conditions. This was the opinion of President
Roosevelt and Mr. Bennett in 1933. What
did we obtain in return for agreeing to the
suggestion that we should contribute something towards closer commercial relations
between Great Britain and the United States?
Among the evident advantages, I should say,
was a stabilization of our own trade conditions. I will net take time now to stress the
importance of a stable fiscal policy. But I
have heard it urged right and left, by all the
writers who interest themselves in economic
conditions, that it is one of the vital things
at which every country should aim.
We are assured under this convention that
there will be no disturbance of our relations
with the United States, nor, I need not add,
with Great Britain either. I believe that any
change brouglt about by the convention up
to the beginning of the present year was for
:he better; and this will continue to be true
lhrouglout this year and in 1940.
I consider that our 1935 convention with
Washington benefited us very appreciably.
The present one grants us important additional concessions. That is, it not only renews all the concessions we obtained in 1935,
but also contains a large number of entirely
new ones. The 1935 agreement allowed tariff
reductions on 63 items entering the United
States market, but the new agreement includes 129 tariff reductions affect ing trade
valued in 1937 at $72,981,000. There is also
an increase in the bindings of existing United
States rates of duty from 32, allowed in 1935,
to 41, affecting a total trade valued in 1937
at $51,843,000. Furthermore, the 1935 agreement contained a number of quotas limiting
the imports allowed at reduced rates of duty.
Where it appeared that these quotas restricted Canadian exports, this new agreement
provides for a complete removal of the quota
or allows a substantial increase.
Lastly,
existing free entry was bound on 20 items in
1935, and the new convention increases that
number to 32.
The following are some of the principal
concessions to Canada in the new trade agreement:
Agricultural products: maximum reduction
in duty on an enlarged quota in the case of
heavy cattle; enlarged tariff quota for calves;
maximum reductions in the duties on cream
and milk; further reduction in duty on cheese
-this is very important; further reduction
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

in the duty on horses; reductions in the duties
on oats, barley, rye, buckwheat and products
made therefrom; reductions in the duties on
various kinds of feeds, fresh and frozen blueberries, clover and grass seeds, certified seed
and table potatoes, hay, maple sugar and
maple syrup, and silver or black fox furs or
skins.
Fishery products: reductions in duty covering almost the entire range of production of
fish.
Forest products: removal of the requirenient that imported lumber should be marked
with country of origin; removal of tariff quota
applicable to imports, at reduced rates of
duty, of Douglas fir and Western hemlock
lumber; more favourable arrangement regarding imports of red cedar shingles; reduced
duties on a variety of woodenware articles;
and on uncoated printing paper, hanging
paper, tissue papers and crepe paper.
Minerals and metals: reduced duties on a
large number of tlem. I will net enumerate
them.
Chemicals: the same.
Manufactured goods: binding of frec entry
for agricultural implements, and reduced duties
on patent leather; horschide and cowlide
gloves; skating boots; pipe organs; yachts;
hose; wire cloth; axles; iron castings; moulders' patterns; iron and steel chains; electrie
stoves and ranges; electric washing machines;
and waste.
In addition to the benefits which will be
derived by Canadian exporters from the
reductions in United States duties provided
for in the new Canada-United States trade
agreement, there are a great many concessions
in the trade agreement between the United
Kingdom and the United States which will
facilitate Canadian trade. Some of these are:
books; abrasives; sole leather; side upper
leather; collar, bag and case leathers; grained
leather; boots and shoes; numerous textile
items; dressed furs; kippered herring; biscuits;
jellies, jams and marmalades; ginger ale, and
so on.
The Liberal party when in power in the
past has striven to relieve implements of production from customs duties, so as to assist
producers and consumers alike. Again in this
agreement there are tariff reductions on various kinds of producers' machinery and tools.
Farmers are benefited by reductions made in
the duties on cream separators, dairy and
creamery equipment, dairy hollow-ware, manufactured fertilizers of all kinds, sprays and
insecticides, root and garden seeds, and practically all the hand tools used by the farmers,
fruit growers and dairymen.

APRIL 18, 1939
The mining industry will benefit from the
lower duties on ore and rock crushers, stamp
mills, rock drills., coal cutters, and other
articles of mining and metallurgical equipment. Reductions in the rates on diesel and
semi-diesel engines and other heavy machinery will also be useful to the mining industry,
as well as to sawmills.
The lumbering and sawmill industries will
benefit from the lower duties on locomotives
and cars for use in sawmills. And fishermen
will benefit from reduced rates on various
kinds of tackle, net floats and steel trolling
wire.
The. Canadian home also will benefit from
the reductions on many articles of household
equipment. In this list are: glass tableware
and other cut-glass-ware, kitchen and other
hollow-ware of aluminum, 'clothes wringers,
electric and other refrigerators, furniture of
wood or metal, rugs and carpets, linoleum
and oilcloth. The Canadian office will gain
from the reductions on typewriters and other
office equipment.
Still other important reductions are made
on raw chemicals, tinplate, stainless steels,
steel pipes, aircraft and parts for use in the
manufacture of aireraft, dynamos, generators
and electrie motors of all kinds, electrie precision instruments, steel castings and frames
for locomotives and tenders, steel pulleys, together with a general cut of 50 per cent in the
duties on all enumerated machinery of iron or
steel of a class or kind not made in Canada.
Every province benefits by freer entry to the
American market. True, we had of necessity
to make some concessions, but the Government have not lost sight of Canadian interests.
I make bold to affirm that Canadian industry
as a whole has shown that it favours such a
convention. This agreement, which covers so
many thousands of products imported into
Canada, bas met with very few complaints.
Tariff reductions are not necessarily sacrifices
by the country that makes them. On the contrary, they are in many instances highly
profitable. The Liberal party, as honourable
senators who hear me know, bas stood for a
lower and generally for a moderate tariff. The
present Government, when they went to the
people in 1935, so expressed themselves. That
was no new doctrine, for the Liberal party
had put it into practice for years past.
In many of the tariff concessions made the
consumer stands to gain materially. This is
in fact the most radical reconstruction we
have had in the last quarter of a century. It
will be noticed that all the modifications are
downward. I may say that the same principle
prevails in the agreement between Great
Britain and the United States; all the tariff
concessions on both sides are downward.

149

This agreement goes much beyond the
borders of our respective markets. The mostfavoured-nation principle is embodied in this
convention. This policy used to be keenly
debated, and I have heard eloquent speakers
in this Chamber discussing the advantages or
disadvantages of the most-favoured-nation
treatment accorded to a particular country,
but which extended to certain other countries
as well.
Now I feel that again we are meeting on
common ground, because at the last election
both parties were in accord on this point.
Here is an excerpt from a letter which Mr.
Herridge, on behalf of the Bennett Government, wrote to the United States Administration:
I am authorized to put forward the following
outline as a suitable basis for the negotiation
of a trade agreement.
The mutual concession of tariff treatment as
favourable as that accorded to any other foreign
country; this means that Canada would extend
to the United States its intermediate tariff
involving reductions from the present rates of
duty on some 700 items, including both natural
and manufactured products, together with a
number of further reductions below the intermediate tariff rates through the extension to
the United States of concessions made by Canada in trade conventions with foreign countries.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: What date was
that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The autumn of
1934, if I am not mistaken.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I wonder what
he would say to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The same thing.
True it is that we give advantages to other
countries by reason of that agreement, but
one must not lose sight of the fact that it
is reciprocal. We have that same advantage
with thirty countries; their concessions to
other countries are assured to us automatically.
Fears were expressed concerning our apples
and our wheat in the British market. The
Minister of National Revenue, who represents
the Annapolis Valley, dispelled such fears.
His people are quite satisfied with the advantages they find in this convention. As to
wheat, I am not qualified to discuss the somewhat technical and complex question concerning our abandonment of the six-cent preference which we enjoyed in the British market.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
change in the tariff on wheat as between us
and the United States?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. But we
abandon our advantage in the British market.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am aware
of that, but I was just wondering where free
wheat had gone.

trade in its vital features, we shauld Se
Setter off as we were. Neyertheless there
is a great deal ta Se said at this time for any
treaty which does something ta remave any
barrier ta the general flow of world trade.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Mac ARTHUR: HeaT, hear.
IRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Secondly,
there is something ta Se said for a treaty
whîch, at this crisis in the world's history,
enables an agreement ta Se made in respect
of trade or anything else as Setween Great
Britain and the United States. Speaking solely
for myself, I should Se prepared ta sacrifice
some commercial advantage ta gain thase
ends. I arn satisfied we do make a sacrifice.
The honaurable leader of the bouse reads us
a long list of articles and says, "Why, we now
get a Sigger market in the United States for
those articles." We do get somewhat lower
duties for a considerable list of articles. Needless ta say, we do not get those for nothing.
We give very substantial concessions for them;
such concessions that the Minister of National
Revenue tells us, "We are giving the United
States some big things, and they are not going
ta Se such fools as ever ta cancel this agreement." That is how he views those concessions. Then the honourable leader of the
bouse says: "We are reducing the tariff on
mining machinery. Look at the goad that is
going ta do this country. We are reducing
the tariff on farrn implements, and we shaîl
Senefit fromn that." Those are concessions
ta the United States of Amnerica. If they are
alsa a Senefit ta us, why nat wipe out the
whole tariff? What a gloriaus paradise we
should enter at once!
An bon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would Se
the easiest thing in the world ta do. If the
argument of the honourable leader of the

tariff at aIl.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was ta

industrial activity in Canada to-day. While
we may Se able to stand these concessions~
in many cases perhaps we can-it is the
utmost folly to talk of thern as an advantage
to our country. But if they are an advantage,
then the Government are merely playing the
part of a blind child in not wiping the tariff
out at one stroke.
These are concessions, and very substantial
concessions. The Minister of Mines and
Resources says we do not lose anything by
giving up an advantage af six cents a bushel
on aur wheat in the market which sJbsorbs
almast ail the export wheat of this country.
That advantage na sooner was in effect than
we virtually monopolized the export of wheat
from this North American continent ta Great
Britain. The United States almost last its
market there. Arn 1 ta listen ta the Minister
of Mines and Resourees telling me that that
was na gaod ta Canada? When did he reach
the Olympian heights ta Se able ta talk in
that manner? That is a ibig concession, and
we have ta get a great deal if we are ta be
compensated for it.
The honourable gentleman opposite (Han.
Mr. Dandurand) says: "In 1911 many other
matters were brought up and we lost the
election, 'but the proposed arrangement was a
reciprocity agreement just as týhis is." Daes
he compare this treaty with the 1911 treaty?
Not a member of this present Government

similar confession about this trade pact.
It was never anticipated that this treaty
with the United States would bring about a
Utopia; but it places every part of the
Dominion in an advantageous position. There
must be give and take in these matters.
As to the six cents a bushel advantage on
wheat, some of the Western members can
speak with more assurance than I can. But
I know there is a quid pro quo. When the
right honourable gentleman pits his intellectual
aibility, which is unquestioned, against that
of the experts in the Tariff Department, does
he consider that they figured on these things
for months, and concluded that certain concessions would be advantageous to Canada? As
the right honourable gentleman admits, there
are more than dollars and cents to be considered, and the removal of barriers to world
trade is in itself an important feature.
The right honourable gentleman mentioned
pulp, but he did not mention cattle nor the
Maritime Provinces' trade in potatoes. Thirty
years ago we had more people in Prince Edward Island than we have to-day, and if we had
not been fooled by the flag waving in 1911

current facts, in the light of the past, will
show thaf. it was jîxstifiecl, as bas been stated
not only in the great officiai press of Germany,
but by able men, university professors and
others, in America and England.
Enmity between two neighbouring states is
neyer desirable, much less between two countries where the only physical separation is an
imaginary line, a neglected fence often broken
tbrough because of the inevitable need for
mutual contacts. That is why botb great
parties in Canada have not only endeavoured
to keep up pleasant social relationships with
the United States, but have tried to obtain
reciprocai trade agreements, adequate for the
country's interests according to the interpretation and direction of the policies of the respective parties. It bias been a question of
more or ]ess limited policies, based on the
irîterests of our young country as well as on
our need for protection against the influence
of our migbty neighbour.
For it is sîndeniable tbagt the dloser the
trade relations, between two neiglibouring
countries are..the dloser will be their social
contacts, the more extensive the cifects of
neighibourliness, and the more powerful tbe

Will it be settled by the R*oosevelt-King
political party? If so, how will they settie

Or will it act as the interested third party

In the officiai statement to the press as
well as in the preamble to the CanadaUnited States trade agreement, the Canadian
Government state that the object of this
agreement, signed on November 17, 1938, is
"to facilitate and extend stili further the
commercial relations existing between Canada
and the United States of America by granting
reciprocal concessions and adv.antages for the
promotion of trade.'" And it was aiso stated
in the press that in order to make possible
the treaty between England and the United
States it was necessary to revise the 1932
trade agreements, which Canada had been so
happy as to obtain at the Ottawa Conference.
At Washington's request London asked

yielded promptly to the request of England
and the will of the United States, as they
wished to avoid all possibilities of limîtîng,
even in the least degree, reciprocity between
the two countries. This, in short, is the gist
of paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 of the officiai statement to the press regarding what the review
Canadian Business called "the ncw trade
triangle."
How often has it not been declared that
such reciprocity, extoiled under different
forms by the Liberal-Demnocratic parties of
North America for over a century, must lead
us to political and commercial union, and
then to complete union unless the Canadian
people caîl a hait, as they did in the past?
Will it be possible for us to caîl a hait if, as
rccently predicted by Lord Russell, English
philosopher, the United States becomes a
dictator country, controlling the whole world?
It is obvious that the Ujnited States entertain
sucb a dream. And I am inciined to apprehend the possibility, in an increasingly near
future, of a United American New World as
the most powerful of nations.

and more Canada was becoming England's

and foodstuffs. England took 40 per cent
of our exports, and was by way of replacing
tbe United States as our most important

been obstructed by the Anglo-American treaty,

last week:
With the British market becoming more and

The London Economist says that in 1929
the United States sold to the United Kingdom 22,265,900 hundredweights of wbeat, and
that in 1936, four years after the date of the
Ottawa agreements, the sales had been reduced
to 45,400 hundredweigbts. And on November 26, 1938, the same English publication,
commenting on the Anglo-American treaty,
said:
Most of the agricultural producte affected are

In these cases the effect of the agreement wil
largely be to divert a certain quantity of trade

The new Canada-United States trade agreement includes a certain protective tariff, but
most of it is not for the right season, the
seasonal protection being granted to Canadian market gardeners before or after it is
necessary. Tbe agreement takes no account
of the climatie differences which affect vegetation and production. The climate in the district of Montreal is not the same as in the

United States Government persisted in asserting their neutrality in case of a European
conflict. After the Munich accord, Hitler
congratulated President Roosevelt. Previously
the United States had fatally weakened the
League of Nations through their abstention;
alithough the formation of the League was
chiefly the work of President Wilson-another
Democratic leader-the principal collaborator
in disastrous peace treaties. Ever since the
conclusion of the treaty and the agreement
President Roosevelt has been urging the
United States to adopt an intensive armament
program-a program which impresses the
Canadian Government. He ceaselessly and
severely takes to task the Rome and Berlin
dictators. Such is his fuming and raving that
he is accused of provoking dangerous retaliation. He calls on Canada to arm. My words
do not imply acrimony towards Great Britain
and the United States; I am merely calling
attention to certain facts the Canadian Government have tried to hide among their toonumerous secrets.
I have a great deal of admiration for Mr.
Neville Chamberlain, whom I had the honour
to meet in person both in Ottawa and in
London. My opinion of him is similar to
that which I gained upon reading the
biography of Lord Salidbury, who, at the time
of his death in 1903, was recognized as one
of the most celebrated and accomplished
statesmen of the last century. It was generally
admitted that for many years Salisbury
laboured unceasingly to maintain England's
prestige in every corner of the earth. He was
a born diplomat, with a smiling and quiet
brand cf diplomacy. Unhurried, and disdaining to raise his voice, lie ever preferred to act
with moderation, finesse and faultless courtesy.
It is lie who, to a certain extent, made possible
closer relations between Great Britain and
the United States, towards which country he
continually gave evidence of the friendliest
regard. History will undoubtedly record a
similar achievement on the part of Mr. Neville
Chamberlain, now Prime Minister of Great
Britain and a powerful director of the vast

imperialistic policy conceived by his father,
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain-one of the greatest
statesmen of modern times.
The assistance offered by the United States
to Great Britain and to France would be a
great advantage were it not likely to arouse
the enmity of the triple alliance of Italy,
Germany and Japan. But is the assistance to
be relied upon? The spectacular changes of
public opinion in the United States give us
reason for doubt, and cause to fear the
American gods. The American Congress calls
the President to task in such an impressive
manner that once more he wavers.
Could Great Britain from motives of justice
and humanity have found other ways to draw
the American Republic nearer to ber without
taking away some of the preferential advantages granted at the time of the Ottawa Conference? Great Britain designed a pact likely
to secure the attachment of the whole North
American continent-a commercial pact concluded in peace time to ensure common
military participation in time of war. Through
the influence of the United States, Great
Britain wishes to secure full military participation from Canada, but without appearing to
ask for it. That is why the militant and
militarily-indlined Imperialists had so little
to say against the Canada-United States
Treaty. Compared with their violent attacks
of 1911 against the Taft-Fielding plan, the
protectionist Imperialists had very, very little
to say.
Canada is more than ever subject to
American influence. Our Prime Minister Mr.
King and several of his colleagues, for instance
Mr. Howe, received their education in the
United States. They are political friends of
the Liberal-Democratic party of which Mr.
Roosevelt styles himself the leader, and they
are followers of his doctrines. The leader of
this great dictatorial democracy is powerful
enough to deny and throw overboard those
Democrats who, like many Canadian Liberals,
are rather conservatively inclined-even more
conservative than the Conservatives, be they
Liberals or Nationalists.
If war breaks out the Government will not
try to organize a Union Cabinet with the
help of the Conservative party and the other
g.roups in the House; they will prefer to rely
on the support and influence of Mr.
Roosevelt's Democrats. With the King Government, Canada will follow in Washington's
footsteps. It would be a Washington-Ottawa
Government. This is hardly reassuring either
for those who are against Imperialists and conscription, or for those who believe in limited
participation, or for those who are in favour
of total or partial abstention-and the latter
are more numerous than is generally imagined.

158

SENATE

We shall then see a Canada-United States
union in time of war, which will quietly and
definitely develop into an American Union in
peace as well as in war time.
The Canadian Business Review in its issue
of last December says:
After President Roosevelt, at Queen's University in August, told Canada his country could
not stand idly by and see the Dominion invaded
or even threatened, Premier King at Woodbridge said this meant that Canada's obligation
was increased rather than lessened, that this
country from a sense of self-respect would have
to build a real defence system so that the
Dominion might be really deserving of help
when it was needed.
And here is another paragraph from the
Review:
Canada's defence policy must also be affected
by recent Washington happenings.
Premier
King's latest conversations with President
Roosevelt touched on defence, as well as the
seaway project and the problem of Jewish
refugees. What plan the Prime Minister submits to Parliament this session to put Canada's
defence equipment on a respectable basis vill,
to a considerable extent, be governed by what
lie learned at the White House.
My words are not prompted by animosity
towards Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. King. I entertain high esteem for Mr. King and reasonable
admiration for Mr. Roosevelt.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I even admit that it is
neither foolisli nor illogical to consider the
possibility, even the probability, of an AngloSaxon union which would include Canada and
the United States, and bring about national
unity over the whole North American continent. Indeed, the idea has been alive on our
continent for over a century. It constantly
makes new converts, even in our great colleges.
University professors raise their voices in its
defence. There is no longer talk of annexatien, as in the time of Papineau, Abbott, Galt,
Dessaulles, Fabre, Charlton, Edward Farrer,
Erastus Wyman, Goldwin Smith, John Willison
and many others. A new formula has been
adopted: ,pan-Americanism.
Anyone who
reads Edward Farrer's letters in the New York
Sun will see that most of the main problems
of Canadian policy have for over a century
more or less agitated public opinion in the
United States.
In his book on Canada, André Siegfried has
the following to say:
One might perhaps say that the existence of
a special country called Canada, as distinct from
the United States, is very nearly an historical
accident. Such separate existence is a political
paradox; nature did not endow it with particular personality and there is no geographical
difference to separate it from its great neighbour to the south.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

Mr. Paul Verner, of Montreal, graduate in
Social Sciences, in an exhaustive study of Our
Commercial Policy of To-morrow, speaks of
Canada as "an artificial country," with sparse
population massed alongside the American
boundary and the St. Lawrence, whose varied
interests, because of ber geographical situation,
make her position precarious. Mr. Verner
seems to consider free trade as the political
ideal, although he would limit it for Canada,
and adds:
The boundary is only an imaginary line and
commercial currents are established between the
neighbouring districts of the two countries more
tenacious than even the inter-Canadian currents.
The Canadian population often finds it more
advantageous to buy the products of the neighbouring States of the American Republic than
to send to the other extremities of Canada for
them. Vancouver is more intimately connected
with Seattle, even with Los Angeles, than with
Toronto or Montreal. The farmers of the
Canadian West buy a great deal from the
Anerican cities near them. There are such
tremendous distances between the ends of the
country that no one even thinks of regular and
direct exchange between the extremities of
the Dominion.
So that free trade between Canada and the
United States for all purchases not above $100
is another step towards Anglo-Amnerican union,
thanks to the Roosevelt-King policies.
Mr. Verer denounces protection. although
he finds it necessary to a certain point and in
certain circumstances. His article may be
found in a magazine
called "Actualité
Economique," the official organ of l'Ecole des
Hautes Etudes Commerciales of Montreal, this
school being affiliated with the University of
Montreal. In this most interesting magazine
young scholars find occasion to say, as well as
to read, things of importance and high educational value. Any one who reads it will see
how young Canadians get their education,
how they learn to work, or how they should
work.
Aierican policy tends towards the realization on this new continent of a great American
whole. Prosident Roosevelt gave indications
in tiat direction at the opening of the PanAmerican Conference at Buenos Avres. in
January, 1937, when he wanted to create a
League of American Nations, after his own
country caused the failure of the Geneva
League, which had at least allowed certain
of the Latin-American courntries to protect
themselves against the Washington policy-a
policy which, according to a French newspaper
writer, would for lack of counter-balance pull
those countries into its orbit. The day after
the conference Charles Lesca, a Latin-American journalist, wrote:
The United States have not abandoned the
idea of advancing their economie and even
political advantages on the rest of the conti-

APRIL 18, 1939
nent, but, with Roosevelt, they hope to get
further by coming forward as friends rather
than as school teachers armed with a big stick.
The unity of America in international matters
is now realized, at least theoretically.
At the Eighth Lima Conference, held at
Lima, Peru, in 1938, American solidarity and
the necessity of defence against aggression was
emphasized. At the same conference it was
stated that the peoples of America had brought
about "spiritual unity''-"continental solidarity,
in order to defend the peace of the continent
and universal harmony against all foreign
interference or activity which might threaten
them"; in point of fact, against the totalitarian
states. That sums up the Lima proclamation.
The United States were unable to persuade
South America to go further along the way
towards coalition after Germany played her
cards. Besides, in South America there are
sacred traditions which are jealously and
rightfully guarded.
It should not be forgotten that the Prime
Minister, the Right Hon. Mr. King. was
severely censured because Canada did not
take part in the two meetings of the PanAmerican Union. That is a' new symptom.
After stating the reasons why Canada had
not been invited, this is what the Right Hon.
Prime Minister said:
It would be possible to propose, or have a
friendly member propose, that the necessary
adjustments should be made in the constitution
and procedure of the Union to make our membership possible. Public opinion in favour of
some such course has undoubtedly increased in
recent years. I do not, however, consider that
it has yet become sufficiently widespread or
sufficiently informed and matured to warrant
immediate steps in that direction. It is a
possibility which should be given consideration
in the future, along with other means, trade and
governmental, of bringing about closer relationships between our country and those countries
which are destined to play an increasingly
significant part in the world's affairs.
That is another symptom. Are these words
not deeply significant when new alliances are
dawning in Europe and in America? I recognize that, notwithstanding the heavy Western
breezes, our sympathetic Prime Minister is
most skilful in guiding his vessel through the
His
obstructions of our political waters.
excessive fear of shoals impedes his progress,
even when circumstances would urge him to
hasten; and, to be quite loyal, I cannot say
that the country is always the worse for it,
as, for example, when he is urged to undertake the deepening of the St. Lawrence.
The dream of Lord Durham, the great
Liberal nobleman who apparently was sympathetic to French Canadians-the dream of
assimilation-is still pursued in America.
There are in the United States and Canada,
and even in Great Britain and France, as

159

there were fifty years ago, a few who believe
that the special rights granted the French
Canadians will disappear in the securing of
national unity and peace. These people believe that such unity can only be accomplished through an entirely Anglo-Saxon community in the midst of a great American
union, under the flag of Uncle Sam. Farrer's
successors think that only American institutions will succeed in making the population
of Canada wholly Anglo-Saxon; that the
nation will be all the stronger if Englishspeaking immigrants are numerous enough to
fill the Canadian West. That theory finds
disciples in Great Britain among those who
study and forecast the future of the new
world and the acute phases of the chronic
illness of old Europe. In 1934, in Paris, I
heard Siegfried speak of the "modification to
European hegemony," and of what he called,
"a sort of change in the centre of the planet's
gravity." There must, therefore, be some
plausibility in the contention of the large
body of opinion which maintains that the
English-speaking countries are by way of
making common cause, and coming to
"spiritual unity." The United States have
vital interests to safeguard and develop, and
commercial interests in the British Empire,
which reaches all parts of the globe. To
realize this it is only necessary to have an
accurate knowledge of the economic geography of the world. Our ignorance of commercial and maritime geography is a great
cause of weakness, a source of errors, of faults
and of popular prejudices, which the leaders
of the country should be the first to realize.
If we knew our country well enough to
understand fully its immediate needs and its
destiny, if we had a better knowledge of
power on land and sea, we should be better
judges of the economic strength and universality of the British Empire, and should be
better able to gauge seriously all that attaches
to it.
A correspondent of the Paris Temps, in
speaking recently of the fundamental importance of understanding the political-geographic
part played by the sea, said:
It is necessary to observe the continents from
the open sea.
How many interests are there that~we should
observe from the open sea, not in the narrow
earthbound way?
If we observed the
continents from the open sea, should we not
see more clearly the commercial current that
Canada should foflow to find outlets and
markeits, without which there can be no
economic progress? Would it not be more
profitable to look as far as the Mediterranean
than to confine ourselves to neighbourly
exchanges?

160

SENATE

(Translation) I shall now, honourable senators, conclude in French. I hope that when
Canada is annexed to the United States I shall
be in a better position to speak in English. I
deeply regret having taken up so much of the
time of the House and having abused its
patience. I note the atrmosphere, and trust
that my experience will be profitable to all.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I do not regret having suggested to
my honourable friend that he should proceed
this evening. I have followed his disquisition
on the fate of Canada, and although not sharing his fears for the morrow, I have listened
with considerable interest to his views on what
may be expected in the future.
The honourable member has spoken more
than once of the views of André Siegfried.
I nay say that his last book, "Le Canadapusaisnce int ernationale," revealed this countrv to imany Canadians who could net view
it witI the sane objectivity as did a
stranger of high culture like André Siegfried.
I an net ready to subscribe to the theories
of Mr. Siegfried in their entirety; nevertheless,
in lis book tiere is considerable food for
thought. Those who liave not read this book
-I tîhink it lias been translated into Englishwill find it a most interesting study of Canada,
past, present and future. Many readers will
probably be sonewhat surprised at some of
his conclusions, but there is much to be said
for many of them. He expresses a doubt as
to the possibility of our country remaining
autonoimous and independent of the United
States, because of the tremendous magnetic
influence of that country on a country like ours.
I am not afraid of the nagnetism of American
public men ever affecting our standing as an
autonomous country.
I do not know whether I have ever
mentioned a little incident which took place
at a banquet I was attending in New York at
a time when President Taft was signing
treaties witlh the South American republics.
Canada had just signed the Taft-Fielding
Trcaty.
At that time there was guerilla
warfare in Mexico, and Villa, one of the
captains, hiad even fired upon Americans across
the Rio Grande, and I think General Pershing
had been allowed to cross the Rio Grande in
order to try to protect residents of the
United States. I had occasion to speak before
President Taft. I said that we in Canada were
happy to sec Brother Jonathan face to face;
that in the past we had only seen his back,
as lie was constantly turned towards the south.
When President Taft rose to follow me he
said: " My friend Senator Dandurand seems
to reproach us for not having turned our face
towards Canada. He ias failed to notice that
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

this is a very great c-ompliment on our part,
in that we have net needed to protect ourselves in that direction. At the moment we
would not dare turn our back to Mexico."
Such, I think, is still the view of the leaders
of public opinion in the United States. No
one in the United States thinks of Canada but
as a partner in North America. The habits,
traditions and mentality of the two countries
are the same, and I feel that the United States
are most happy to treat us as associates, and
as associates only.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGRIEN introduced Bill
G2, an Act to incorporate Universal Eucozone

Hie said: Honourable senators, this is the
Bill which I thînk is referred to in the report
just adopted. The object of the Bill is
simply the incorporation of a company. I arn
flot very clear as ta why the sponsors wish
ta have the company încorporated by a special
Act instead of under the Companies Act, but
that is their own business. No special right
is sought.

SMALL LOANS BILL
REPORT 0F COMMTT'EE

Hofi. Mr. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill
Z, an Act respecting Smalh Loans.
Hie said: The committee recommend that at
page 4, hine 15, the following be added as subclause 7 ta clause 5:
No such licensee shail advertise by way of
radio communication in whole or in part his
business authorized by or under this Act.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senatars,
I have no objection ta make ta the Bill itsehf,
but I do object ta the proposed amendinent.

I see no gaod reason why these small loan
companies, whihe allowed ta advertise in the
newspapers or in other ways, should yet
be prohibited from advertising hy radio. They

71498-11l
SEVXBEDX5IION

162

SENATE

are carrying on a legitimate business, and
in my view the proposed amendment would
bc a reflection on their bona fides.
In the committee to-day the honourable
senator who sponsored the amendment said
that some weak women, perhaps even some
weak men, might be so influenced by radio
advertising as to borrow money in order to
buy things which they did not really need.
These companies are responsible corporations
with considerable financial backing and are
not afraid to advertise by radio or any other
means, whereas the loan sharks are about the
last persons in the world who would want to
advertise their business. There may be some
large companies doing business as loan sharks,
but the great majority of the sharks are small
men hiding away in the background, and they
wish to avoid public notice. The proposed
amendment would be a stigma on the reputable loan companies and give the loan sharks
a great advantage. This consideration alone
should warrant its rejection.
One reason for prohibiting radio advertising
might be that it would increase the overhead
costs of the small loan companies, but under
this Bill those costs mean nothing at all to
the borrower. The companies are restricted
to 2 per cent overhead to cover interest and
all their costs and other charges. Therefore,
even if they wanted to spend 1½ per cent on
advertising, they could not add one dollar
extra to their charges against the borrower.
I do not know whether the House will give
the matter much consideration, as we have
had loan bills before us for several sessions.
but to my mind this is a most important
matter. I would move that this amendment
on page 4 be not concurred in.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the Senate, honourable members, is
tiat the report recommending the amendment be concurred in. It is proposed by
Hon. Senator Hardy that the amendment be
not concurred in.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- The report
now before the House provides for an amendment to the Bill. A motion having been put
for concurrence in that amendment, all we
need do is vote yea or nay.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think the right honourable gentleman is correct. To be perfectly frank, I was not quite sure how I should
proceed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion is
that the report be adopted and the amendment concurred in. It is moved in amendment that the report be not concurred in.
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: With all
deference, Mr. Speaker. I think the question is:
Those
Shall this amendment be adopted?
who do not want to adopt the amendment
will vote nay.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure
of the House to adopt the amendment?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Mr. Speaker, I do not
think honourable members know what they
are to vote on. Three honourable senators
in this quarter do not know.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Only three!
Would you
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
allow me. Mr. Speaker, to explain the situaThe Banking and Commerce Comtion?
mittee bas reported a bill with one amendment, and the Senate has decided to discuss
the matter forthwith. Now the question is:
Shall this amendment be concurred in? So
that those who are in favour of the amendment will say "content"; those who are
against will say "non-content."
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: While on my
feet, I may say that it is very seldom I vote
against a report froin a commxïittee, but the
Department of Finance. represented by the
Superintendent of Insurance, thinks there is
nu need for the proposed amendmxent, and
J an in this dilemmta, that if I agree to the
aiendiiient J must reject the point of view of
the Department of Finance. which I represent
here. With these few remarks, I leave the
Senate to vote on the question.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I feel quite certain there is still a likelihood
of some members not clearly understanding
hvow they are voting.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is a motion on
which we are to vote yea or nay. If we vote
yea, it means that these loan companies will
not have tho privilege of using the radio for
advertising purposes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If we vote yea on this
motion. it means that these loan companies
will not b able to advertise over the radio.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By our endorsing
the amendment to that effect.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We are only getting
mixed up if we put that in. There is the
motion before usHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: To adopt
the report.

APRIL 19, 1939
Ron. Mr. CALDER:-which includes this
amendment. If we vote yea, the loan companies will flot have the privilege of using
the radio for advertising.
Han. Mr. DONNELLY: I think the proper
procedure for the right honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) would be to
move that the report be referred hack ta the
committee with instructions ta do certain
things.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the
honourable mernber's suggestion is weli
foundcd.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Honourable mcmbers, whcn a bill is reported by a comrnittee
with an amendment, the procedure requires
a vote first on the amendment. If the amendment is concurred in, then the second question is: Shall the Bill, as amended, be adopted?
I think that should be the procedure here.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is the suggestion of the honourable senator from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) eoncurred in?
Or does the honourable gentleman from Westmoriand (Hon. Mr. Black) wish leave of the
House to withdr-aw%his motion for immediate
consideration of the report, and ta have it
stand until the next sitting?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, honourable members, that is not my intention. Unless someanc desires ta make that motion, I think we
had better vote on the amendmeot made by
the committee ta the Bili. If that is adopted,
the next question would be: Shall the Bill,
as amended, be adopted?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion,
honourable senators, is that the amendment
as proposed by the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce be concurred in. Io
it your pleasure, honourabie senators, ta adopt
the motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS:. No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Black was negatived: contents, 22; non-contenta, 29.

The Hon. the -SPEAKER: When shall this

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourabie senators, I give notice of an inquiry of the Governmcnt:What is the German population of Canada,.
by provinces, for the years 1921, 1931 and 1939?'
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: I arn not iii
the Govcrnmcnt, but if I were I should not
know what the question meant. What ia
meant by "German population"?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn asking whaft
the German pnpulation, by provinces, was irv
1921, 1931 and 1939. If my right honourablefriend does not know what the termi "German'
population" means, hie need flot worry, because
the Dominion Statistician know.s it and will
answer in accordance with regulations whieh
lie bas laid down, I take it, for segregation
of various nationalities.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: For the information of
those who do not know, may I ask, does the
terni mean residents in Canada who were bora
in Germany, or doca it mean residents in
Canada of German descent?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 arn only asicing for figures on the German population
of Canada. The method of taking the census
determines that question. The census takers
follow racial origins back so many generations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That may be,
but they do not use the t.erra "German population."

DEFENCE PURCHASES, PROFITS CONTROL, AND FINANCING BILL
SECOND READING

lion. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 38, an Act to establish
a Defence Purchasing Board to control the
awarding of contracts for the manufacture of
defence equipment and the construction of
defence projects, to limit costs and control
profits in respect -of such contracts, and to
authorize the raising by way of boans of certain sums of money for such purposes.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this measure

-bas quite a long titie, but it may be cited

as the Defence Purchases, Profits Control, and
Financing Act, 1939. It will meet the views
,of most of those people throughout the world
who have constantly been protesting against
the idea that men should enrich themselves
by the manufacture of war materials when their
compatriots were giving their lives on the
battlefield for the defence of their country.
-if is feit that profits made in that way in time
oüf war are grossly unjust and immoral, and
ilL many countries there bias been an insistent
demand that wealth bc conscripted as well as
men. This sentiment lias been extended by
many people to include munitions profits made
in times of peace, and a considerable body of
public opinion supports the prohibition of
private manufacture of munitions. The present
Bill does flot go so far as thiat, but it seeks
to, impose considerable limitation on the profits
of munition and armament contractors.
Ini 1915 Great Britain passcd the Munitions
of War Act with a view te limiting profits
in establishments producing munitions. in 1937
Mr. Chamberlain introduced bis measure providing for national defence contribution levies,
a general tax on profits. The United States
likewise have adopted legislation limiting
profits on some armament contracîs and taxing
excess profits. In 1934 that country passed
the so-called Vinson Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIFSBACH:
are profits limited?

To whiat amoont

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I tbink the data
I have before me will cover tliat. If it does
not, I shaîl come back to the question.
As one of Canada's war-time measures, a
War Purchasing Commission of three mcmbers was organized by an Order ini Council
of May 8, 1915. This Commission was given
the power generally to make ahl contracts for
the purchase of materials of war and supplies
of every kind, and for transportation payable
under the War Appropriation Act of 1915.
The largest part of the work of the Commission concerned the purchase of supplies for
the Canadian Expeditionary Force.
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH.

The Order in Council sets forth certain provisions relating to the constitution of the
Board, and the rules governing its procedure.
For example, no contract could be made by
the Commission except under a requisition
made iipon it by the department concerned.
It migbt be noted, however, in contrast to the
present proposed Bill, that the War Purchasing- Commission did flot require the approval
of the Governor in Council of proposed contracts. alhough the Council authorized the
release of funds and certain specific purchases.
That is te, say, so long as the War Appropriation Act gave authority for a certain
expenditure, thon, upon requisition by the
department concerned, the Commission had
the power to proceed forthwith to enter
a contract. The Commission wvas instructed
tuit as far as practicable tenders sbouhd be
obtained and contracts given at the howest
price offered.
An Order in Counicil issued February 6,
1918, extended the functions of the War PurClbasing Commission to cover the supervision
of aIl purchiases made by aIl (lepartmnents of
Goveromnent. and not merely purchases under
War Appropriation Acts. The Board did
not itself actually do the biiying for al
departoients. but it cxercised supers isory

In 1916 an exccss profits tax was introduced. Profits werc to ho cahculated on the
basis of paid-up capital stock. The measure
lex icd a tax of 25 per cent on profits of corporat ions in ùxcess of 7 per cent, and on the
profits of individuals in excess of 10 per cent.
In 1917 an amneodment stiffencd the tax
rates and at the sinie time intridued the
principle of graduation. It provided for a
tax of .50 per cent on profits between 15 per
cent ani 20 per cent, and a tax of 75 per cent
on profits in excess of 20 per cent. In 1920

APRIL 19, 1939
The business profits war tax expired December 31, 1920.
We are ail aware that the volume of expenditure for defence purposes was a fairly
modest one during the years preceding 1936.
An average of $17,000,000 was the annual
budget of our National Defence Department
during the ten preceding years. During 193637 that expenditure increased to, approximateiy $23,000,000, and the Government
became concerned about the procedure to be
foiiowed for the control of undue profits in
connection with peacetime contracts under
any defence programme that might be
authorized. The first step taken was the
appointment of a committee known by the
namne of its chairman, the Skelton Committee.
In January, 1937, that committee reported
that "the problemn appears to be essentially
an administrative one," and recommended a
standing Interdepartmental Financial Committee to assist the officiais charged with the
placing of contracts under the defence programme.
The Prime Minister on April 2, 1937, informed the Commons of the establishment of
an Interdepartmentai Committee such as had
been recommended, and, at the same time,
outiined Government policy for the control
of profits with respect to armament expenditure. The statement made by the Prime
Minister at that time is as foilows:
For some months past an Interdepartmental
Committee bas been going very carefuliy into
the whole question of the control of profits
with respect to munitions of war. That coinînittee has been workine in conlunction with
members of the Goverument. The line upon
whieh we have been proceeding is to attempt to
draw a distinction between war materials produced iu times of peace and what may be

necessary in times of war. Unquestionably
special legisiation would be required in turnes

l

a logical move to make in order to secure
the most economical expenditure of the funds
appropriated by Parliament.
The Bill consists of two parts. Part I pro-

vides for the establishment of the Defence
Purchasing Board and sets forth its dutiea

and the relations between the Board and the
Departinent of National Defence, the Min-

ister of Finance and the Governor in CouneilProcedures are laid down, designed to lixnit
cost to the Government and to, safeguarî
against undue or unreasonable profits to any

contractor or sub-contractor. Furthermore,
Part I contains the very important provisions

defence equipment contracta to the maximuum of 5 per cent on the capital employed in
carrying out the contract. This principle la

given effect to through the device of taxing
away profits in excess of the maximum 5 pev;
cent aiiowed.. Part II of the Bill provides
the authority for borrowing to meet that;
part of defence expenditures whîch, as indicated in the estimates, la to be charged to
capital account.
The Defence Purchasing Board is to consist of four members, a chairinan and three
other members. appoînted for a termi of five
years. The chairman will be the chief executive officer, receîving a salary, and will devote
bis whole time to the Board. The remaining
three members will not be on salary, butý
wvill be reimbursed in respect of actual expenses and will receive a per diem allowance

SENATE
After having received a requisition in
respect of defence equipment or a project, the
Board will proceed with its business of preparing to fill the order. In proceeding te fill
the order the Board is explicitly instructed by
this Bill with regard to the policy to be followed.
The principle is laid down that,
wherever practicable, tenders must be invited,
either by means of advertisements in the
public press or otberwise. Furtbcrmore. the
-Bill declares that the Board must accept the
Ilowest tender submitted unless it is satisfied
that it would not be in the public interest to
do so. It is obviously possible that in certain
rases there may be good reasons why the lowest tender should not be acccpted. For example, the Board may be of the opinion that
,the person submitting the lowest tender is
not capable of carrying out the contract. In
such a case, however, the Bill provides that
where the lowest tender is not accepted the
Board shall make a deta,iled report to the
Minister of Finance setting forth the reasons
why the lowest tender was not recommended.
The Minister of Finance in turn must pass
on to the Governor in Council this report,
together with bis own recommendations regarding it.

In cases where the Board, after carefully
exploring the possibilities. cornes to flie decision that it is impracticable to invite tenders,
then two further duties arc imposed upon the
Board. In the finst place the Board must provide in non-competitive contracts such safeguards that a fair and reasonable eost to the
Government will be assured. and no unfair or
unreasonable profit will be made by the conIn the second place the Board must
tracter.
in each case of a non-competitive contract being
recommended make a report to the M-inister of
Finance stating clcarly the reasons which have
led the Board to decide that it was impracticable to invite tenders. Again the Minister
of Finance must submit this report to the
Governor in Council, together with his own
recommendations concerning it.
Procedure to be followed by the Board is
still further defined in the Bill. This further
duty imposed on the Board by the terms of
the Bill relates to the circumstances where the
Board recommends the purchase of any defence
equipment outside of Canada. The Government were eoncerned lest the Board, in its
attempt to fill the orders for defence equipment at the lowest dollar cost possible to the
Government, might net be sufficiently concerned with the broader considerations of
Government policy generally. The Government are determined to ensure that, unless
the vrticles in question cannot be purchased
in O riada or else cannot be secured except on

terms.
Canadian

the benefit of every dollar of defence expenditure. Accordingly, in cases where the Board
recommends the purchase of any defence equipment outside of Canada the Board must make
a report to the Minister of Finance stating
clearly the reasons why it does not recommend
Chat the order be placed in Canada. The
Minister of Finance must subrmit the report
wit:h his own recommendations to the Governor in Council.
Upon the approval by the Governor in
Council of any proposed contract it will be
the duty of the Board to enter upon such
contract as agent for the Dominion Government.
The duties of the Board do net end, however, with the mere negotiating and letting
of contracts. Its duties will extend to cover
subsequent supervision of the performance of
such contracts; which I think the House will
agree is a very important aspect of the functions of such a Board. Other auxiliary powers
of the Board relate to matters which are
likewise of vital importance in a broad defence programme for Canada. For example,
the Board is to be given power to explore
the general field of the requiremcents of the
Depairtmiient of National Defence, present or
anticipated, for equipment, materials, supplies, et cetera, and may in co-operation with
the Minister of National Defence survey
generally facilities of existing industrial plants
in Canada to determine Canada's potential
It
ability to provide defence equipment.
is also the duty of the Board to prepare and
keep up-to-date complete lists of sources of
supply for defence equipment.
In order to enable the Board to carry out
the extremely important duties which the
Government are placing upon it, the Board is
given power to employ such expert technical
and professional officers as are necessary, with
the approval, however, of the Governor in
Council, but it is expected that the normal
staff requirements of the Board will be taken
care of by transfers from Government departments or by Civil Service appointments.
I bave stated already the Government's
intention to sec that no person in Canada
shall profit unfairly through Canada's need
for defence. In addition to all the other
safeguards already indicated, this Bill includes
a provision for the definitive limitation of
profits to 5 per cent per year on the average
capital enployed in the performance of the
non-competitive contract. This will be given
effect to through the levying of a tax of 100
per cent on profits in excess of 5 per cent on
non-competitive contracts entered into by the

APRIL 19, 1939
Board. This provision shahl not apply, however, in the case of contracts awarded as a
rcsult of competitive tendering, since in such
circumstanca it may safely be assumed that
unreasonable profits will not be obtained by

the contractor.
limniting profits should leava no doubt in the
mind of anyone as to the Goverument's determination to protect the publie against any
who might seak to take advantage of our
country's urgent necd for defance. This provision is a drastie one. It goas beyond anything I know of in the legislation of any
other country. It definitely aliminates any
clament of profiteering. It may indeed go
s0 far as to make it difficult to carry out our
programme. The Government, however, hahaeva that it will be able to count on the
co-oparation of Canadian manufacturars in
the essential task of providing for the effective
defence of Canada.
Part II of the Bill naeds.littla elaboration
here. It mcrcly provides the Government
with authority to borrow such money as may
ba raquired to provide for expendituras which
in the annual estimatas of the Department of
National Defanca are indicatad as chargeable
to capital account. The amount so charged
to capital account. amounting to just over
$29,00O,0OO this yaar, together with interest
thereon at 3 par cent, is to ba subsaquantly
paid off or amortized over a period of tan
yaars by an annual sinkîng fund, which will
ha provided for in the ordinary appropriations of the Dcpartmant of National Defence.
I should like hara to explain to the House
the reason for adopting the practice which
I have just outlined of charging a portion
of defance cost to, capital account and amortizing it ovar a pariod of years. It is a
practica that I frankly admit constitutas a
departure fromn the mathod of treating expanditure which we have been folhowing since
this Goverument cama into power, but it is
justifiêd on three grounds. First, we are finding it suddenly nacessary to make vary large
axpandituras on defance in order to make up
for the shortages of a period in which the
De-fence Services ware liteally "starved." In
a world in which ahl countries ara finding it
urgantly iiccessary to arma on a large scale,
we find a grave shortage in ail our major
items of defance equipmant and preparation.
WTýlehave been carrying on on a "hand te
mouth" basis; we must nbw stock up, build
up our rasarvas for the future, in case an
emargency arises. In the second place, ail the
items which are treatcd in this way ara of a
nature which can ha lagitimately "capitalized,"
and most of thcma ara of a durable nature,
with a fairly long period of useful lifebarring a war. For instance, no ona would,

167

I think, question that payment for expanditures on coast fortifications, airdromes, naval
vessels, beavy armaments and the like might
reasonably be spread over a fairly long period.
The example of Great Britain should be noted.
Finally, the justification for treating these
expenditures differently from other so-called
capital expenditures is that we are providing
in the ordinary appropriations each year a
sinking fund which will amortize therm fully
over a ten-year period. Few will deny that
if we had a general sinking fund to retire
our national debt, there would be justification
for capitalizing a considerable amount of expanditure on public works, buildings, et cetera,
wbich we are now including in our over-ali
deficit.
With this perhaps too, long explanation,
I now move the second reading of the Bill,
seconded by the Right Hgn. Mr. Graham.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
gentlemen, the atmosphere in which we discuss this Bill is this: aither we are on the
verge of a world war, which may break out
any day, or, failing the outbreak of war, it is
clear that for many years to corne international relations will be basad upon armed
strength. Apart from appropriation bis, this
is the first Bill that bas corne to us which bas
to do with organization. An opportunity therefore presents itself, by way of proper amandments to this Bill, to lay a foundation for the
systemn under which our rearmament projects
may be carried forward in such a way as to,
first, spaed up the whola business of rearmament; second, provide for the laying down
of principles which, in broad outline, are to
govern; and third, gain and maintain the
confidence of the people in this'expenditura
while retaining parliamentary -control by
accepted methods of constitutional government, to the end that efficiency and economy
may be promoted.
Parhaps I may say here that I deteet in
my contacts with soldiers throughout Canada
a distinct degrea of apprehension, if not dissatisfaction, with regard to the progress being
made in rearmament. Thesa men cannot sea
that any change whataver bas taken place in
our land forces in the mattar of armament,
equipmant, strength or training since the
increasad appropriations of the past threa
years. There ara no armoured fighting vehicles,
anti-aircraft defenees or gas defances. There
is no increase in machine guns, light or haavy,
nor in artillery. Thare are no tractors for
artillery, which is stili horse-drawn. With
hors&-drawn artillery your radius of action fer
the day is twenty miles; with tractor-drawn
artillery it is twenty miles an hour, multiplied
by the number of hours in which you eau

168

SENATE

move. The difference between the two is so
striking as to leave those with the horsedrawn artillery wholly at the mercy of very
much smaller forces of tractor-drawn artillery.
In short, our military position is no better than
it bas been for the past ten years. Canadian
soldiers wonder what the Government are
doing. I wonder myself. Meanwhile they
hear of political interference and backstair
methods, of a certain timidity and a distinct
disinclination on the part of the Government
to grapple with the outstanding problem, which
is to establish in Canada an armament industry and get on with the job of putting Canada
into a state of defence based upon her own
industry and resources. They complain that
during this period there has been no increase
in the strength of our armed forces, no lengthening of the period of training and no attempt
to grapple with the-problems which confront
our land forces in the matter of recruitment,
clothing, equipment, mobilization plans and
the like.
Now I propose to separate the two main
portions of the Bill. In adopting this Bill
it is very necessary that we should understand precisely what we are doing. The
honourable leader of the Government, in his
explanation, indicated on the one hand the
urgency of rearmament, and on the other
the need of preventing excess profits. There
is the problem which confronts us and which
must be met; and we must meet it by determining which objective is to have prioritywhether we shall a.pply ourselves to preventing profits, or whether rearmament shall be
the main purpose. I submit, in the light of
what I said a moment ago as to either the
imminence of war, on the one hand, or on the
other the faet that international relations in
future will be conducted on the basis of
armed strength, that the question of the rearmament of Canada should be the prime
preoccupation of the Government. And if,
even at this late date, we can lay down a
proper foundation upon which to proceed,
we shall have accomplished a good day's
work. I submit this Bill offers us the opportunity.
The history of Canada in the making of
war is not one to be proud of, so far as
administration is concerned. Going back to
the Fenian Raids, we find that neglect by
preceding governments resulted in confusion,
waste and inefficiency, and a certain amount
of crookedness.
Following the history of
Canada's military efforts since that time, we
find much the same thing-inefficiency due
to neglect, ignorance and stupidity; an inefficiency which bas cost us vast sums of
money. And there is always .present the possiHon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

bility of fraud, the intervention of the crooks,
who are always with us. I fancy that at this
very moment, throughout Canada, these individuals are figuring with pencil and paper
how they can come into the picture and walk
off with a substantial profit. We have with
us all the time the individual who is prepared
to sell in time of war faulty equipment, worthless clothing., poor food and the like; and
the avenue of approach of these individuals
is always some shady politician, either in
Parliament or outside. I can think of no
meaner or more despicable crime than that
of the individual who sells inefficient equipment for the use of the country's soldiers in
time of war, and, just as I find it impossible
to describe the crime, parliamentary practice
prevents me from presenting the manner in
which such people should bc punished. But
as sure as can be, unless we lay down as
soon as possible a sound system for the
expenditure of public money, we shall be
confronted at the end of this period with the
same degree of inefficiency and the same
attempts at fraud and rascality with respect to
the supply of military material as in the past.
Now, what I should hope to do with this
Bill would be to integrate it as far as possible
with the system now prevailing in this country and throughout the British Commonwealth.
But first it is necessary to discuss the form
of organization in force in Canada to-day.
We have in this country what is known as
We got it from
the general staff system.
Great Britain. Great Britain got it originally
from the Germans after the Franco-German
war. At that time all military students were
trying to find out how the German success
in that war had come about. The same
question was being studied by other great
powers. In an examination of the German
system of control of the military forces by
the general staff, it was at once discovered
that this system would not be applicable to
Great Britain, for the reason that under
Parliament
form
of
governmient
our
lias complete control of the affairs of
the country. In Germany at that time, and
until the end of the Great War, the general
staff was responsible only to the Kaiser. The
system of the German general staff had to
be broken down to suit our form of government.
Therefore in England there was
evolved the method of placing a Minister of
War in charge of military affairs, and having
under him a number of secretaries, and
thereby providing for entire control of the
army by Parliament through a member of the
Cabinet. Prior to the Great War we adopted
that system. I almost hesitate to say what

APRIL 19, 1939
happened to it during the War, but I intend
ta raise the question in a few days, when I
may discuss it. It is sufficient to say that
the general staff systema was shot to pieces
and virtualiy ceased ta exist except on sufferance of one individuai. But after the Great
War the general staff systemi was re-estabiished in Canada as it exjsts in Great Britain.
I wiii read the Order in Council which provides for that formn of contrai. There are
four military officers here in Ottawa, who
have divided among themn ail the power, authority and functions necessary ta contrai aur
armed forces. These officers are: the Chief
of the Generai Staff, the Quartermaster-Genera], the Adjutant General and the Master
Generai of the Ordnance. I wiii flot detain
the House by reading the duties of these
officers, but wiil simpiy say that the Chief of
the Generai Staff is the head of the group.
That is, hie is merely first among equais. That
is an important principle ta be observed,
because hie bas no right ta override other
members of the headquarters staff. Each of
these officcrs is flot oniy entitied, but required by practice, ta stand forward and give
his views with respect ta his particular branel.
But I want ta read the duties of the Master
Generai of the Ordnance, because this Bill
places nesriy ail these duties upon the chairman of this Purcha 'sing Board whicb, is ta be
appointed. As I said a moment ago, my
proposai wiIl be ta integrate this measure
with the system that now prevajis. The
duties of the Master General of the Ordnance,
as set out in the Order in Council, which is
Appendix VI of the King's Regulations and
Orders for the Canadian Militia, are as
foilows:

Director of Contracte, inspection, and aiiotment

As I said a moment ago, the four officers
whom I mentioned divide smong them ail the
power and responsibility necessary for coinpiete contrai of aur military forces. Thle
aext step, f ollowing again the precedent set
in Great Britain, is the establishment of what
is calied over there the Army Council, or
what we in Canada cali the Defence Couacil,
for the purpose of advisiag the Minister. Our,
Defence Council consists of the Minister of
National Defence as chairman, the Deputy
Minister as vice.-chairmsn, the Chief of the
General Staff, the Quartermaster-Generai, the
Adjutant Generai, the Master General of the
Ordace, the Judge Advocate-General, the
head of the Navy, and the head of the Air
forces. They are the responsihie and coinpetent advisers of the Minister. Ia the iiterature on the subject they are constantiy
referred ta as such.
I draw the attention of honourabie members ta the fact that the Mînister and Deputy
Minister are mentioned as the first and second
members of the Defence Council and are described as civilian mem-bers, dischargiag purely
civilin fuactions. I draw particular attention ta this because I feel that before we
emerge from aur present difficuities we shahl
probably find there bas been, or may be, or
is iikeiy ta he, interference an the part of
these purely civilia members of the Defence
Council with the military members. The
literature on the suhject discusses at great
iength distribution of duties between the
civilia sud the military members, draws the
uine of demarcation beyond which, members
in these respective classes ought not ta go,
and points out how they may work together
for the best resuIts by confining their activities
within the spheres proper ta the positions
which they hld.
The Pefeace Council in Canada bas not
been by any means as active as it should
have been, and I think we should insist that
it become active again. It sbould keep proper
minutes and records, and we slould compel
aur senior officers ta corne forward and take
a proper stand in the administration of their
branches and in the offering of advice. Under
perfectiy normal conditions, such as existed,
say, three years ago, this Defence Council
would have advised the Minister, or should
have advised him, in aIl matters pertaining ta
contrai of aur defence forces. Inciuded, in
those wouid have been the acquisition of any
necessary materials, such as guns, clothing
and the like, which are envisaged in this Bill.
The procedure is that the Minister, after being
advised by the Defence Council, preseats his
estimates. The Defence Cauncii has ail the
machinery necessary for acquisition of

materials and equipment in times of peace.
Formerly most of the acquisitions of military
equipment came from Great Britain; it was
necessary merely to send a cablegrami and
have the order put through. But to-day the
situation is very different. Great Britain has
no equipment, te seli te us, for it is busily
engaged in equipping itself. Consequently,
whatever equipment we need, whether it be
guns of any calibre or description, vehicles or
arms of any type at aIl, will have te ho
obtained
in Canada,
through our own
resources, from our ewn secondary industries.
,My honourable .friend the leader of the
Gevernment (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) madle
some comments on the armament industry
and referred to attacks that have ibeen made
upon it. An armament industry exists in any
country just, as any other industry does, that
is by selling what it produces te people who
will buy.
It may se happen that, in a
sibsequent war, material produced in, say,
Great Britain, will be used against that
country. That possibility bas provided persons
who attack the armament industry with very
valuable ammunitien. They ring the changes
on it. They tell how the Dardanelles were
defended hy British guns wvhich had 'been put
into place .by British engineers some thirty or
forty ycars before. And every now and then
we hear it said that by experting nickel frem
this country now 'we are making it possible
for Canadian soldiers te be killed in a distant
country some years hence by munitions macde
from this very nickel. So there is a demand
for an embargo on the export. But if we
prevented the export of nickel and were
consistent, we should have to place an embargo
upon the expert of wheat and practically
everything else we preduce. In other words,
we should have virtually te put an end te
international trade and commerce, in order te
make sure that what we preduce shaîl net
somte day be used against us.
Ie the eyes of some people. the armarnent
industry bas long heen under a cleud. The
royal commission which investigated the
armameet iedustry in Creat Britain found
many interesting things, some of which have
heen referred te in this Chamber in past
sessions. One thing they pointed eut was
that an armament industry in any couetry
made a pe.werful contribution te national
defence. I take my stand squarely upon this
greund, that we can oely rearmn through our
ewn production, our ewn resources and our
ewn iedustry, and I state further that we
shaîl only do that successfully and more or
less economically hy the creatien of an
armament industry.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

We have ne armament industry, and the
task of fieding mil.itary material in Canada
was beyond the experience, and I think pre.bably Jheyond the cempetence, of the Defeece
Council. It was toc, ibig a job altegether for
them. Coesequeetly, I arn fully in faveur of
the principal object of this Bill, which is the
appointment of a cemmittee or board te
undertake military purchases. What it finally
amounts te is the creatien in Canada of an
armament industry. That involves consideratiens of finance, Gov'ernmeet pelîcy and
internal and external conditions, and these
thinga are 'heyend the capacity of the Defence
Ceuncil te deal with. Se 1 approve of a
Defence Purchasing Board as provided for in
this measure.
It seems te me that what we urgently need
in this ceuntry at present is that our people
shaîl have confidence in the Government aed
in t.he whole rearmament preject. If every
contract that is let is te, be assailaible and
assailed on the ground that there is some
rascality in ceneection with it, or that it is
unwise or inefficient, er that it is likely te
produce a pelitical scandaI, we shahl neyer get
anyrwhere. We must evelve seme kind of
systemn which will work and will inspire
confidence in the people in this great project
of rearming. I doubt the capacity of this
Chamhber--'wýell, perhiaps net se much of this
Chamber. but certainly I deuht the capacity
ef the other Heuse te cenduct an intelligent
inquiry into matters of this kind. The visit
of some 45 memrbers of that House to the
Bren gun factery at Toroeto was a piece of
political horse-play.
Net ene of them was
capable of expressing an epinien as te the
capacity ef the factery. Indeed, if they had

I am simply

within the precinets of this Chamber.
,Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Thank you. I
am glad of the warning. and 1 will net offend
again. se long as whaýt I did say is fully understeed and taken in.
Ever since I have heen a member of this
bouse I have heen peinting eut twe or three
facts. Thcy have been tlue burden of ýmy song

APRIL 19, 1939
I have tried to get honourable members to se
thiat if y-ou improvise an army in the face of
a panlic you will have to pay from two to
three or four times the real value of the
equipment you buy, and you will have two
or three times the casualties which you would
have had otherwise, because of the lack of
trained offleers, principally, and of other
tnained ranks as well. So I face the position
that the paying of high prices for munitions
cannot be avn,(ided.
The Czechoislovakian
Gov'ernment probably got the Bren gun from
the Skoda works for about $100. That is
approximately the value of the gun as a piece
of fabricated steel. The lowest estimate that
I have been able to flnd of the cost of the
Bren gun in Canada is $525, but the Winnipeg Free Press estimates, I tbink, that the
cost of every Bren gun will be $1.305. I am
prepared to be reconciled to 'that. because we
are rearmin.- and improvising in the face of
a crisis. Time is the elernent that governs.
Our job is to rearm, and that is a bigger
th-ing than the attemp-t to keep profits frcom
becoming unduiy high. We must get the
necessary equipment at the earliest possible
date, and in order that we may be successful
xi this the Governmcnt must have the confidence of the people. This Bill provideis one
of the means which I think we ought to have.
The Bill provides that the Defence Purchasing Board shahl discharge the functions
of the Master Generai of the Ordnance and
the Director of Contracts and part of the
functions of the Quartermaster-General. What
I arn suggcsting is that we shouid seize this
opportunity to integrate this measure with
the present system. I would urge that the
chairman of this Board be appoint-ed a member
of the Defence Council, and that the necessary changes incidentai to this end be made
in the Bill. I have aiready given the list of
members of the Defence Council, and pointed
out that they are the competent and responsible advisers of the Government. I suggest
te honourahie members that if, eay, three years
ago thère had been a Defence Purchasing
Board, the chairman of which was a member
of the Defence Council, as I arn now urging
he should be, then every step taken by the
Minister for the purchase of munitions would
have been upon the advice of tbis Board and
we should -have had no discussions such as
we have had witb respect to the Bren gun,
shahl contracts, mnunition box contracts, and sýo
on. I suggest that the Defence Council is the
only body in wbicb tihe chairman of the
Defence Purcbasing Board could function
properly. There be would be suirrounded by
competent and responsible advisers of the
Governmeýnt, and 'have access to technical
71498-12à

171

experts in ail branches of military activity.
The other memnbers of the Defence Council
would be kept in closest touch with him,
and in that way we should avoid one of tihe
great dangers of rearming, namely, wbat is
kn.own as lag in the production of eq&ipment,
on the one hand, and, on the other hand, in
the obtaining of trained meni to use that
equipment.

I wiil give an exampie of how the systena
would work, assuming the amexidment I propose is adopted and the chairman of the
Defence Purcbasing Board is made a member
of the Defence Couneil. Under our systemn
it is the business of one person in Canadà te
advise what we ought te have for military
purposes. That person is the Cbief of the
General Staff. It is the business of the Cbief
of the Generai Staff and of nobody else to
bring forward a proposal that we shouid nequire, say, 100 anti-.aircraft, guns, witb the
necessary auxiliary equipment. As the senior
member of the Defence Council and the top
soldier of Canada, it is lis responsibility to
say wbat we need. He cornes to the Defence
Cou-ncil with that proposai. It is considered
by tbe Council, and it is agreed to as to
quantity, quality, mark, type, and the like.
The Minister goes to the Cabinet with that
recommendation and bas it approved, and
then he turns the order over to, the chairman
of the committee we are about to create.
This committee is to consist of a chairman.
and three otber members. I do not know
whetber those three will serve a-ny useful
purpose. It would please me just as well if
tbey were not provided for.
The chairman of the Purchasing Board is
also a member of tbe Defence Council, and
lie proceeds to acquire tbe guns. As they
cannot be purcbased in Canada, he bas to,
evolve a poiicy to get them. H1e wili prob-,
abiy bave to pay tbree or four times wbat
the guns are worth. But that is not the
point at the moment. If the guns are urgently
necessary he must induce somebody te make
tbem, and must lay down the terms and
conditions for their production. In doing
that he will he advised by the responsible and'
competent maxi who sit around bim and are
technicai experts. Ail these bead officers
have their tecbnical staffs behind tbem. And
so from day to day be carnies out bis work
lin that atmospbere, surrounded by these men.
But that is not tbe wholly important point.
Sitting witb him, for instance, is tbe AdjutantGeneral. It is the duty of the AdjutantGeneral to organize the forces and train them,
and if he bas to man a bundred guns, then ha>
must get the best part of twelve bundred men

172

SENATE

trained to handle those guns when they arrive.
So he sets about the organization of the
necessary troops for that purpose.
At the same time the QuartermasterGeneral learns of this movement. He is the
officer whose duty it is to feed, clothe, house
and transport these troops when they are
raised.
It will be seen that each military member
of the Defence Council has a job to attend to.
This is what has to be done. Approximately
on the day the guns are ready for delivery
the Adjutant-General has to produce his
twelve
hundred trained
men, and the
Quartermaster-General has to feed and clothe
them and move them to the point to which
they are assigned.
Now, if these guns be on hand at the
precise day when the troops are ready to
take them over, and the barrack accommodation is ready, and so on, you have avoided
what is called "lag."
Let me say that in
rnilitary enterprises lag is the most costly and
disturbing factor that can be introduced.
I give this as one example of how the
Board would work, and how its chairman would
find' himself surrounded by these technical
men, so that the whole thing would move
forward together with the minimum friction
.nd expense.
I submit that if the Minister is, from week
to week, advised by the Defence Council,
with the chairman of the Purchasing Board
sitting in, and that fact is made publie and
everybody knows the Minister is so advised,
his position will be immensely strengthened
in the public mind. At the moment nobody
knows who advises the Minister. A reading
of the Bren Gun Report leaves us still in
ýh ubt. In one paragraph we are told how the
CMerdepartmental Committee had selected a
number of precision steel concerns in Canada
who could make the Bren gun. The Interdepartmental Committee proposed to bring
Ihem down to Ottawa and show them the
gun, with the plans and specifications, the
ygauges and the like, and induce all or some
f those firms to make an offer to manufacture it in Canada. I think they hoped to
get at least three or four of those concerns
to undertake its manufacture.
Had they
done so, we should have made a decided step
towards establishing that particular form of
munition industry in Canada. But on a
certain day the Deputy Minister informed
the committee that the Government had
decided to employ Major Hahn's concern.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think my
honourable friend is in error, and because I
think so I would draw his attention to the
fact that it would perhaps be as well for him,
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

in developing his theory, to leave aside a
muatter which is now under inquiry by the
Public Accounts Committee of the other
House.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not think
we can consider the matter as sub judice.
True, it is before the Public Accounts Committee of the other House, but that committee
is not getting very far with its inquiry. I
an trying to establish the fact that if such a
hody as I suggest had been in existence when
the proposal to manufacture the Bren gun
in this country was first made, we should not
be now engaged in this discussion and there
would be no occasion for the present work
of the Public Accounts Committee. Let me
complete that statement. At the bottom of
page 40 of the report on the Bren Machine
Gun Contract by Mr. Justice Davis, this is
what Mr. Elliott stated in his evidence:
Now the committee, after hearing this,That is, after hearing the Government had
made a decision.
-agreed that if the department is taking the
responsibility that this particular firm must
have the contract, and the War Office refused
to do business with any other firm than this
John Inglis Company, then the force and purpose of the committee expended in getting competitive bids necessarily must cease, and we
must face the situation of a contract to be
analysed in its particular terms, having regard
to the financial aspects and the ultimate profit
to the contractor.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As my honourable friend sees, that is a statement of fact
coming from the British Government.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, no. I am
quoting from Mr. Justice Davis's report where
he cites the evidence given by Mr. Elliott.
But the whole of these two pages of the
report shows that the Interdepartmental Committee had a plan ready. They said the
proper firms to make the Bren gun in Canada
were those engaged in the manufacture of
precision steel, and so they made a list of
tlose firms, including the Steel Company of
Canada, the Dominion Bridge Company, the
Dominion Car and Foundry Company, the
Bertram Company, the National Steel Company. and some others. The committee's proposal was to sec what those firms could do.
The important point is that the Government
decided-there can be no denial of this-to
deal with Hahn.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend is in error.

No; my honour-

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then the Minister
did.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

It is an error.
Who did?

APRIL 19, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The British
Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: How couid
the British Government decide that we should
deai with Hahn?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honourabie friend to the fact
that the British Government wouid not consent to have competitive bids. For various
reasons. which I have before me, they decided
to deai with one single individuai.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I cannot accept
the honourable gentlemen's view, having read
the report with some care. The British Government would neyer have heard of the John
Inglis Company or of Major Hahn if it had
flot been for the intervention of our Government.
flon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was at their
reqiest.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: At this moment
nobody in this country knows why the Geverament of Canada selected Major Hahn, nor
upon whose advice the Government or any
member of it acted. I am making my present
proposai because 1 want to see the people of
this country have confidence in this Government as long as it iasts, or in any other
Goverament that is charged with responsihiiity
for rearming Canada. That is essential. It
is not a political question. It is ahsoiuteiy
necessary that we have a system which will
work and in which the people of this country
shall have confidence. We must have our
equipment at as reasonahie a price as we can
get it, and of a quaiity suitahie to our needs.
It wouid be fatal to permit a condition of
affairs te continue whereby there wouid be
a political discussion or scandai in respect
of every contract to be made. I want to
avoid that. I say that if this system which I
suggest had been in vogue two years ago, and
the public knew that the Minister's advice to
the Goverament on technical matters was
based on the advice of these technical experts,
his position would be infinitely stronger than it
is to-day. That is the position in which I propose te have him piaced by the amendments I
shail offer to this Bull when we get into coinmittee.
In support of my argument I desire to refer
to The Army, a book written by Brigadier
Dewing, of the British Army, and published
in 1938. It is written for the purpose of
bringing up to date information of what is
being done in the British Army.
I quote
from page 19:
Some major changes within the War Office
have arisen fromn the great expansion of wnrk
in directing, co-ordinating and speeding up the
supply of material for re-equipment.

173

That is our position exactly.
In 1936 the new post of Director-General of'
Munitions Production, wîth a seat on the Army

Council was created te carry eut those duties

which had previously rested entirely on the-

Master General of Ordnance.
That aise is exactly our position. This Bile
provides for the appointment of a gentlemn
te be known as the chairman of this Purchasing Board. In Great Britain the officer
filling a similar position is cailed DirectorGeneral of Munitions Production. He bas
been given a seat on the Army Council, which
corresponds te our Defence Council, aind,
because hie is doing the work of the MasterGeneral of Ordnance, that office was aboiished.
It will be seen that what I am advocating à2:
preciseiy what hm. been donc in Great Britaüy.
Such will he one of the important amendments
I shahl offer as soon as I have an opportunity
of seeing how it-can be incorporated in the
Bill.
When the time cornes 1 shahl move another
amendment te bring ail existing contracte let
by the Department of National Defence fer
rearmameat under the control and supervision
of this chairman of the Purchasing Board. We
cannot alter the terms of these contracte, but
if the man to be appointed te the position is
what hie ought te be, lie shouid be given sueh
authority.
Coming now te the question of the control
of profits, we are ail familiar with the approacli
te that aspect of rearmament. There bas been
a sustained attack on the armament industry,
and of course any man in this country who is
industrieus or enterprising or makes money
is generally attacked. In England, when 1
was there, I notîced a somewhat curions
mentality in this regard. They like a rich
man because, in the first place, lie spends;
money, and, in the second place, they tax the
life out of him. But in this country we
neyer let him get a start if we can heip it.
Consequently in another place it was popular
te attack the armament industry and everybody connected with it, te restrain what was
cailed' profiteering, and then te reduce the
rate of profit. My view is that you can
hardly get anyone te do anything in war
time unless you pay him. The onhy persont
whe works for next te nothing is the soidier;
everybody else has te be paîd. You cannot
get any industry started in Canada unless it
can he carried on at a profit. i fear the
clauses which have te do with the control of
profit. The limitation of 5 per cent arises
oniy in respect of non-cempetitive contracta,
but I apprehend there wihl be some skullduggery, because if a man knows lie is the
only one who can produce some thing, lie
wiil probably arrange te have competitors
bob up te justify a competitive contract, and

174

SENATE

then hoe will be unirestrained. That is the
sirnpiest thing in the world to bring about.
As to 5 per cent on the capital involved,
goodness knows what a chartered accountant
can do with a balance sheet. I think that
section of the Bill will require strict exarnination at the hands of our committee.
When speaking of the United States, my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) did
flot mention what had beon done there. As
a mattor of fact the United States Senate
decided that 15 per cent a year was n reasonable profit on the manufacture of airpianes.
I suppose we have ail received fromn the airplane industry of Canada a brief, which prosurnabiy most honourabie members have read.
Now, to restrict, profits te 5 per cent, without any means of knowing whether the con4ractors will accept the contract, is a dangerous step in view of the fact that speed in
rearmamont is essentiai. What confronts us
is the urgency of roarmamoent, as set eut by
the honeurable leader of the Gevernment, and
the preventien ef excess profits. Those are
two elements that appear te ho striving withi
each othor. In my viow the question te be
given prierity is that of rearmament. I iay
that down as an incontrovertible proposition.
Rearmamcn, must have priority. The prevontien of exoess profits we can look aftor by
taxation, and the honourablo gentleman has
outiined how it can ho donc. I submit this
Huse nmust meet that question fairiy and
;squarely. In another Houso-if I rnay ho permitted te refer to it-thoso whio supportod
this mneasure were principally those who had
nover advocated rearmamoot at ail, wero in
iact opposod te it, and whese economie
philosophy is that thore should he Government manufacture of overything.
I do net faveur Government manufacture,
hecause it is nover efficient, and, if yen bnilt

when war was over yen wouid have te disband thic whole business or carry an idie
staff. The only safe course is the establishment of an armiament indnstry, subject te
such Gevernment intervention as is necessary
te start the industry going with shadow plants
and the like, as has been done in Engiand,
and te control profits and secure efficiency.
That is the Government's job. That will be
eur poiicy anyhow, notwithstanding ail this
het air. I say that without any disrespect

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It sounds well
aiong the back lots te talk about soaking the
rich, and the like, but it is only for politicai
consumption.
Houi. Mr. GRIESBACH.

While on my foot, I may as weil discuss
another mattor. I arn intensely interested in
having some systemn adopted, but before it
wili work we rnust have the confidence of the
people in what is being donc. Every once in
a whiio yen hear in another House that the
Minister has been askod a question with
respect to what is being done-"What are
yeu accomplishing?" The answer generaily is,
"It wouid net be in the public interest to
disclose wvhat is heing done."' Whether the
Mi\,iter fears that the other nations of the
world will becomoe aiarmed by a disclosure
of our- grewing strength, or whother there is
nerhing te, disclose at ail. I arn net preparcd
te say; but certainiy the people are entitled
te know what they oughit to know, thoughi
anr thing that touches the socurity of the
countr' should net ho disciosed. However,
I question whether the people xviii long continue te accept the statoment of the Minister
as te wvhether there should or shouid not, ho
disciosure. and I think the situation wouid
ho very much improved if there were a parliainentary coemmiittee on -National Dofence,
with power te cati responsible persens in order
to ascertain whiat is geing on, and te give the
country some hope that somneene xviii watch

To recapitulate, an oppertunity presenits
itseif for the integration of what is contained
in this Bill with the existing system. Why

have read soi-e of his speeches, and I suggest
that they need strengthening in that regard.
Ilight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would there
bo any others?
Right Hon. ARTHUR MBIGHEN: Honourable memfters, certainly ne very heavy
duty devolves on rne after the exposition of
the honourable senator frorn Edmonton (Hon.

APRIL 19, 1939
Mr. Griesbach). His long association with
matters miiitary qualifies him to, speak with
an. authority that it would lie liard to parallel
in this House or in any other.
The measure that is before us cornes at a
time and in an atmosphere unprecedented in
the history of this country, and under circumstances which we must keep definitely belore
us in dealing 'with the Bill. I hold to, the
view expressed by the honoursaile leader of
the Government, and by the honourable
senator from Edmonton, that, thougli we are
stili at peace, this is probably an occasion
when the exceptionally heavy duties and
responsiibil.ities devolving upon the ordinary
officiais of a department are greater than
should lie imposed on men of their experience
and teclinical knowledge, and that those duties
demand the services of a man or men of
exceptional business capacity and training.
This being the case, 1 take no exception at
alI to the main principle of the Bull, but I
think great good can lie done and great
savings can ibe made by the utilization of the
services of a man of the-type I have mentioned.
And I make this central observation, because
it is most in my mind: if the Government will
see to it that the riglit man is chosen-and
they can easily do this, for doubtless there are
dozens who would be riglit, and certainly there
are hall a dozen rwho would lie universally
recognized as right--I arn not particular about
the rest of the measure so long as no part of
it hampers that man and prevents hlm from
doing his work. He will not need to lie
supported liy a lot of regulations and limitations; 'but if you do not choose a man of
standing and training, ahl the limitations,
regulations and restraints the wit of Parliament can devise will neyer see this country
served.
I arn not saying this liecause I have any
particular person in mind, ,but I do take the
li.berty of suggesting that if the Governmnent
will do as well in the selection of this individual
as tbey did in the selection of the head of the
Unemployment Commission, there will lie a
general sense of security and comfort throughout this Dominion. Hie is the type of man
needed, and once you get sudh a man the
one great necessity will 'be to give him liberty
of action. To tie him down by these artificial
restraints would lie suicidai.
I do not dispute the popularity of this
measure, particularly the public appeal of
the section whidh limits profits. I weli remember the great harangue about profiteering that
rang out through this country during the
War. Ninety-nine per cent of it was utter
nonsense. But if you set out by a measure
of this kind to stop profiteering, what you

are really going to do is hamstring the country. Any business man analysing the five per
cent restraint clause can convince anybody,
except those who are bound to get votes,
that it will do nothing but harm. It will do
the Government no harm. politically, but if
they are serious in the matter of rearmament
and view the present worid situation as I do,
the first thing they will do will be to strike
out a clause of that kind. Why? Let me put
this to you, honourable senators: The Bill
passes, and we are under the necessity of
letting contracts running into scores of
millions, and bere we have a clause which.
says that nobody entering into a contract
may make more than five per cent out of it.
Everything above that five per cent is taken
from him, and hie has to pay income tax, and
ail the other taxes, to perhaps two or three
govemmients. Wouid any honourable member of this House invest money in a company
that was undertaking work under this Bill?
No. I ask any honourable member who
would to stand up and say so. The company
takes the wbole risk. It pays taxes out of
the five per cent. If it loses money instead
of making it, what then? The public assumption that it is necessary only to start operations in order to make profits is based on
ignorance. In the initial stages baîf the
companies wiil lose. Yet men are invited to
put in money under that restraint. No one
but a child would put in a nickel under those
circumstances. Ta any further argument needed
if we are to lie at war with a great nation,
say, within a week or a month? If there
is no danger, we do not need this Bill. The
Bihl assumes that we may lie at war; therefore the matter must lie argued on that
assumption.
In this Bill we are seriously setting about
shackling the hands and feet of every Government that seeks to conduct us through
a war. Under it we could not move to the
riglit or the left; we could not move forward
the length of our arm. Some may think it
proper to impose such restrictions, but is it
done in any other land on earth? The
honourable leader of the Government spoke
of some measure adopted in Engiand. I
have not read it, nor have I investigated
it, but I wiil stake everything on the assertion
that it lias no resemblance to the five per cent
clause in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I admit that
this Bill is more stringent.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not of
the saine character at ahl. The United States,
I know, have a limit of twelve, thirteeen or
fifteen per cent-something like that; but I

176

SENATE

venture to say that if trouble comes a little
nearer their door than it is to-day, and they
find themselves on the verge of an emergency,
that limitation will not last long. There are
good business men in the States, but they
have not had as much experience of troubles
of this kind as bas been gained overseas.
When they did have such an experience their
business administration was not of the best.
They were in the Great War for a year and
a half, and when it was all over they did not
have very much in the way of war requirements. They had splendid soldiers, but nobody could boast of the excellence of their
business administration in providing the
requirements of war. They have some restraint, but with it they have far greater
liberty of action than is suggested here; and
there is not another free country which has
anything like the limitations that are here
sought to be imposed. All I say is that if
you attempt to put this Bill into effect it
will never work, and the Government and
the country will suffer the consequences.
I submit these observations solely on one
phase of the matter. I do not object to the
principle of establishing a board for the purpose named, but I beg of the Government to
spare no pains whatever, and to use every
means in their power, to get the right man to
I would remind honourable
do the job.
members that when munitions production became the crying need of civilization in the
last war, the British Government appointed
one man on this continent and put him in full
charge. They never in any way restrained
him, and because he was a man with years of
business experience and training he succeeded,
under competitive conditions, in bringing the
cost of munitions down to a mere fraction of
what it had been when he entered the service.
That saved this country much, and saved
Great Britain and the Allies vastly more.
That is the way to save. There is no other
way.
I make these observations because I believe
the atmosphere is much heavier than the
Government are willing to admit, though in
reality, I think, they know the situation as
well as I do, or even better.
I should like to
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
put a question to my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), whose authority I recognize. Is he aware of the status
of the Creusot industry in France? I should
like to know whether it is government-owned
or is a private undertaking.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the industry has been taken over by the Government because, first of all, the Government
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

of Mr. Blum had reduced the working week
to forty hours, and when they decided to restore the forty-eight-hour week it was practically necessary to bring the labouring people
in under mobilization. But in France the
Creusot armament factory has been in existence for many years. I remember being
shelled in South Africa in 1900 by Creusot
shells. To take over an existing industry in
time of war is one thing; to set about the
creation of an industry is a very different
thing.
The French
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Government have bought or expropriated that
part of the Creusot industry which manufactures munitions of war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I beg this
Government not to follow that example.
They cannot,
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
because there is no such industry to take over.
As I do not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sec any of my colleagues rising to express an
opinion on this Bill, and as it has been
received sympathetically, I would ask that it
be read a second time now. In so doing I
would inform the House, after conference
with my right honourable friend, that I am
going to propose that it then be sent to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand the
Bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT
STORES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 39, an Act to amend
the Department of Transport Stores Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
amends the Department of Transport Stores
Act, which was passed at the last session.
It has been found in practice that the Stores
Act did not, in one or two particulars, acIt will be
complish what was intended.
remembered that the Act gave authority to
consolidate the stores of the separate branches,
that is, the Canals Branch, the Lighthouse
Branch, the Radio Branch, the Marine Branch
and the Aviation Branch. It also provided
that the department could anticipate the
appropriations for the fiscal year to the extent
of $1,000,000. The reason for that provision
is that, at the beginning of the fiscal year,
it is necessary to move large quantities of
supplies to lighthouses and to undertake certain works having to do with the opening of

177

expenditures up ta 81,000,000 couhd be made
tram the appropriations af the next fiscal year,
but the Auditor General bas interpreted the
word "appropriations" as meaning maney that
bas been voted by Parliament. That is, in
spite of the intent of the Act, the Auditor
General has nat permittcd the department ta
use funds in advance of those actually being
voted by the House. The amount ai such
purchases is stihi limitcd ta a maximum af
$1,000,000, but this alaws us ta anticipate
appropriations ta that extent in order ta
facilitate the work of the department.
The other change is in connection with the
maximum amount of stores allowed ta be in
stock at the end af the fiscal year. The Act
now provides that the amount of stares should
flot be in excess of the amount held by the
department at the end of the preceding fiscal
year, which amount is about $850,000. On
an examination of the work ai the department,
and in view of the extension of the Aviation
Branch, it has been determined that the
maximum amount ai stores at the end ai a
fiscal year should be fixed at not more than
$1,250,000 instead ai as pravided under the
Act as it now stands.
1 think honourable members will sce that
the Bill is simphy an administrative or departmental mensure. which wouhd grant the
departuient a certain iacility in spending
money ini advance af the amount voted. 1
suppose my right honourable iriend opposite
is au fait with the Bill.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes, I have
read it.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
this Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there is no
objection, I would move third reading now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: There is no
reason why it should not go through. The
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) of
course realizes that the Bill empowers this
Government to spend money bel ore it is
voted by Parliament. I hope he will remember that a iew short years hence, when he is
sitting an this side ai the House.
Han. Mr. LACASSE: A misapprehension.
The powers

FOREIGN

INSURANCE
BILL

COMPANIES

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 53, an Act to amend
the Foreign Insurance Campanies Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable sena tors, this Bill
is based on a principle whieh we adopted
]ast year. The object is ta extend ta foreign
insurance companies doing business in Canada
the same investrnent facilities as were extended
one year ago ta our Canadian campanies. It
wilI be rememnbered that the Canadian companies a year ago were given the right ta
invest in equipment trust certificates of Canadian railways. I deait with the matter fully
at that time. The effect of this Bill is to
extend ta foreign insurance companies doing
business in Canada the same right to invest
with respect ta their Canadian business. It
alsa gives themn a right, like that granted
to Canadian insurance companies, ta inveat in
certain new types af public-utility invcstments in Great Britain. The best examples
I can give of the type of quasi-gavernment
or quasi-private institution are the Part of
London Autharity, and the Landau Transport
Board. a new type of financial set-up which
has corne into being in recent years, in the
securities of which, until hast year, aur Canadian insurance companies were not allawed ta
invest.
Rizlht Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, 1 arn in favour af the Bill,
but I do not understand the honourable
leader's explanation. The Bill does add ta the
class of investments which are eligible for
companies operating under the Foreign Insurance Campanies Act, 1932, and quite properhy
adds ta them, in my judgment. But the hanourable leader said we made the same extension hast year in respect of Canadian companies. I flnd there is before us this session
Bill 54, an Act ta amend the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act, 1932, which
provides that the very same class of investmeut as the present Bill makes eligible far
foreign insurance companies shahl be eligible
for Canadian and British companies. If wc
made this chass eligible far Canadian companies
hast year, we should not be doing it again
this year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The explanatory note to. Bill 54, ta which, my right hanourable friend alhudes, says this:
The effeet of this amendment is ta extend
the second seheduhe of the Act, setting out the
assets af British insurance campanies doing
business in Canada which may be included as
assets in Canada for the purposes af the Act,
ta include equipment trust certificates af Canadian railways and the securities issued by certain publie bodies or authorities in Great
Britain and some of the Dominions which are

exceptions, adaptations and modifications, to
carriage by air which is not international carriage within the meaning of the Convention,
and for purposes connected therewith.-Hon.
Mr. Dandurand.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
very same class which is being added with
respect to foreign insurance companies.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill seems
to be somewhat voluminous.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister
alludes to the investment facilities which were
extended last year to our Canadian companies.
light Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
Minister is wrong.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members, I think the explanation given by the
hionourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is
quite clear. Bill 54, the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Bill, refers to the second
schedule of the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act, which applies only to British
companies.
We extended the investment
facilities to Canadian companies last year;
so à is not necessary to make a similar
extension to them this year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
that in the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act there is one schedule of investnents eligible for British companies, and one
schedule of investments eligible for Canadian
companies. Is that so?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Tat is the way I
read this Bill 54.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
want to speak definitely about it, but I thought
there was one schedule. Anyway, the present
Bil is all right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If second reading is given to-day, I will not move third
reading until to-morrow, at which time I hope
to have full information.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 75, an Act to amend
the Meat and Canncd Foods Act (Fish and
He said: The purpo6e of this amendmcnt is
to enable the Department of Fisheries to ontrol by regulation a fa.st growing business in
fresh or frozen lobster meat. The meat is
slightly cooked only, and not proce.ssed in
the usual way, and does flot come under the
provisions of the Act. The fresh or frozen
lobster meat is packed under conditions that
are not always sanitary, and it is proposed,
with the authority which this amendment
would give, to control by regulation this
method of packing lobster mneat.
Paragraph (a) of section 2 of the present
Act read.s:
(a) "can" and "canned fish or shellfish" includes any hermetically sealed glass bottie,
package or container, and any fisb or shellfish
processed or preserved in the usual way packed
in such caus, bottie, package or container.
It is proposed to amend this paragraph by
adding the following:
also lobster meat cooked for sale, f resh or
frozen and packed in a can, bottle, package or
other container, but not preserved to keep, as
is the case with lobster meat processed or preserved in the usual way.
The second amendment is tbe addition to
subsection 1, section 26, of the words "in a
plain and conspicuous manner." The purpose
of this amendment is to require that the
habelling on imported cans of fish and shellfish
shaîl show the kind and quality of the
contents, the minimum weight and tbe place
of origin, and so on, in a plain and conspicuous
manner. At present importations from foreign
countries have 'been fo>und 'with the place of

specifically mentioned in the section of the
Act dealing .with importations, the proposed
amendment is necessary.
I would suggest that the Bill be given second
reading noýw and referred to Committee of the
Whohe in order that we may deal with one
or two small amendments rwhich our Larw
Clerk bas suggested.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 bave bad
no request from anyone to be heard on this
Bill. If the leader of the House or the
chairman of the committee bas had none,
there is no reason why the Bill sbould not go
to Committee of the Whole. I am in thorough
accord with the Law Clerk's suggestion,
though, that the 'words in brackets shouhd be

struck out of the titie. He makes that one
suggestion only.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might do
that nowý
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Murdock in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On the titie:
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I move that the
words "(Fish and Shellfish)" in the titie be
stricken out. The titie ýwill then read: "An
Act to amend the Meat and Canned Foods
Act."
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What is the reason for
the change, Mr. Chairman?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps I may
explain that. If this Bill after enactment were
to remain for evermore on our Statute Book,
there would be no objection to the titie, but
as soon as our Statutes are revised this amendment becomes a part of the original Act, and
the force of the Bill is spent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendments
are incorporated in the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the original
Act. Therefore the titie of this Bill sbould be
akin to that of the Act.
The titie, as amended, was agreed to.
The Bill, as amended, was reported.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Wben shahl this
Bill, with the amended titie, be read a third
time?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggestI hope 1 shahl fot be misunderstood-that in
the records of the House there shouhd appear
a motion to adopt the amendment reported by
the Committee. I do tbis because it is very
important to keep tbe record straigbt in case
later on there is a dispute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANiD: Yes. In fact,
I thought Hie Honour the Speaker had put a
motion to that effect.
The amendment was concurred in.

FOR

SECOND

ARRANGEREADING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND mioved the
second rcading of Bill 86, an Act to amend The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, hast year we
had a very long discussion over an amendment
that wve passed to The Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement
Act. We left out of the
operation of our amendinent the provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan, but we decided in
the case of Manitoba to put an end to the
activities un(hcr tie Act by June 30, 1939.
Now a strong request bas come from the
Governiment of Manitoba and from other
institutions in that province, for the reinstatement of Manitoba on the sanie basis as the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The opinion ivas expressed last year, I
think, that the Act hiad heen iutroducedi mainly
to help the Western provinces, and that it
had been a doubtful gift to the middle and
Eastern provinces. Opinion was flot unanimous on this point, but there secmed to be
unanimiity, at aIl events, as to the reason why
thc Act was put on the Statute Book in 1932,
namiely the distressiýng conditions in the West.
The amendiment which is submitted in this
Bill reads as follows:
Subsection three of section eleven of The
Fariners' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as
enacted by section nine of chapter forty-seveii
of the statutes of 1938, is repealed and the
following substituted therefor:
"(3) No proposaI shahl be received in the
province of British Columbia later than the
thirtieth day of June, 1939, nior ini any other
province except the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta later than the thirtyfirst day of December, 1938: Provided that
this subsection shaîl flot apply to farmers who
are soldier settlers within the meaning of the
Soldier Settlement Act."
The Act which is amended ran:
No proposal shaîl be received in either of
the provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia
hater than the thirtieth day of June, 1939.
Manitoba is reincorporated in the Act; British
Columbia still remains out.

181

APRIL 19, 1939
The following statement has been piaced
in my hands:
It will be recalled that at the last session a
number of amendments to the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act were passed by
the House of Commons and referred to the
Senate for consideration.
One of these amendments provided that no
new proposai might be filed by any farmer
or accepted by any Official Receiver in any
province on or after a date to be fixed by
proclamation of the Governor in Council.
The Senate did not agree with the House
of Commons on this amendment and the Bill
was returned by the Senate with a further
amendment which provided that no new proposai should be received in any province,
except Saskatchewan and Alberta, later than
the 3lst of December, 1938.
The House of Commons did not accept this
amendment.
In accordance with the procedure provided
for such cases, managers were appoin.ted by the
Senate to meet with managers appointed by the
House of Commons in a free conference, and
a compromise agreement was reached which
provided that no new proposai should be
received in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec,
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island later than the 3sit of December, 1938, nor in the provinces of Manitoba
and British Columbia later than the 30th of
June, 1939, but that the restriction should not
apply to farmers who are soldier settiers within
the meaning of the Soldier Settlement Act. No
termination date was provided in the cases of
Alberta and Saskatchewan.
During the year dissatisfaction bas been
expressed in Manitoba that the Act was te be
terminated in that province, and representations have been received from the United
Farmers of Manitoba, the Manitoba Cooperative Conference, the Canadian Chamber
of Agriculture, and, notabiy, from the Provincial Legishature.
In view of conditions prevailing as a result
of last year's crop, the Legishature of the
province, it is understood, requested by unanimous resolution that the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act should be eontinued in
Manitoba on the samne basis as it is being
continued in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The
object of this Bill is to comply with that
request and to place Manitoba in the .saine
position as Saskatchewan and Alberta.
This Bill will have no effect, by inference
or otherwise, on the operations of the Act in
any province outside of Manitoba. In its
application it is limited to Manitoba.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman consent to sending the Bill to
a committee? The right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who
is out of the House at the moment, would
like to have the Bill sent to cammittee, or
else to have second reading postponed until
to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIGmorrow.

Then I move
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
that the debate stand adjourned until tomorrow. 1 do not know why we should go

as this one, though of course there may be
a good reason for doing so.

Hie said: The purpose of the Bill is ta enable
the company ta issue bonds, debentures, or
other securities ta the extent of $750,000,
secured on lands and property owned by the
campany.
Although
the word "railway"
appears in the titie of the company. its interest
is confined wholhy ta real estate. There is
some question of jurisdiction. At the hast
sitting of the Legisiature of New Brunswick
a simihar bill was enacted.
This Bill is
presented as a concurrent measure because
originally the operations of the campany were
dechared ta be a work for the general
advantage of Canada. I do nlot think there
cao bc any possible objection ta the Bill.
I would suggest thaf after it lias been given
second reading it be refcrred ta the Comnmittee an Baniking and Commerce. As I have

SUBMARINE

IN HALIFAX

HARBOUR

DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Honourable
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I should like to raise a question of
national interest. I have already spoken to
my honourable friend the leader of the Government on the matter, but I fancy he has no
more information on it than any of the
rest of us.
A dispatch in this morning's papers describes
the appearance of a mysterious submarine in
the harbour at Halifax. The witnesses are
Captain William Latter, who commands the
Halifax pilot boat, and Pilot Patrick Sullivan,
who was on the same boat. These two gentlemen agree in saying that they were within
thirty yards of the submarine and that they
observed it for half an hour.
Now, unless these two men are utterly unreliable, I submit that a very definite piece
of information is before the country at this
moment. The hour was- twelve midnight,
and it was dark. If this was a submarine,
it was making a stealthy approach. It was not
a Canadian submarine, because there are
none; it was not a British submarine, because,
if it had been, it would have reported long
ago; and a further dispatch says it was not
an American submarine. I submit, therefore.
it had no right to be there, and was making a
stealthy survey of the outer reaches of the
harbour.
As I say, the leader of the Gôvernment probably has no more information on this subject
that I have, but I should like to express the
opinion that the evidence here is sufficient
to justify a partial manning of the guns
and lights which bear on the harbour at Halifax, and that in case a stealthy approach of
this kind is made at night, particularly by a
submarine as distinguished from a surface craft,
the vessel should be fired upon at sight. We
should put a stop to this sort of stealthy and
secret reconnaissance of our defences.

183

My honour
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend is quite right in inferring that I
have no information to justify me in giving
an answer at this moment. I shall try to
obtain some information for to-morrow, if any
has reached the department.
Honourable
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF:
senators, I wonder if I may add a rather
complimentary word about newspapers published in the city of Halifax and in the province of Nova Scotia, for the way in which
they have handled the matter referred to by
the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach). No doubt honourable members read very carefully this morning, as I
did, a certain dispatch from Halifax. I have
read several other dispatches also, and have
received some letters from Nova Scotia, about
the supposed presence of this so-called submarine in waters either within or without
the three-mile limit along the coast of Nova
Scotia. While I am willing to pay a compliment to the Halifax newspapers and the Canadian Press for sending these dispatches forth
to the people all over Canada and throughout
the world, I come from Missouri and I am
rather inclined to think it is a fish story.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: A sea serpent.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It may be a sea serpent,
or something else. My own opinion is that
there was no submarine. So far as I can understand, our people have been alarmed by
being made to think that there was a submarine which came from some European country. It seems to me rather strange, if Captain
Latter and Pilot Sullivan saw this submarine
within thirty yards of their pilot boat, around
twelve o'clock at night, that they did not put
into Herring Cove and notify the Admiralty
authorities at once. Instead of that, Captain
Latter waited and did not make his report
till he got into Halifax next morning. I
think the whole thing is ridiculous and without a word of truth. But I believe that if
there was a submarine, the British Government and the Canadian Government know
very well where it came from. If Captain
Latter was within thirty yards of that submarine, why the hell didn't he ram her?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is the spirit.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He said the submarine
was awash, that her lights were showing and
that he was within thirty yards of her. His
boat had a speed of ten knots, yet he allowed
the submarine to escape. If he had rammed
and sunk her there would have been one
Italian or German submarine less when the
war starts this year or next, and he would
have been a hero. I think the whole thing is
nonsense.

CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
THIRD

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 54, an Act to amend
The Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable members, yesterday
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) asked me why we were again
amending the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act, it having been amended last
session. At the moment I could not state
the reason. I surmised that last year we
probably amended the first part of the Act
concerning Canadian insurance companies and
neglected to deal with the second part, which
concerns British insurance companies. I find
I was correct in my surmise. The purpose
of this Bill is simply to complete the work
begun last year. extending to these companies
the privilege already granted to the Canadian
companies.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

CARRIAGE BY AIR BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUIL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 61, an Act to give effect
to a Convention for the unification of certain
rules relating to International Carriage by
Air, to make provision for applying the rules
contained in the said Convention, subject to
exceptions, adaptations and modifications, to
carriage by air which is not international
carriage within the meaning of the Convention,
and for purposes connected therewith.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

He said: The purpose of the Bill is to give
effect to the Warsaw Convention, signed at
Warsaw the 12th October, 1929, for the unification of certain rules relating to international
carriage by air, and to give power to the
Governor in Council to apply the rules of the
convention to internal carriage by air in
Canada.
The Warsaw Convention consists of provisions concerning the carriage of passengers,
goods and baggage, the liability of carriers
and limitation of liability, known as the
Warsaw Rules, which are designed to govern
contracts of carriage in relation to international carriage by air, and which form the
first schedule to the Bill.
The second schedule to the Bill contains
provisions relating to the liability of a carrier
in the event of the death of a passenger, which
follow generally the provisions of the Fatal
Accidents Acts.
The Warsaw Convention applies to all
international carriage of persons, baggage, or
goods, performed by aircraft for hire. It
applies equally to gratuitous carriage by
aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking, but not to carriage performed under
the terms of an international postal convention.
Paragraph 2 of article 1 defines "international carriage " as
any carriage in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure
and the place of destination, whether or not
there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories
of two high contracting parties, or within the
territory of a single high contracting party, if
there is an agreed stopping place within a
territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty,
mandate or authority of another power, even
though that power is not a party to this convention. A carriage without such an agreed
stopping place between territories subject to
the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same high contracting party is not
deemed to be international for the purpose
of this convention.
Chapter II contains provisions relative to
documents of carriage and determines the
scope and use of passenger tickets (article 3),
baggage tickets (article 4), and bills of lading
(articles 5 to 16).
Chapter III determines the liability of the
carrier. He is liable for damage sustained in
the death or injury of a passenger on board
aircraft or during embarking or disembarking
(article 17); for damage sustained to any
registered baggage or goods during the carriage
by air (article 18); and for damage caused
iby delay (article 19). He is not liable if he
proves that he and his agents have taken all
necessary and possible measures to avoid the
damage; and in the carriage of goods and
baggage (but not of passengers), he is not
liable if he proves that the damage was caused

APRIL 20, 1939
by negligent pilotage or negligence in the
handling of the aircraft or in navigation
(article 20). If the carrier proves that the
damage was caused by or contrilbuted to by
the negligence of the injured person, the Court
may exonerate the carrier wholly or partly
from his liability (article 21).
By article 22 the liability of the carrier is
limited to 125,000 French gold francs per
passenger, a gold franc having a value in
Canadian currency of about 6-7 cents, depending on the rate of exchange. Nevertheless,
by special contract, the carrier and the
passenger may agree to a higher limit of
liability. By article 22 the carrier's liability
for registered baggage and goods is limited to
250 francs per kilogram, and for baggage of
which the passenger himself takes charge,
the maximum is 5,000 francs per passenger.
The carrier's liability is not excluded or
limited if the damage is caused by his wilful
misconduct, or by what is considered by the
Court to be the equivalent; and this provision
extends to any agent of the carrier acting
within the scope of his employment (article 25).
Provisions are made under articles 28, 29
and 30 for settling claims for damages.
Chapter IV contains provisions relating to
combined carriage, performed partly by air
and partly by any other mode of carriage,
and in this case article 31 applies the provisions of the convention only to the carriage
by air.
Chapter V contains general and final provisions. Article 32 reserves the right to
insert arbitration clauses in contracts of carriage. Articles 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41
contain provisions regarding ratification, accession and denunciation of the convention,
and other related provisions.
The Warsaw Convention is in force in the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Eire, France, Germany and
practically all European countries where international air transport services are carried on,
and in the United States of America and
Mexico.
It may be noted that the President of the
United States has availed himself of the provisions of the Additional Protocol to the
said convention by declaring at the time of
accession that the first paragraph of article
2 of the convention, relative to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted
public bodies, shall not apply to international
transportation that may be performed by the
United States of America or any territory or
possession under its jurisdiction.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honoutable senators, this Bill is much like those
measures which came before this House about
the enid of the last Parliament in the form

18à

of legislation ratifying conventions approved
at Labour Conferences. There can, of course,
be no question as to the powers of the
Dominion Parliament in reference to a convention of this kind, which happily deals
with a subject already declared wholly within
Dominion jurisdiction, namely, aviation. One
wonders, though, what would be the consequence if it dealt with other things, as conventions inevitably will do. We are now
under the necessity of dealing with international matters through the medium of nine
provinces-one of the most grotesque situations arising out of the most inexplicable
judgment ever handed out by the Privy
Council. That necessity does not arise here,
as by a very excellent judgment of some five
years ago the subject of aviation was placed
irrevocably and indisputably within the range
of Dominion jurisdiction.
It is only from the material supplied by
the honourable leader of the House that I
know the terms of the Warsaw Convention,
now being made applicable to Canada. I
apprehend there are very important limitations to the liabilities which those who travel
by air, or who ship goods by air, have always
understood were available to them. The
limitations are drastic. Personally, I think
they are necessary. No doubt the nations
represented at Warsaw considered the subject
very thoroughly. I an impressed by the fact
that many countries have already ratified the
convention, and particularly the United States,
which has also adhered to the Additional
Protocol. Therefore it seems to me proper
for the Parliament of Canada to approve the
convention.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: On reading the
Bill I was impressed with the importance of
giving the fullest publicity to the fact that
the coming into force of the convention will
make a great difference to Canadians who
travel by air. It will come as a distinct
shock to many to find that if, for example,
they embark on an airplane bound from
Toronto to Chicago, or to any other place
beyond the international boundary, they are
subject to laws very different from those
which apply to air transport between Canadian points.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: I wonder if
any honourable senators have noticed that
the high contracting parties to the convention
of October 12, 1929, as set out in the first
schedule, include, among others, the Federal
President of the Republic of Austria, His
Majesty the King of Spain, and the President
of the Czechoslovak Republic. I do not
know whether we should take cognizance of
the fact that those titles no longer exist.

186

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But they existed
at the time the convention was entered into.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understand that.
But under the changed conditions will those
who are now in authority in those three
countries adhere to this convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would draw
moy bonourable friend's attention to the fact
that the German Reich bas approved of the
convention. If the annexation of Austria and
Czechoslovakia is recognized by the signatories of the convention, I would say that
Germany's signature covers those countries,
which perhaps, up to this date, have not
sanctioned this convention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about Franco?
h'bat about Spain?
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Spain may
have had a change of government, but it is
still Spain.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hlon Mr. DANDURAND:
If there is no

RAINY LAKE WATERSHED
EMERGENCY CONTROL BILL
On the Order:
The House in Committee of the Whole on
Bill 72, an Act to carry into effect the provisions of the Convention of the 15th September,
1938, providing for emergency regulation of the
level of Rainy Lake and of the level of other
boundary waters in the Rainy Lake watershed.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, the convention which this Bill
is intended te ratify carries out a unanimous
recommendation of the International Joint
Commission. This recommendation followed
an extensive investigation by the commission,
together with bearings at which the provinces
of Ontario and Manitoba were represented.
On the point dealt with by the convention the
recommendation of the commission accepts in
substance the contentions submitted to the
commission by all the interested governments,
including that of Ontario. The convention
can therefore be regarded as carrying out the
policy approved of by the accredited representatives of that province.
The convention and the proposed legislation
proceed upon the assumption that the subjectmatter is primarily and directly Dominion,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

as distinct from provincial. The convention
and the Bill deal with the control and regulation of boundary water matters clearly
beyond the legislative authority of a province.
Though the subject-matter of the convention
is clearly within the competence of the
federal authorities, it swas recognized that
there was an important, indirect interest of
the Ontario Government, and a much less
important, indirect interest of the Manitoba
Government in this matter. Accordingly, at
the end of May, 1938, three and one-half
months before signature Qf the convention,
but after the draft had been tentatively approved by the Canadian and United States
Governments, copies of the draft were communicated to the appropriate authorities in
Ontario and Manitoba. It was then pointed
out that, while the convention carried out
recommendations of the commission and a
policy which had been approved by all of the
Canadian interests represented at the conference. it dealt with matters of direct interest
to Ontario and of indirect interest to Manitoba, and that it was accordingly being transmitted to those Governments for their information. No communication bas been received
from either of the provincial governments,
and there is no indication of any departure
from the position that bas been maintained
by them throughout.
With these explanations, I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Bill was read
a second time yesterday, and we should now
he in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then I move
the Bill into Committee of the Whole.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Is it the
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
If there is
a motion to go into Committee of the Whole,
then, of course, I may speak; but I do not
think there is. I think we automatically go
into Committee of the Whole without a
motion.
But I understood his Honour the
Speaker to mention a motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Is it the
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yesterday
I mentioned a question that was in my mind
respecting this Bill. Apparently it was not
apprehended by the honourable leader of the
Government, for the information he bas given
to the House does not deal with it at all.
The information given is to the effect that
this is a boundary water; that there come
periods of emergency, due to low water or

187

APRIL 20, 1939
high water, when the level must he controlled; that the International Joint Commission recommendled that a convention be
entered into between the two countries for
the control nf this boundary water by a board;
that the Government of Canada got into
touch with Ontario, which is interested in a
major way, and wit Manitoba, interested in
a minor way, and that terms were agreed to
by those provinces. I do not question al
that, but wvbat bothers me is this. The International Joint Commission, which is established by statutes ni the two nations, bas jurisdiction in respect ni boundary waters. It
bas more than that, I know. It bas to do
with boundaries beyond the water boundaries. But that it bas jurisdiction over boundary water is incontestable. This being sa,
why do the terms ni control not came under
the powers ni the International Joint Commission?
Then there is a Lake of the Woods Control Board. I cannot recaIl just how close
the Lake of the Woods is to Rainy Lake, but
it is part ni the same system. The honourable
senator from Winnipeg South-Centre (Han.
Mr. Haig) bas the geography in mind more
definitely than I have. The Lake oi the
Woods Control Board exists, as I apprehend,
under the general authority oi the International
Joint Commission. A Canadian board controls levels as long as they are within two
extremes, a certain high as a maximum and
a certain low as a minimum. When the water
gets above the maximum or beloW~ the minimum, if my recollection. is right, an international board is in control.
What ought ta be explained, it seems ta
me, is this. Why is the Lake of the Woods
Cantrol Board not the proper authority to
deal witb this matter, and why could it not
be done under the general authority ai the
Joint Commission rather than by this lengthy
process ni entering into anather convention
with the United States?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that,
having sa many Bills before me, I forgot that
the question naw repeated had been put by
my right honourable iriend. I have not had
time ta turn around and obtain information
which bas been requeeted on certain Bis, and
that is why one af thcm bas been ,postponed
until to-marrow. Perhaps I can find the
answer in the debate which took place in the
other House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is the answer not
ta be iound in the explanatory notes right
opposite the Bill? Here is wihat is stated:
The International Joint Commission conducted
an inquiry and made a report ta the Gaveraments on the first day of March, 1934, including
the f ollowing recommendation.

And here is the recommendation:
The commission, however, submits that it
would be wise and in the publie intereat that
the commission be clothed with power to determine when unusual or extraordinary conditions
exist throughout the watershed, whether by
reason of high or low water, and that it be
empowered to adopt such measures of control
as to it may seem proper with respect to existing
dams at Kettie Falls and International Falls, as
well as any future dams or works, in the event
of the commission determining that such unusual
or extraordinary conditions exist.
That seeros to me to be the answer as to the
necessity of this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN: If thc honourable gentleman will follow me, he will underI know that the
stand my difficulty.
Governmcnt of Canada. with the Governments oi Ontario and Manitoba, considered
the desire expressed in a resolution of the
International Joint Commission that the
commission be given a certain measure of
control, allowed to appoint a board, and so
forth, with respect to emergent conditions
that might arise in Rainy Lake. I know that
is the origin of the convention signed in
September of last year. But I cannot get at
the reason why the International Joint
Commission bas not sufficient authority now.
It bas general authority in respect of boundary water, and Rainy Lake is a boundary
water. Why must there be a new convention
in order that authority may be exercised in
respect of Rainy Lake? No doubt there is
an answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is an
answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I cannot
think what it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we go into Committee of the Whole,
so that our discussion may be regular.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Duf! in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Now my right
honourable friend may proceed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I can anly
repeat that the Lake of the Woods Control
Board has ail the authority. I do not understand wby this Bill is necessary.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It bas authority in Canada only.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
only in Canada. I know there is an international board, which supersedes the Canadian board wben the water rises above a certain maximum and also when it falls helow

188

SENATE

a certain minimum, because at those points
American interests become involved. I cannot understand what need there is for this
Bill, why the powers that are proposed to be
given here are not in the original powers, or,
if they are in the original powers, why the
Lake of the Woods Control Board does not
do the work.

The International Joint Commission has control of the entire situation. The commission is
in the nature of an arbitration tribunal, and it
would direct by whom the expenses should be
met. Undoubtedly it would in some cases give
directions as to precautions to prevent flooding
and would determine in such cases how those
particular measures were to be enforced. The
text of the convention as a whole appears as
a schedule.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it not because-

That does not give the answer which my
right honourable friend is seeking as to the
co-existence of the Lake of the Woods Control Board. I would move-

The CHAIRMAN: Order.
On section 2-interpretation:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it not because
the original convention gave the board
authority to maintain proper and existing
water levels. whereas this Bill, at least as I
read it, contemplates the raising of the water
levels in that territory for the benefit of
industrial undertakings in the state of Minnesota? I may be entirely wrong, but that
is my understanding.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before my honourable
friend makes his motion, I would suggest that
probably section 7 of the Bill covers the
point. When the commission pushes the waters
back they may flood private property in
Canada as well as in the United States, and I
think the object is to give the commission
control of the private property in Canada that
it needs.

Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND: I should have
brought to my right honourable friend an
answer to his inquiry with respect to the Lake
of the Woods Control Board. I have no data
about this board, and no memory as to its
existence, but I may find something about it
in the statement made in another place by the
Prime Minister, who presented the Bill. He
said:
The reason for the extensive powers provided
for in this Bill is that the convention gives to
the International Joint Commission a type of
function that is essentially different from those
performed under the Boundary Waters Treaty.
The commission is to devise and carry out
emergency control measures. While in point of
form it is to deal with low-water emergencies,
practically speaking, in the great majority of
instances its work will be concerned with flood
conditions. The problem of coping with flood
conditions in international waters requires
extensive powers which would need to go to
the extent of the actual operation of an international dam in the case of emergency. It is
not anticipated that the commission will itself
operate the dams, but it must have the legal
power and authority to do so to ensure that
the companies operating the dams will obey its
directions. In most instances there is a serious
confliet between the owner of the dam and the
ordinary inhabitants.
The commission may
inevitably be compelled to give orders contrary
to the interests of the owners of dams, and it
is for this reason that the extensive powers are
conferred upon it.
The general scheme of the Bill is to extend
the powers and procedure under the Boundary
Waters Treaty to enable the commission to
perform the functions imposed upon it by the
convention, and to provide for the aid of the
Exchequer Court, if the necessity arises, to
ensure obedience by private interests to the
orders of the commission. Expenditures would
be made by the private interests and controlled
in the same manner as expenditures are controlled under the operations of the International
Joint Commission.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I apparently
have not succeded in making clear what
bothers me. Under the Waterways Treaty
Act the commission has authority in respect of
boundary waters. Now, what authority can
an international commission have in respect
of boundary waters except an authority to
control then? What else can such a commission do? There is no use in looking at
the waters. The commission cannot divert
them; I mean it cannot change the boundary.
In the original Act, power surely was given to
control boundary waters.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think that is
what is wanted here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What has the
commission been doing all these years in
respect of boundary waters?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it may be
that it is necessary to do some work exelusively in Canadian waters flowing from
boundary waters.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: If it is with
respect to Canadian waters which are not
boundary waters, we have no jurisdiction.
We can act only in a boundary waters area,
as, for instance, in the St. Lawrence river.
What bothers me is the question of what the
commission has been doing all these years in
respect of boundary waters, under the Act
which gives it authority over them, since it
now requests a new convention between the
United States and Canada in order to control
boundary water levels. That point has not
been explained by the Prime Minister. I do
not suggest that the Bill is entirely unnecessary, for I cannot conceive that the law
officers in Canada and the United States

APRIL 20, 1939
would approve a treaty unless it were necessary; but, either now or after the Bill is
passed, if I am not causing too much inconvenience to the Government, I should like to
be clearer on the point I have raised.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall the section carry?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I move
that the committee rise, report progress and
ask leave to sit again.
The motion was agreed to.
Progress was reported.
SEALS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 76, an Act to make
provision for the Sealing of Royal Instruments.
He said: Honorable senators, I am not
very familiar with the effect of this Bill. I
will bring to this Chamber the light which
I find in the explanatory notes.
The present Bill is intended to deal with two
separate problems. The first is temporary and
is a result of the prospective visit of His
Majesty the King. It is necessary to make
provision for the performance of the royal
functions in relation to the government of
Canada during the period of the King's absence
from the United Kingdom and presence in
Canada. For the most part, these royal funetions can be performed notwithstanding the
King's absence from the United Kingdom and
presence in this country. There are, however,
exceptional functions, particularly those which
require the use of the Great Seal of the Realm
and the Signets. During His Majesty's presence
in Canada, under existing laws and practice,
it would not be possible to issue royal instruments under the Great Seal or the Signet. The
present Bill makes provision for passing such
instruments under the Great Seal of Canada.
The second problem is to make permanent
provision for Canadian royal seals for use in
Canadian matters. At present there are certain
transactions which require instruments under
the Great Seal or Signets.
The following royal instruments, relating to
Canadian matters, are passed under the Great
Seal:
Full powers (authorizing the signature of
treaties and conventions);
Instruments of ratification (or treaties and
conventions);
Letters patent constituting the office of Governor General.
The following royal instruments relating to
Canadian matters are issued under the Sign
Manual and Signet:
Warrants authorizing the issuing of instruments under the Great Seal;
Commission appointing the Governor General;
Instructions to the Governor General;
Exequaturs;
Appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of Canada or of an Administrator;
Formal granting of leave of absence to the
Governor General;

189

Appointment of certain officers of the public
service of Canada.
(The International Boundary Commissioner,
members of the International Joint Commission. Generally, when provision is made in
a treaty or convention in the "Heads of
States" form, for appointment, and, if the
appointment is made by an instrument, the
instrument will be under the Sign Manual
Appointments of Ministers
and Signet.
Plenipotentiary, if a commission is issued,
are made under the Sign Manual and Signet.)
Both the Great Seal and the Signets are in
the custody of certain of His Majesty's Ministers in the United Kingdom, and the procedure
governing their use is largely based upon
statutes of the United Kingdom. There is conventional recognition of the obligation of such
Ministers, in Canadian matters, to use the seals,
which are in their custody, in accordance with
the request of the responsible Canadian Ministers. This conventional recognitioq finds its
expression in the modern practice with regard
to countersignature. In drafting royal instruments, in Canadian matters, it is made clear,
either by recitals or by provision for countersignature, that the responsiblity for the instrument is imposed upon a Canadian Minister.
The present Bill is designed to enable Canadian
transactions, involving the use of Royal Seals,
to be subjected, in form as well as in substance,
to the direct control of responsible Canadian
Ministers.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I read these explanatory
notes yesterday morning, but I am still somewhat befogged about a certain feature. The
explanatory notes state why it is necessary to
take certain action because of the royal visit,
but I do not think the Bill makes any
reference specially to the period of the royal
visit, though I may be wrong about that.
Certainly the recital contains no statement
that the Bill is required because of the
imminence of the royal visit. I know the
responsibility of the officials who have to do
with a matter of this kind, and I would ask
the honourable leader if he can give the House
assurance that the measure has the approval of
the Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Coleman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought I had
a letter here from the Department of External
Affairs, but I do not see it. In the circumstances I am unable to state whether the
measure came from Dr. Skel'ton or Dr.
Coleman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Secretary
of State is the oustodian of the Royal Seal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill ws
presented in the other House by the Minister
of Justice, but, as there was no question on
the point which my right honourable friend
has raised here, there was no occasion for any
statement about it by the Minister. The
Minister said, with respect to section 3:
As the explanatory note indicates this is the
operating provision of the Act. The necessity

SENATE
for this section arises more particularly from
the prospective visit of His Majesty the King.
During His Majesty's presence in Canada, it
would not be possible, under existing laws and
practice, to issue royal instruments in relation
to Canadian matters under the Great Seal or
the Signet of the United Kingdom.
His
Majesty may be called upon to issue such
instruments during the period of his visit in
Canada-that is, for Canadian matters-and
section 8 makes provision for the passing of
such instruments under the Great Seal of
Canada.
It may be that section 3 is drafted in
general terms so as to 'be applicable to any
occasion, not only the one now impending,
when His Majesty the King is in Canada.
There may be further royal visits, and I take
it that this proposed legislation would be
effective on every such occasion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have just read a discussion
which took place in the other House a few
days ago. I had heard about it, but had no
chance to read it earlier. The discussion
occurred, unfortunately, after the Bill was
passed there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was passed?

After the Bill

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Apparently.
On the Ordrs of the Day the former Secretary
of State, who was not present when the Bill
was hurried through, made some observations
upon it, with special reference to the Regency
Act of 1937, Chapter 16 of the Statutes of the
United Kingdom for that year. He emphasized the fact that, because of failure to recite
and comply with a certain provision of the
Statute of Westminster, the Regency Act did
not affect Canada. I quote bis words in order
to be certain I am not misinterpreting them:
The Regency Act, 1937, as enacted at Westminister, does not recite that Canada has
requested and consented to its enactment as
provided in section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, which enacts that"4. No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed after the commencement of this
Act, shall extend, or be deemed to extend to a
Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion,
unless it is expressly declared in that Act that
the Dominion bas requested, and consented to
the enactment thereof."
It is therefore possible that the Regency Act,
1937, may not automatically extend to Canada
as a part of the law of this Dominion.
Then he put certain questions to the Minister of Justice. I am going to read those
questions and address them to the Government as my own, because they were not answered in the other House, the Minister of
Justice taking the ground that the Bill, having
been passed by the Commons, had to come
Hon. Mr.

)ANDURAND.

before this Chamber and the questions could
be dealt with here. These are the four questions:
1. Will a regent, appointed under the Regency
Act, ipso facto, assume the performance of all
royal functions relating to Canada, hitherto
performed by His Majesty in person?
2. If not, why was not the necessary request
made and consent given by Canada so that by
its terms the Regency Act would apply to
Canada?
3. Is it assumed by the Government that, by
the terms of the British North America Act,
or otherwise, Canada now has the legislative
authority to provide for the appointment of
a regent in case the necessity should arise?
4. Wiat is now Canada's constitutional position in relation to the appointment of councillors of state under the terms of the Regency
Act?
I have to confess freely that I am not
very clear as to the relativity of these questions to the BillHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

out by statute.
Personally. I was never
aware there were any other seas. There may
be others appropriate to the ratifying of
diplomatie executive a-ts, and so forth.
If the Government do not sec fit ta answer
the questions I have just cited, I sthould like
to know: (1) Why is it that this Bill is necessitated by the royal visit? There is notbing
in the explanatory notes to make that clear.
(2) If it is applicable only ta the period of
the royal visit, why does the Bill make no
reference thereto?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Because, I
surmise, it is a general Act which would
not apply solely to a visit of His Majesty
the King, but could be applied whenever he
might be in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Perhaps that

is sO.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
After the Bill
has been given second reading I shall ask
that it be put down for third reading tomorrow, although, like my right honourable
friend, I do not see the relativity of the questions put by the former Secretary of State
ta the particulars of this Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

CoMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railway Company,
the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company,
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company and
the Toronto Terminais Railway Company.
He said: When this Bill was given first
reading my right honourable friend asked me
what was the occasion for the Federal Parliament intervening in the subjeet-matter. He
will understand that it is an Act respecting the
Canadian National Railway, the Ontario and
Quebec Railway CompanyRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I arn entirely clear on that subjeet now. These being
Dominion-constituted companies and the work
being described as for the general advantage
of Canada, I have no doubt at ail tha-t Parliament has legislative jurisdiction in respect of
the properties, and therefore bas power ta
pass this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then -there is
no occasion for me to, read the communications
which I have before me from the respective
presidents of the Canadian National and the
Canad.ian Pacific companies explaining the
whole situation.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Bouse, I move that this Bill he read
a third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
GRAIN FUTURES BILL
SECOND READING

Hlon. DUNCAN MARSHALL moved the
second reading of Bill 81, an Act ta provide
for the supervision and regulation of Trading
in Grain Futures.
He said: Honourable senators, let me eall
attention first to the fact mentioned by my
right honourable friend the leader across the

191

way (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), wbo questioned ta, some extent whetber this Bill might
be constitutional. I wish ta say at once that
I arn not going ta get into any legal argument with him or with sny other lawyer. As
a matter of f act, I have secured a little free
advice on the point from some of my legal
friends. I may say t-hat I got three kinds of
advice; which proves the old adage that there
are three sides ta every question: your side,
my side, and the right side. After listening
ta their advice I was not very clear as ta
what the situation was. "Who shall decide
Certainly not a
when doctors disagree?"
farmer. I remember being in court in Edmonton on one occasion wben a layman quoted
Waghorn's Guide as an authority on some
hegal matter, and Mr. Sifton asked him if
Waghorn was bis lawhorn. I tbink any citation I might make would be about as good
as tbat.
In my perplexity I asked tbe law officer of
tbe Crown ta give me a memnorandum on the
constitutional validity of this Bill, and I wilI
read it for the information of honourable
member s. It is as f ollows:
This question was fully canvassed when the
Bill was prepared, and it was considered that
trading in grain on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange (by means of which virtually the whole
of the Canadian wheat crop is marketed) could
certainly not be regardcd as a matter of merely
local or provincial (Manitoba) concern, but that
it was, by reason of the. magnitude of the
trading and the interprovincial and international character thereof, substantially a matter
of national concern. Upon this view, the legislation would be upheld as being in relation ta
the peace, order and good government of Canada or as being a good regulation of trade and
commerce.
I shall not argue whether that is good law,
but, as was stated by the Minister in charge
of the Bill in another Bouse, the law officer
of the Crown approved of the measure as
being constitutional, and it was passed by
the Bouse of Gommons.
I arn not very well acquainted with the
question of trading in futures, but it bas
agitated the people in Western Canada for
quite a period of years. In fact it hecame sa,
acute at one stage that a commission of
inquiry, prcsided over by Sir Josiah Stamp,
was appointed by the former Prime Minister
of this country. I happened ta, be west
when the commission was holding its sittings,
and I had the privihege of listening ta many
of the discussions and ta some of the evidence.
Sir Josiah Stamp reported that trading in
futures on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange
should be permitted.
Be said he got about the best description
of trading in futures from my aId friend the

192

SENATE

late George Langley. Sir Josiah asked himn
to state just what effeet trading in futures
had on the people. George said, "It is somnething liko drink; il kind of grows on one."
Sir Josiah, flot to bie outdone in humour,
replied, "Yos, Mr. Langley, but drink always
goes down, does il not?" George immediately
retorted, "Aye, but it sometirnes cornes oop
again." Sir Josiah Stamp said hie thought
that was about the hest description hie had
gained of the trading in wheat futures in
Canada.
I think those who at that lime were agitating for the abolition of trading in futures
have now corne 10 the conclusion that the
practice should flot be abolished altogether,
but should he regulated, and that the grain
Irade would be very difficult to handie if
suchi trading were not permilled.
From my knowledge of the feeling then
prevailing in Western Canada, and from
hearing some of the evidence and the disceussions hy opposing lawyers-it was a pretty
warmn court at times--I arn quite sure that if
the chairman of the commission had heen a
rnan of less ahility than Sir Josiah Stamp,
lie would have had very great diificully in
gettiog Western Canada to acccpt his judgment in the malter. But hoe handled il in an
exeodingly able and reasonable fashion, and
from lime to lime discussed with both Iawyers
and wilnesses the whole subject. sn Ihat
when hoe gave his decision the people of
Western Canada were ready to accept it as
quite a reasonable one.
Since that lime agitation hias grown for
the rogulation of tlie Winnipeg Grain Exchange, with the resuît that Ibis Bill was
inlroduced
the bouse of Gommons. The
Minister in charge of the Bill there stated
Ihat the Winnipeg Grain Exchange had discussed with ito the draft, Bill and had littie
or no objection to il; that as a matter of fact
most of the parties inlorested, if not ail, were
agreed that it was a reasonable and fair
measure.
The honourable mnemhcr from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig), on the motion
for first reading. asked what authority the
Governmnenl had for going furîher in Ihis
Bill 'than Mr. Justice Turgeon recommnended
in lus report. Mr, Euler maintaîns Ihat the
Gox ernment have not, bot if they had gone a
ltle further in some instances lhey cortainly
would have the right and authority 10 do so,
oecause, after ahl, the Governrnent are not
Dound by the letter of any commissionor's

some or aIl of the comnrissioner's recommendilions, or even go heyond them.
1 have not had lime 10 peruse Mr. Justice
rurgeon's report very carofully, but tbe

mbt

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

Minister assured me that this Bihl is based
very largely, in facl almost entirely, upon that
report.
Il represents t0 anme extent a
compromise ;between trwo opposing forces in
Western Canada, one calling for the abolition
of trading in futureýs on the Exchange, and
the other mainlaining that il should be
continuod.
If trading in futures were abolisb.od, I
suppose there would ibe no othor course open
10 the Government Ihan 10 ;buy and market
aIl the 'wbeat. In my opinion neither the
people nor the Government are prepared for
sucbi action aI the presenýt lime. We have had
a good many wheal difficulties in the pasl,
and we do nol want 10 'ho confronled iby any
additional ones.
From my perusal of the discussion in the
other House and a careful sludy of the Bill,
1 think it is a reasonahle measure and will
probably hring a'bout redress uinder any extraordýinary circîîîustances that may occur, 'by
the exereise of the powers provided.
I do not know whether Ibis Bill should 'he
referred 10 the Banking and Commerce
Commitîce or tci Committee of the Whole
buse. My own opinion is il would bo
preforable ho have il examined by the Banking
and Commerce Commiltee. I arn quite willing
10 take the advice of the House upon Ihat
malter, but the Banking and Commerce
Commiltee would have a chance 10 deal with
il clause hby clause in a more tborough way
tItan wouild hoe possible in Comrnihtoe of tbe
Whole bouse.
Righit lion. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourablo senalors, I welcome tbe suggestion
thal the Bill go to the Comnmittce on Banking
and Commerce. 1 rise only te refer 10 the
opinion read hby the bonourable member from
Pool (bon. Mr. Marshall) on the constitutional question raised yesterday. Il would,
I tbink, ho a mistake to make Ibis House a
forum for legal arguments on constitutional
matters, and I have no desire 10 encourage
thlaI, praclice, but I -want 10 rogister rny dissent
from the Justice Department's rallier cavalier
opinion on this subject.
Iît is truc a reading of the British North
America Act shows that tra(lo andi commerce
ia a subjeet genorally wilhin the purviow of
the Dominion Parliarnent. That is wbat the
memorandum mainly relies on. I think the
inlerprelalion inýtended hy the British North
Amorica-Adt was that when Parliament enacts
legialation dealing generally witb any subjeet
of trade and commerce and makes its applicalion Canadian-wide, Parliarnent should ho
within ils righlýs.
Deýcisiona of the Privy
Counecil have prolly seriously impugned that
interprotation.
bore, however, we, are not

APRIL 20, 1939
dealing generally with a subject. of trade and
commerce. Parliament is placing its finger
tupon certain operations in the city of
Winnipeg, and we say to John Brown, who is
thinking of selling to David Smith an option
on wheat, perhaps only 100 'bushels, deliverable
at a certain time: "You cannot make that
contract un-less somebody we appoint tells
you that hie consents." That is what is done
by this Bill. The. memorandum seems to
contemplate that if the deal is big enougli,
or if there is a sufficient num<ber of transactions, then our jurisdiction supersedes the
provincial. Well, where is the line drawn?
When is a deal ;big enough to be taken out of
the range of civil and private rights within the
province?
Remernber, the transaction is
solely there. The buyer is there, the seller is
there-or their respective representatives.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I should like
to put a question to my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meiglien). When lie
lived in the Western Provinces hie imbibed
their spirit and acquired a knowledge of the
trade in the principal product of the Westwbeat. Has hie given any thought to the fact
that the Western crop, which may be 300,000,000 or 500,000,000 bushels, coming from
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the
greater portion of it moving towards Lake
Superior, can be so much impeded in
operations on the Grain Exchange in Winnipeg that the welfare of those provines~ may
be affected in the return they receive for their
crops?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
the question of impeding the flow of grain
cornes in. 1 know that under the Grain Act,
over a period of some decades, we have
assumed juriadiction. I think it is a jurisdiction which the Britishi North Amnerica Act
intended to give us, but I would flot wager
too mucli even on the Grain Act in face of
judgments which would be considered binding.
If that Act went before the Privy Council, I
arn not s0 sure it would stand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It regulates.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It regulates
the movement and grading of grain. But that
is far more a matter of general supervision
of trade and commerce than this is, and therefore at least intended under the British North
America Act to be under federal jurisdiction.
What is sought to be supervised here is a
long series of individual transactions at a
certain spot in Winnipeg, and nowhere else.
,A and B sit across a table or stand in a
pit in Winnipeg, and B selîs to A so mucli
wheat, deliverable a month fruut nuw; and
this Parliament says that what A and B
71498-13

193

do is of national importance, and that we
can intervene and legislate. I do flot pretend to be a final authority, or a better
authority than anyone else in this House, but
I am going to go on record as anticipating that
the opinion read this afternoon will flot stand
the judgment of the Privy Council.
Hon. A. K. HIJGESSEN: I do not pretend to be any more of an expert on constitutional law than my right honourable friend,
but I should like to point out that the
opinion of the Justice Department does not
rest solely on trade and commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is
correct.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is justified also,
as being a matter in relation to the peace,
order and good government of Canada. From
a very cursory inspe~ction of the legislatiori
itself it seems to me the really importanit
governing words, the pith and substance of
tbe Bill, are to be found in the beginning of
section 8, which uses this language:
Whenever the Board is of opinion that transactions ia grain futures are causing or threatening to cause sudden or undue fluctuations in
the price of any kind of grain, the Board may-give suchi and sucli order. It is conceivable
that that would faîl within the peace, order
and good government of Canada in mucli the
saime way as the operations carried on under the
Combines Investigation Act, which bas been
hield by the Privy Council to be wxthin the
power of the Parliament of Canada respecting
combinations in restraint of trade.
There are probably as many opinions on
this question as there are lawyers in Canada,
but I venture to suggest tbat there may be
something in the contention that this Bill is
justified as coming within the purview of
Dominion legislation in the samne way as the
Combines Investigation Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should have
mentioned the fact that the opinion of the
Department of Justice does reat on the clause
regarding peace, order and good guverument.
That is the clause which lias been impaired
more than any other. The oontrast between
its present effect, after the Privy Council's
decisions, and the effect one reading it would
think it should have, is perhaps the greatest
of ail the results of references to the Privy
Council.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hear, hear.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It lias been
almost whittled away.
I cannot argue now, and will flot attempt
to argue, on the comparison of the situation
in this case and the situation under the
Combines Investigation Act. I ventured to

SENATE
question the constitutionality of this Bill
yesterday. I have had no opportunity whatever of getting the view of Parliamentary
Counsel, but when the Bill goes before the
Committee on Banking and Commerce we
shall be able to get his view, and for myself I
would attach very considerable importance to
it.
Hon. JOHN HAIG: Honourable senators,
in my judgment there is a feeling in Western
Canada that the producers, the handlers and
the consumers would like to have the control
of grain in all its branches under the Parliament of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
ought to be.

Surely.

It

Hon. Mr. HAIG: There bas been a very
strong feeling on both sides of this argument
for the last thirty years. It was about thirty
years ago, I think, that the first delegation
came to Ottawa. Throughout it bas been
most strenuously maintained that the right of
the Parliament of Canada to deal with grain
should not be taken away. The farmers may
be divided in their views on this Bill, but
they would not like to sec the rigbt of the
Parliament of Canada interfered with at all
in regard to grain questions.
I am not sure that the honourable leader
of the Government understands what these
transactions are that are referred to. They
are not actual dealings in grain at all, but a
hedging or betting, which is held to be legal.
There have been many lawsuits over such
transactions during the years. Recently it
was decided that they are not gambling
transactions; but they have nothing to do
with grain except as they affect the price. I
am a farmer and produce five thousand
bushels of grain. I take it to the local elevator and say I want it shipped to Fort
William. It is graded No. 2. I am able to
sell that through the dealers in the Grain
Exchange.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
transaction.

I know that

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Another one is this. I
can go into an office and say I want to buy
fixe thousand bushels of grain. I have sold
my five thousand bushels of actual grain. I
am hard up. but I think the price will increase. So I say I want to buy five thousand bushels of grain for October delivery,
which means I can demand tfive thousand
bushels at the price in October. I am told
the price of October grain is now sixty-four
cents, and I am asked for two cents or five
cents a bushel as a deposit. I pay over so
much money. and thc grain is delivered in
October, and I am charged a certain percentRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

age for what bas been done. Someone who
thought the grain might be worth only sixtytwo cents a bushel bas agreed to sell that
grain to me.
Those are the transactions
referred to here. I am persuaded that they
are legal transactions. But I think I voice
the opinion of everybody in Western Canada, purchaser, handler or consumer. that
we do not want anything that will make possible an attack on the whole Grain Act.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Is that not
exactly the same as buying stocks long or
short. which is legal?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not question the
legality. The courts have recently beld that
the transaction is legal, but I am afraid
that it is a local transaction, coming within
property and civil rights.
It may be a
private transaction within the confines of the
city of Winnipeg.
I ani v'ery glad the honourable gentleman
who is in charge of the Bill is having it
sent to thle Committee on Banking and Comimerce, because, after reading the bill very
carefulil, I arn of the opinion that therc are
clauses in it that go too far and that place
upon the Govecrmncot a responsibility which
they should not assume. I can specify thosec
clauses in the commitice.
There is another question. How is this
supervisor to be appointed? I am firmrly of
thc opinion that tho whole business should bc
absolutely under the control of the Board of
Grain Comrnissioners.
True, the Government have to pay the cost in any case, but
I an ofraid that if a supervisor is appointed
by the Government direct ie will build up
another organization in connection with his
office, whereas the whole subject should be
within the purfiw
ofonly the one organization. That is something which I think the
committee can arrange, and I hope it will
see that the responsibility is not placed upon
the Government. because the handling of grain
should be absolutely removed from governmental responsibility, exven if it is only ihat
entailed by the appointment of this man. It
is true that the Government appoint tire Board
of Grain Comnmissionrs, but it is appointed
for ten years, and it appoints tire inspectors.
I may say the staffs in this service have been
I would suggest that the
abov-e reproach.
clauses that go too far should be eliminated,
especially the one referring to the appointment of the supervisor. I am of the opinion
that be should be appointed by the Board
of Grain Commissioners. If the Government
want control, let us have a man appointed

APRIL 20, 1939
by the Government on the recommendation
of that board. Whatever happens, we should
flot allow an outside organization ta grow Up.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: In speaking of options
the honourable gentleman referred to Winnipeg' I want to ask himi if hie can tell the
buse, first, if it is not a fact that aur Winnipeg market is largely used for hedging aperations, and, second, to what extent that
hedging is done by the Chicago grain men.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I prefer that. my honaurable friend shauld ask that question in coinmittee. I liappen ta know -that the experts
and ather afficers of the Grain Exchange are
here. Let me say as a farmer-praducer that
there is a difference of opinion, but the
general feeling is that the Grain Exchange
draws a great deal of business framn ahl over
the warld. It is one of the mast extensive
exchanges in the world for hedging purpases.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: There is in that connection another paint ta which I shauld like
ta call attention. When we ariginally guaranteed a price of eighty-seven and a haîf cents
on wlieat, one af the Chicago grain men told
nie it gave themn the greatest romp they ever
had, because they had a guaranteed price at
Winnipeg and an open price everywhere else in
the worlýd. It was more or less common knowledge that members of the Chicago Exchange
made millions out of it. I arn of the opinion
that if wc are going to guaraiitee the price of
wbeat we should keep aur liands pretty well
on this option market; otlierwise there will be
an oppartunity far grain men abraad ta use
the guarantee of this cauntry as a safeguard
for their aperatians. I should like to have
that fact brouglit out when we are in the
cammittee, because, off-hand, 1 arn af the
opinion we shauld take even further control
than this Bill proposes.
Han. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
senators, 1 wish ta mnake only a few remarks
upon this matter. As was said by the honourable senator framn Winnipeg-South Centre
(Hon. Mr. Haig), most people in Western
Canada are agreed that dealing in grain
futures should flot be abalished. When we
were grawing a gaod deal of wheat in the
pravince af Alberta it was a cammon habit
with men who produced 20,000 or 25,000
bushels ta have it hauled right fromn the
tbresher ta the elevator and ta seli it, because
tliey did nat want ta pay starage. If a farmer
thouglit the price was low, and wauld rise,
he would nat store his wheat and pay s0
mucli a montli for the starage, but instead hie
would seIl for cash and buy futures, witli a
view ta making the difference between the
71408-13;

195

price lie gat and the future price. If there
was a drap, hie suýffered onlytlie saine loss that
lie would bave had if lie had beld lis grain,
less what lie miglit have paid ta the elevator.
Tliere lias been a gaod deal af tliat kind af
buying and selling especially 'by tlie large
grain growers in the West.
Grain dealers*tell us, of course, that tliey
cauld not continue on the market day after
day, buying grain that could not be delivered
for some days, or perhaps a longer period,
unless tliey liad tlie privilege of liedging by
making sales, sa that if there was a sharp
drap in price tbey would not lose as mucli as
if they had waited until tliey got delivery af
the grain before they sold it.
The hon-ouraible senatar f.romn Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) stated that when there
is a fixed price for grain, outside grain
speculators take advantage of it. I think that
is quite true, tliough I cannot speak about the
matter definitely, for il arn not as conversant
witli the grain trade as perhaps 1 ouglit to be.
This Bill is brouglit in ta remedy that situation, to provide for the appointment of an
oficer who will have power ta prevent buying
and selling of futures or ta limit sucli transactions. In short, lie will he able ta &tep in and
protect the market.
As was stated by the honourwble senator
fromn Winnipeg Southi-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig),
the Banking and Commerce Committee will
have the advantage ai hearing representatives
of the grain trade and ai grain praducers.
AIl these matters can very well be dealt with
in the committee.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.
FARIMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Senate resumed fromi yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 86, an Act ta amend The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: My riglit
lionourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meiglien) happened to ibe out of the Cliamber
yesterday afternoon when, I moved second
readîng af this Bull, and I was given ta understand that lie would like ta express bis view
as ta the Farmers' Creditars Arrangement Act
being continued in Manitoba as it is in
Saskatcliewan and Alberta. As I explained
yesterday, there was a difference of opinion
-between tlie tbwo Chambers last session with
respect ta the bill that camne fiefore us then,
and aiter a conference ai managers there was
an agreement upon the measure in the form

196

SENATE

in w'hich if was passed. This Bill seeks f0
repeal section 9 of lasf year's statute. That
section reads:
No proposa] shall be received in either of the
provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia
later than the thirtieth day of June, 1939, nor
in any other province exeept the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta later than the
thirty-first day of December, 1938: Provided
that this subsection shal] not apply to farmers
wbo are soldier settiers within the meaning
of the Soldier Sefflement Act.
In a]] provinces except -Manifoba, British
Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta the Acf
ceased f0 have effeef as of the 31sf of
December lasf. As f0 Manitoba and British
Columbia, it was providcd that the Acf should
remain in force until the 3Oth of June this
year. No change is sought in that respect so
far as British Columbia is concerned, but this
Bill sceks fo provide that Manitoba, like
Saskatchewan and Alberta, shah] continue
îndefinifely f0 rcceive the benefits thaf accrue
under the Acf. And I presumne benefits do
accrue, since petitions have corne from the
Legislafure of Manitoba and other organizafions in favour of maintenance of flic statute
in tîmaf province.
As iiiy riglif hionourable friend said last
yca', flic Act ivas passed inainly f0 dca] withi
a special situation whîich had ilcvelnped in
flic West, and it probably îîever slîould have
been exîcîîded f0 the otheî' parts of Canada.
So f lus Bill seeks f0 bring us bac-k f0 flic ideal
situîation as visiîalized bv imv riglif honourable
fricnd. in wliici flic Acf will be applicable f0
only flic flrce Prairie Prov inces.
Rigbf Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Iast

Comnions respect ing the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Acf ivas amended here an as to
repeal the Acf. I amn unable f0 sfatc at the

Righft Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHE-N: Yes.W

Finial]y a comproise uvas arrived af whereby
the Acf should continue in force unf il June
30, 1939, in Mlanitoba and British Columbia,
and indefinifcly in Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The Bill was passed on flic basis of that comproimise. In sieh circumastances if is nt very
cncouraging to have another bill corne over
frein flic Comuns this session tu change wliaf
uvas agrecîl upon by compromise.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND.

Although 1 sponsored this Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, I have frankly adrnitted
in the House on more than one occasion
thfat 1 think the legisiafion was wrong in toto.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Western Provinces?

Even for the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Even for the
West. In the three Prairie Provinces there
wvas more excuse for the operation of this
Act than in any other part of the country,
because ouf there misfortune, with consequent
inability to discharge debt, was more prevalent. But now that we 'have had sorne
years of experience witb the Act, I arn of
opinion that we could have got through by
miere negotiation of new agreements between
debtor and creditor, as ive had done for yc-ars
and years, and in that way we should have
preserved a morale on the part of the debtor
and a wi]lingness to trust on the part of the
creditor which unfortunately the operation
of this Act bias destroyed. I would support
abolition of the Act everywhere righf now,
as I would have done a year ago. I do not
sec what, good cani possibly be done by continuing it in Manitoba. EverY application
fliat is receiv cd up to the 30tlh of June can be
dealf, wifh, in any event.
1 arn informed, and I will read fromn a lctter
tflic paragraph wl-hich informns me. that large
numbers of letters were sent out, virfually
inv iting farîners to seekHon. Mr. DANDURAN D: Before niy right
hionourable friend rcads that, 1 would ,tate
flic sole justification for this Bill. I shouild
have donc this carlier. If is expressed in just
a fcw lines in a memiorandum wvhich I bav e
liere:
During flic year dissatiafaction lias heem
expresseci in Manitoba that the Act was to be
termninate1 in that province, and representafions bave been received f rom the Ujnited
l'armiers of Manitoba, the Manitoba Co-operatiî e Conference, the Caîîadian Chamber of
ý\griculture. and liotably, from the I'iovîneîaýl
Jegislature.
That i. flic reason wliv flic Govcrminiii lhave
brouglif this Bill before Parliarnent. We arc
serking f0 comiply withi the reque-.f oi the
Provincial L-gislatiire and flic other îit-îîilions fliat I have jîist nanîcd.
MEIGHEN: I dIo flot
Right Hon. .
(houl)t tlîat fhicrc îould be spnra(hic appeals
for tlie continuation of fuis Act froiîi any
province. If we lîad on tlie Statute Book,
for a, long timie a ]aw that lno man nc-ed pay
his debts at aIl. and we later decided to
repeal if. we should no doubt have manv
appeals for ifs continuation; and wc should
ho .oiipiiscîl at soîeni oflice persons whîo.:

APRIL 20, 1939
would send them in. They would do so
because their action would gain them popularity with less fortunate people.
I will read one paragraph from the letter
to which I have referred. I would ask the
House not to demand identity of the writer.
He is a lawyer in Manitoba with an extensive
practice, particularly in the lending business.
He said:
As soon as the Provincial Government had
learned of the repeal of the Act it sent out
more than 12,000 notices advising those who
might wish to apply for debt arrangement to
do so before June 1, 1939.
It should be June 30, I presume.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
authorities?

The provincial

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. He
goes on:
I have been informed by a company which
has more outstanding mortgages and agreements in this province than any other single
companyI know what company is referred to there.
I think it has as many as any three or four
other companies.
-that it has only received two new proposals
since the first of the year.
Those, of course, can be dealt with. Imagine
that result after the sending out of 12,000
letters!
I believe if inquiry was made of the F.C.A.A.
office in Ottawa its records will show a large
decrease in applications filed in this province.
In other words, there has been ample opportunity for filing proposals, and those who
wanted to do so have availed themselves of the
privilege.
I know there is some pet scheme out there
-this is my own language-for establishing a
land court. Apparently the purpose of this
court would be to determine, not what a man
is legally bound to pay, but what he ought
to pay in the opinion of the judge, having
regard to his position, prospects, character of
land, and so forth. I do not know of any
more direct road than that to the disintegration of society. It is a straight road to
industrial anarchy.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I formerly
tried to explain, farming business is not at all
the same as commercial business, which requires bankruptcy machinery.
You cannot
tell what a farmer's prospects are. They may
change within a week or a day. A man who
is bankrupt to-day may be in fair circumstances before long; and a man who is very
well off may meet with sudden misfortune and
become unable to pay his debts, so that under

the principles of bankruptcy he would be
declared a bankrupt.

This situation has been

taken care

of down through the years by

practical common sense, demanded by the
necessities of the occasion, on the part of
creditor and debtor alike. For all the applications which have been dealt with under
this Act, I venture to say there have been
multiplied numbers dealt with privately between debtors and creditors themselves.
Personally, I have had at least twenty, and
not one ever came in under the Act.
What is the use of saying to a man, "You

owe so much money," when you know he
cannot pay it?

If he is the right man to

keep on the land, or as good as can be got,
you make the best deal possible, and he goes

on, with his self-respect saved. But now, if
he has not a great deal of self-respect, if he
is a rather cute fellow, he will say to you:
"You just do this, or I will go before the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement board, or
this new land court, and have them decide
whether I shall pay my debts or not, or how
much of them I shall pay." The whole idea,
principle and moral of this Act is wrong.
You cannot hold civilization together with

laws like this; they will not permit the
machine of civilization to work. I say: Get
rid of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act
throughout Canada. Leave debt arrangements to negotiation between debtor and
creditor, and both will be the better.
What about the good farmer in Manitoba?
What about the industrious, honest fellow?
When he applies for a loan, can he get one?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: No, he cannot get a dollar. This Parliament has virtually
shut and barred the door to the lender in
that province. This Parliament says to him,
in effect, "Don't lend any money there,
because we provide machinery whereby borrowers will not have to pay." Western Canada is to-day struggling under the shadow
of lack of credit, a shadow which, I am almost
ashamed to say, and I regret to say, has been
cast upon it by this Parliament. We are the
persons responsible for bringing about a state
of affairs wherein the old standard of trust
between debtor and creditor is gone. And
so long as we hold this kind of legislation on
the Statute Book it will never return. Will
a banker in Manitoba lend to a farmer? Why
should he? The banks have been engaged
in closing their Western branches. They are
buying bonds of this Federal Government
giving a return of from 2 to 2j per cent.
They are not lending to John Smith, of
Portage Plains, because the Government of
Canada have provided this machinery for
debt adjustment. Let us not misunderstand

SENATE
the situation. That atmiosphere now prevails
over those three Prairie Provinces, and I
have no doubt it prevailed to somne extent in
theouthler pro%-iiieý, tao. util they got rid
of this legisiation. The destruction of mor-ale
is its very worst feature. I fhink I have stili
my syrnpathy for the West. My interest
continues there. It is true I arn not a farrner
with debts, but I have debts too. I have
neyer hiad the least difficulty in handling these
matters myseif. Thousands of others are
in a similar position. What difficuities have
existed have been iargely because of the sword
hanging above everybody-the threat to corne
in under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act, or sorne other of the multitude of dehtextinguishing Acts by which Western administrations scek -to make thernselves popular.
This purchase of popularity at the price of
commercial dishonour is the deadliest poison
with which you cari infect the body politie.
I arn sorry to sec the Gox ernmcnt corne
forward with this measure to extcnd the
operation of this vicious influence, and I arn
going to oppose it out and out. I will support
the Governmcnt withi ail my might if thcy
will bring in a Bill to repeal titis lcgislation,
and I will support thcrn withi ail my might if
they wiil set their faces resoiutely against
evcry provincial Act whicha by destruction of
credit affects the vcry well-.bcing of the wholc
nation.
The
Governiment
alreadv
have
disailowed some of that legisiation, and I have
supportcd them in that dilsallowance; indeed,
eneouraged them before they took action.
I do not know about the poiitics, but 1 do
icnow the moraiity of such legisiation. I do
know the deadiy effeet it has had on our
country.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: The hionourable
leader on this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) made a remark a few moments
ago which shows hie is not famiiiar at ail with
the working of the Act.
He said it was
torrninated in several provinces on the 3lst of
December iast.

R:glut Hon.

Mr. NIEICHEN.

To-day, I understand, there are sufficient
aipplications before the Board of Revicw in
Prince Edward Island to keep thern busy for
the whoic of this year, when, as a matter of
fact, the Act shouid not be operating at ahl
in a province where thore is o necessity for it.
I shouid like to sec this Bill go before a
conîisit tee, where wc cari ascertain from sorne
of the officiais at Ottawa whether thcy know
ativthing about, the administration of the
Act in the provinces. They shouid ho able
to givo us some information which, in my
.jtudgmeot, wouid justify Pariiamcnt in making further arnendmeots to the Act, if not in
repcaiîîg it altogether.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the Act is
repealed in Prince Edward Island. That is,
no oew applications cani be received there.
Hoit. Mr. HUGHES: It is not entirely
aholiied, for there is a ciass of people to,
whoin it applies in ail the provinces-returncd men.
Now, I submit that if the
returned soldiers arc entitied to fcirther consideration the Goveroment of Canada shouid
gix e thcmn that consideration.
This Bihl
tlirows on the country retail merchant the
hulen of hiping the returncd soidier. The
Act should ho wiped out aitogether. I want
to briog that phase of tîte mnatter beforo

APRIL 20, 1939
I have in my pocket a letter complaining
that the administrator will not settle with
him. Last year I was challenged in the press
to prove that they had solicited business.
Another advertisement was issued a few days
before the end of last December, inviting
applications for reduction of debt. In connection with this I have a letter from the
administrator saying he had sharply called
the official to account.
If we do not get an opportunity of securing
this information before the Banking and
Commerce Committee, we shall have to put
a flood of questions on the Order Paper. The
only man who could give us the information
we are seeking is the administrator.
I was in favour of the legislation at first,
as I did not wish to appear partisan, but I
have now come to the conclusion that it is a
pity it was not declared ultra vires like some
other legislation enacted at the time. So far
this legislation has cost $3,000,000. Where is
it going to end? As the right honourable
leader on the other side said, we do not want
the Act. But the Government have encouraged it. The impression seems to prevail
throughout the country that everybody must
get something out of the Government in
some way or other. I do not say this in disparagement of the farmers. They deserve a
good deal of consideration, but undoubtedly
the Act should be handled more intelligently.
I resent the manner in which this Bill
comes before us now. We had a conference
of the managers appointed by both Houses,
and they reached a certain agreement. Then
we got a Bill extending the time for the
operation of the Act in some provinces and
terminating it in others.
The right honourable gentleman spoke of
17,000 circulars being issued in Manitoba. In
Prince Edward Island a man interviewed the
farmers and members of Women's Institutes,
urging them to send in letters saying what
a wonderful Act it had proved to be, and
that it should be continued and even expanded.
Fortunately we have very good boards of
trade in my province, and they sent in strong
resolutions requesting that the Act be discontinued as soon as possible. It should have
been terminated in Prince Edward Island
long ago.
Another thing I do not like is the way
the returned soldiers are dealt with. Last
session we did not get a chance to consider
the matter, but I think it is a mistake to
attempt to justify continuation of the Act in
relation to our returned men. Why should
they come under the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act? They were looked after

199

before. As my honourable friend beside me
(Hon. Mr. Hughes) has said, the Government
should look after our returned men.
In our province big firms like Eaton's and
Simpson's do not give credit to our farmers;
they sell for cash only. As honourable senators will remember, I put a question on the
Order Paper and was informed that one local
firm had 230 cases of composition, and had
to take what was handed out to them.
The Act should be administered with greater
uniformity in the various provinces. At
present there is no uniformity of administration. The Act is not ambiguous, but apparently those in control have the wrong idea
and intention in regard to it. We should
have the administrator before the Banking
and Commerce Committee, where we can get
from him the information that we desire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is one
remark I want to make to my honourable
friend. He seems to think the House of
Commons has broken faith in not standing
by the agreement which was made last year
between the two branches of Parliament.
Of course, an Act can always be amended,
and we are now here with an amendment
which can be accepted or amended. It is
absolutely in our own discretion.
I move second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I will vote for the
second reading if it is understood the Bill will
be referred to a committee. If not, I will vote
against it.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is the Bill to go to

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
think it is only reasonable that we should

Other Bills have been read a second time on
the understanding that they would be sent
to committee. I do not feel like voting
against this Bill, nor do I feel like voting
against those who think that it should be considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill is
presented under a very special condition. It
would not even need to go to Committee of
the Whole. The whole matter is based upon
a demand concerning Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, no; Alberta,

\Vhî:t -mtîhlv appens unde- Ibis Act i that

APRIL 20, 1939
the mortgage companies are protected more
than anybody else. Mortgages, mortgage companies, and if e insurance companies are protected.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And every other
creditor is penalized.
Hon. Mr, HAIG: And everybody else is
penalized.
Now, I amn a farmer on a haif section. There
is a first mortgage of $3,000 on my land. If
there is evidence that t.he land is worth
$2,500, the mortgage is written down to
$2,500 and ail the other debts I owe are wiped
out. The mortgage companies then have on
the land which is mortgaged a farmer who lias
no other debts. But what about the doctor,
the merchant, the implernent man, the banker?
What about every other individual the farmer
owes money to? He is just out of doors.
The farmers get a certain benefit, in a sense,
but the mortgagees are the greatest beneficiaries. The littie merchant, the implement
dealer, the local banker and others are wiped
out. In Manitoba there is an effort to provide that up to the value of the chattels these
people shall be given some rights; but that
is aIl.
I think that when the arnendment of hast
year ivas enacted the Governrnent of Manitoba
did not know about it. When they found it
had been passed they communicated-I do
not know by what means.-with the Debt
Adjiustment Board nppointed by thern and
the board wrote to every farmer in Manitoba
who had ever been before it, telling hima that
if hie wanted to apply for adjustment uinder
the Farmners' Creditors Arrangement Act he
would have to do so before the 3Oth of June
this year.
Last year our crop wvas reasonably good,
but the price was how, and there bias been
sorne clamour from a certain type of farmer
for a renewal or extension of the legishation.
OnIy about five per cent of the farmers are
rnvolved. On the other hand, while people
who lend money on farms are offering very
littie objection to this Bill, you will find that,
as the leader of the opposition bas said. other
people dare not lend money in Manitoba, for
they cannot tell when the Act is going to be
extended again.
In Saskatchewan, at the recent session of
the Legislatuire. an Act was pas.sed providing
that if a farmer had paid a certain amount
on his machinery, the company could not
recover under its lien.
In Manitoba you cannot borrow any money
to-day. I happened to be in the Legishature
there, and members on both sides were bound
that I should not oppose this Bill. It was

pure pohitics, nothing else. They were sure
people in the rural parts of Manitoba would
accuse them of having been negligent in their
duty. But now Manitoba is coming back.
We are going to ask Parliament to give us
an eighty-cent guarantee on wheat.
An Hon. SENATOR: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We are. going to ask it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my
honourable friend is too modest. Why flot
a dollar?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want to be fair.
Some Hon. SENATORSl: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Many people in Manitoba thought the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act would keep the farmer on the land,
but I amn persuaded that it has had exactly
the opposite effeet, and that the Debt Act of
Manitoba bas been more useful. Under it,
when a creditor goes to a farmer who says,
"'You cannot make me pay," the creditor can
say, "But you will owe it." In case after
case the farmer himself bias settled with the
creditor, and, apart from stubborn cases and
cases of non-company lbans, very reasonable
settiernents have been made. I do not think
we need this Act at all in Manitoba. In my
opinion it is a detriment to the province and
is hurting our credit. Instead of passing an
Act like this, we ought to be doing aIl we
can to boister up our credit.
I arn willing that the Bill should get second
reading and go to committec, where the
honourable

senators

from

Prince

Edward

Island can get the information they want.
I must say that we have no such charge in
Manitoba as bas been mentioned. I think that,
by and large, there bas been very rea.sonable
administration of the Act in our province. The
officiais there, under the past and present Governrnents, have been very satisfactory.
Riglit Hon. 'Mr. MEIGIIEN:
I was appealed to by the honourablo leader of the
blusc (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to agreo to
second rcading. on condition that the Bill

as that is understood I will not objeet to

PRIVATE BILLS
THIRD READING

Bill H2, an Act respecting the New Brunswick Railway Company.-Hon. Mr. Robinson.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill G2, an Act to incorporate Universal
Eucozone Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee reports this Bill with one amendment.
The name of one of the directors, appearing
in a previous clause, is inserted in a clause
from which it had been omitted. This amendment does not in any way affect the nature
of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved the third reading of Bill G2.
Hon. Mr. -MeRAE: Honourable senators,
I think this is the first time I have risen
in this House to speak to a Bill emanating
from a committee of which I was a member.
I do it only to express to the House a fear
that I have with respect to this Bill and a
misinterpretation
that
might be placed
upon it.
What is done under this Bill could have
been accomplished under the Companies Act.
The reason given for requesting a special Act
of Parliament was that it was required for
use in foreign countries. The Bill, as I understand it, excepts certain provisions of the
Companies Act.
I would call the attention of honourable
senators to paragraph 4, which says:
The capital stock of the company shal consist
of seven hundred and fifty thousand shares
divided into two hundred and fifty thousand
class "A" shares of five per centum cumulative
preference stock having a par value of ten
dollars for each share and five hundred thousand shares of class "B" stock having no nominal
or par value.
If the no-par-value stock is put at the same
valuation as the preference shares, the capitalization will be $7.500,000. I do not know the
object of the owners of the patent process
involved, but from the set-up of the capital
I should say that they must expect to finance
by way of the sale of shares. What I fear
is that if we pass this Bill and it later becomes
an Act of Parliament, the inference may be
drawn that we have given our approval to
the issue of this capital, about which we know
nothing. The legislation is, no doubt, in
conformity with the Companies Act, and I
may be too suspicious in matters of this
kind, but I submit that a foreigner might
very well regard such an Act as Parliament's
approval of the capital issue.
I only wish to place this view before the
House prior to the final reading of the Bill.

203

APRIL 21, 1939

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill came
before the Committee on Banking and Commerce this morning, and I was informed that
the powers conferred could have been given
under the Companies Act. I had not heard
the reason advanced by my honourable friend
just now for an Act of Parliament being desired rather than letters patent granted by the
Secretary of State.
I wonder what is the .difference between
the action of the promoters of this Bill in
coming to this House and the action of other
promoters in asking for private bills of incorporation. We sometimes complain that the
Secretary of State does not give as close
attention as he should to certain letters patent
that are asked for, though I admit that in
recent years no such complaint has been
voiced by people who have suffered as a
result of subscribing to stock issued under
letters patent. The fact that the company
comes here asking for a Bill has not struck
me as being abnormal, and I wonder if the
power to issue preference stock and common
stock goes beyond what is generally granted
to any company or to men of substance who
under our regulations seek such power. I
will ask from the right honourable gentleman
who has given his services in presenting the
Bill (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) his moral
assurance that the citizens of Canada shall not
suffer under this measure.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have nothing to add. Parliamentary Counsel stated the
legal position exactly to the committee to-day,
and the committee reported the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
REFUND OF FEES

On the notice of motion by Hon. Mr. King:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon Bill K,
intituled an Act to incorporate The Canada
Board of American Missions of The United
Lutheran Church in America, be refunded to
Messrs. Long and Daly, solicitors for the

petitioners, less printing and translation costs.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable sena-

tors, in the absence of my colleague the
honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King), I move this motion standing in his name. I understand that a refund
of fees in connection with religious bills of
this kind is according to precedent.
The motion was agreed to.
71498-14.

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable members, I should like to explain,
perhaps on a question of privilege, though
not necessarily under that heading, a misunderstanding with regard to the vote taken
yesterday on the motion for second reading of
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill. The
Debates of the Senate show that several
honourable senators wished to have the Bill
sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, and not one objection was raised to
sending it there. Unfortunately, during the
debate I had to leave the Chamber, because
of a long-distance call from Prince Edward
Island, with respect to a big event to take
place there on May 18, and I did not know
what the two leaders had agreed to. But I
have asked some of my colleagues on both
sides of the House about the Bill, and it is
clear that we all believed there was only one
way by which we could send it to committee,
and that was by agreeing to second reading.
My colleague here (Hon. Mr. Hughes) said
that if he understood the Bill was not going
to the committee he would vote against the
motion. I took it that the right honourable
leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) had no objection to the Bill being
sent to committee, and this is borne out by
the report of his remarks in Hansard. But
actions speak louder than words. He voted
against second reading, and of course all his
followers -voted the same way. And criticism
is being made of some of us on this side of
the House because our actions also were
apparently inconsistent with our words.
If I had suspected that this Bill was not
going to the Banking and Commerce Committee I should have voted against second reading, and I think my colleague (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) would have done the same. I feel
there is sone sharp practice in the procedure
on these votes. We ought to know what we
are voting for. There was a difference of
understanding about this Bill among members on both sides of the House. I do not
want to be talking one way and voting another:
I want to be consistent. And I am not going
to follov anybody blindly; I intend to use
my own judgment.
Here is another point. If this Bill had
been handled by the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) it would, I think,
have been handled very much better than it
was. Our leader on this side (Hon. Mr.

204

SENATE

Dandurand) has been passing bis around
to be sponsored by different senators. For
instance, hie asked the honourable senator
from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) to take charge
of the Grain Futures Bill. He could very
well have placed the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Bill in the bands of my honourable friend from King's. If that had been
done, the Bill would Iikely have gone to the
Banking and Commerce Committee and there
would have been no confusion in the vote.
1 want to make it quito plain tbat if I had
not understood the Bill was going to be
referred to committee, and if ail the speakers
had not declared themselves in favour of that,
I should have xoted against second reading.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I quit e
understood the bonourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. MacArthur) would vote in favour of
second reading of the Bill in the expectation
that it would be referred to a standing committee.
The only reason I lise is that my bonourable friend bas uscd tbe expression "sharp
practice." I do not know to, wbat he refers.
1 moved second reading of the Bill. Any
shar-pness of action is due to the fact that
my bonourablo friend wvas called to the telephone and did not know wbat had occurred
when the vote was called. 1 amu sorry for
him, but no one is responsible for bis action
but bimiself.
Soin( Hon. SENLATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN:
I
should haveo thought, bonourable senators,
that if there xvas one iniember who would flot
want to rcflect on the fairnes.s or consistency
of others in connection with the Bill it would
bu the senator fromn Prince Edward Island
(Hon. Mr. MdacArthur) who bas just spoken.
The only reason I rise is that bie intimates
I votc(l one way ani spoke another.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUI{:

Oh. no.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The flouse
bas some recollection of wbo did that.
Somec Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr.'MEIGHEN: In response
to an appeal from the honourable leader of
the House. altbough I arn irrevocably opposed
to the measure, I did intimate to bim, as I
bave done on other occasions, that the Bill
migbt be given second reading, and urged
Iiiii to undl<rtakt, to bave it ruferred to comnmittee; but hie went only so far as to say
hie would be in the hands of the flouse.
H,,uj

Ml.

Mi,ARTHIIR.

That did flot satisfy everyone that he himself would move the Bill into committee.
Part of bis argument sbowed he did not sec
any purpose in 50 dealing with the Bill. Consequently, as there was no promise on bebalf
of the Government, I voted against the
motion for second reading.
I arn not finding fault with the leader nf
the Government in any way. 1 merely remind
bim I did offer to settie the matter if he
gave a definite undertaking along the lines
I have indicated.
I will t.ry to help the honourable member
frorn Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur) after this
to understand wbat bue is doin.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Very often. as
my bonourable fricnds readily undcr,.îand,
I have no time to read the Officiai Report of
our debates. AIl I remember of yesterday's
proceedings is that I asked my rigbt honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)-and
it was my last word-whether, after the Bill
went to committee, bie would alter bis opinion
and vote for the third reading.
He said,
"No." That, for me, settled the situation, and
I moved second reading.
SUBMARINE

IN

HALIFAX

HARBOI7R

STATENIENT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Before the
Orders of the Day are called, I desire to refer
to the question the bonourable member frorn
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) asked me
ycsterday. Hie said hie bad been informed
of a dispatcb fromn Halifax concerning the
appearance in the barbour of what seemed to
somebody to be a submarine. I told him
that I knew notbing about the matter. I
find since that yesterday the Minister of
National Defence made this statement in
the other flouse:
Reports were received by naval authorities
at Halifax yesterday f romn a pilot vessel that
officers of the vessel believed that a submarine
had entered Halifax harbour early on Wednesday morning.
Immnediately a most thorough
investigation was conducted by the officers of
the Royal Caniadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. At this time I may tell my honourable
friend that the opinion of the officers is that
the vessel in question %vas not a submarine.
However, as soon as I have further reliable
information I xvill give it imimediately to the
House.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to

Honourable members rnay recail that in the
debate on the Address I suggested we should
explore the condition of the employees who
might be laid off under a co-ordination plan.
I understand that this Bill gives effect to

SEALS BILL
THIRD

READING

FOSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 76. an Act to make provision
for the Seaiing of Royal Instruments:
H1e said: Honourable senators, my right
honourable friend (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meiglien)
asked me yesterday whether this Bill had
been studied by the Department of the Secretary of State, which has the custody of seals
and signets. I have obtained information
from the Department of External Affairs to
the effeet that this Bill was examined closely
by the Under Secretary of State, Mr. Coleman, and by the Department of Justice, and
that it meets with their approvai.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I did make the request refcrred to,
and of course I arn better satisfied when I
know the Under Secretary of State lias approved of the Bill. But I did something else
as weli: I asked the honourable senator frorn
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) to make a study
of the Bill, and to give it ail the time necessary in order to understand it. I did that
because in the littie time at rny disposai I
was unable to understand it, and couid not
see the relation between the expianations and
the Bill. I have not the slightest idea what

205

some parts of the Bill mean, and I do not
think any other member of this honourable
House has.
I arn not at ail fearful that there is anything
sinister about the Bill, but I have a rooted
objection to passing a measure when I do not
know what it means. I have not consuited
the Parliamentary Counsel, but I arn sure
the lionourable senator from Saltcoats lias,
and that Parliamentary Counsel expressed
pretty mucli the same opinion that I have.
The honourabie senator from Saltcoats lias
advised me to-day that lie cannot understand
the Bill, although he spent on it, I think, a
good part of last niglit. My suggestion is
that we should select about four memberssay the honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Copp), who was at one tirne
Secrctary of State, the honourable senator
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) and the
honourable senators from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr, Coté) and Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson)-and have the Secretary of State appear
before them to see if lie can put them in a
position to explain the Bill to this House.
Only one day would be needed for this, and
there is no need for liurry in passing the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would move
that this Order be postponed until Wednesday of next week. By then I may have such
a clear exposition of the meaning of this Bill
as f0 be able to induce my right honourable
friend to endorse it.
I may say I received frorn our Law Clerk
a memorandum stating that lie had no amendments to propose to the Bill. Therefore I
accepted it. I can now boast, perliaps for the
first time in this Chamber, of being on an
equal footing with my right honourabie friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), inasmucli as I,
too, know nothing about this matter.
The debate was adjourned.
DOMINION TRADE AND INDUSTRY
COMMISSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 60, an Act to amend
the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935.

H1e said: Honourable senators, the explanation of this Bill cornes to me frorn the
Minister of Trade and Commerce. It is -as
foilows:
This Bill is the outcome of certain representations made by the late Judge Sedgewick,
the Chairman of the Dominion Trade and
Industry Commission. It includes certain pro.
visions which lie regarded as desirable in the

206

SENATE

public interest and which were omitted from the
original bill. I may say that the Bill was
drafted by the late Chairman himself. The
purpose of the legislation is te make it possible to establish standards in respect of commodities which are not now provided for by
any existing Act of Parliament, and also to
prescribe the words by which the material
content of any commodity shall be represented.
A number of Acts, such as the Food and Drugs
Act, the Canada Grain Act, the Meat and
Canned Foods Act, the Inspection and Sale
Act, et cetera, provide for standards in respect
of certain commodities, but there are many
commodities which cannot be made subject to
standards under any existing legislation. The
Dominion Trade and Industry Commission have
received suggestions for standards for a number
of commodities. This is intended to give power
te deal with such cases.
The purpose of all the Acts referred to as
being concerned with standards is to protect
the public and the health of the public. I quite
understand that the Chairman of the Tariff
Board, to whom was confided the administration of the Trade and Industry Commission
Act, and who was in daily contact with our
producers, would feel that this Bill should b
enacted in order that standards might be fixed
for commodities not already covered by
legislation.
The explanatory note appended to the Bill
gives this further information:
The Dominion Trade and Industry Commission have received suggestions for standards fer
Some cases seem
a number of commodities.
urgent. Further, the knitters of hosiery have
made out a strong case for the desirability of
rules covering the markings of the fibre content
of hosiery, and desire inmediate action.
With these explanations, I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am entirely in favour of this Bill.
I should be prejudiced in favour of any
measure recommended by the late Chairman
of the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission. This Bill is undoubtedly in the public
interest. It seems to me very questionable
whether it is within our powers, but I sincerely
hope it is. The object could not be attained
by any series of provincial statutes.
During the debate on this measure in another
place some comments were made about the
textile industry in general, and complaint was
made that in the hosiery industry in particular
there was an understanding, or some sort of
policy, which encouraged the manufacture of,
or indeed probably restricted manufacture
entirely to, inferior goods, the purpose being
to make more sales because of the very short
life of the product. It was argued that the
industry could easily manufacture ladies'
stockings, for example, in which runs would
not occur, but this would necessarily reduce
sales, and therefore business would suffer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I have received a letter about this from the
secretary of the Primary Textiles Institute.
No member of the Institute has seen me,
but the secretary, whom I have known quite
well for many .years, asks me to quote from
his letter in order to make clear the position
of the textile manufacturers. I will leave out
the first two paragraphs, which are introductory. Then it goes on:
(1) Bill 60 was introduced into the House
of Commons on the initiative and at the request
of the hosiery industry in Canada, which is
ceomprised of about 100 mills producing 7,000,000
dozen pairs of socks and stockings per annum.
These are made from wool, cotton, silk and
rayon.
(2) Early in 1938 the hosiery manufacturers
thought it would be sound if the wording used
to describe the fibre content of hosiery which
entered into commerce in Canada was standardized, the standardized wording to be used if
stamped on the hosiery, tickets, labels, boxes,
signs or advertisements. The problem was discussed with the Dominion Trade and Industry
Commission and as a result a committee was
set up by the manufacturers te report back
to the commission.
(3) In June, 1938, the committee brought
down a report and in November the Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission called a meeting of the manufacturers to discuss the report.
At this time it was thought that action would
be taken in time for spring business for 1939.
Following the November meeting, however, the
industry was informed that the existing legislation did not give power to the Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission to deal with
marking, but that legislation would be prepared
and submitted to the Minister of Trade and
Commerce.
(4) The late Hon. Geo. H. Sedgewick, Chairman of the Commission, prepared Bill 60 and
the hosiery industry urged the Minister to
introduce it into the House as soon as possible,
se that the commission could take action in
time for the fall season of 1939. Considerable
work had still to be done on the proposals as
the wholesalers, retailers and importers had to
be consulted by the commission, which did net
want to undertake this work until the enabling
legislation was through.
(5) Owing to the death of the Hon. Geo. H.
Sedgewick apparently no clear statement of
the origin and the purpose of the Bill was made
and the following extracts from the debate are
from Hansard of April 6:
Page 2864: "Mr. MacInnis: I notice in the
explanatory note, the fourth line from the last,
tlhe stateient, 'Some cases seem urgent.' Then
it refers to the knitters of hosiery having made
out a strong case for the desirability of rules
ceovering the marking of the fibre content of
hosiery and desiring immediate action. This
is a matter on which possibly the honourable
member for the Yukon (Mrs. Black) could
speak with more authority than I, but I am
informed by people who buy and use ladies'
hosiery that there seems te be something
approaching a "racket"-I do not like the
word-in the manufacture of ladies' hosiery;
that the quality is extremely low or bad. I
should like te know if this Bill would apply
te a case of that kind, whether the manufacturers of such goods would be compelled te
produce some better quality than they do now."

APRIL 21, 1939
One can imagine the fine advertisement that
is for Canadian business!
Page 2864: "Mr. Gladstone: The ladies have
a great deal of difficulty and complain a great
deal in regard to the wearing qualities of the
hose manufactured and sold to-day. It must
be annoying as well as very hard on the pocketbook, to find a run in a silk stocking the first
time it is worn, because after that it is totally
useless. I do not know whether this discussion properly comes under this Bill, but it does
seem to me that some department should inquire
into the question whether or not there is any
deliberate effort or agreement on the part of
manufacturers to refrain from producing and
marketing stockings which will not run. I
understand that there is a weave that is runproof, but I believe these stockings are not
readily available in our stores; the tendency
is to sell stockings that will run, in order that
sales may be increased."
Page 2865: "Mrs. Black: There is a runless
stocking; instead of a run you get a little pin
prick of a hole, and I would rather have the
run."
(6) These remarks are in reference to silk
hosiery. In 1938 the milis in Canada produced
about 2,800,000 dozen pairs of women's full
fashioned hosiery made from cocoon silk. Of
this production 515,082 dozen pairs were exported from Canada to 28 different countries.
In other words the relatively small industry in
Canada exported more full fashioned silk
stockings in 1938 than were exported by a
similar industry in any other country. For
example, the United States, with an industry
many times greater than Canada, exported only
382,484 dozen pairs of full fashioned silk hosiery
in 1938 and Great Britain exported only 84,514
dozen pairs of silk hosiery. Canada would not
have this export business if Canadian silk
stockings were not right and to anybody who
knows hosiery it is an acknowledged fact that
Canadian mills produce the finest silk hosiery
made anywhere in the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:
(7) Now, about runs. There is a lockstitch
method of producing hosiery which are described
as. "runless." If a thread breaks, instead of
going into runs the result is a small hole.
Owing to the fact that each stitch has to be
locked the appearance of such stockings when
worn is not as attractive as those produced in
the ordinary way. They were tried out in
Canada, but apparently the women did not want
them because of their appearance and there
was no market for them.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
safety.

Appearance before

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
While a thread of cocoon silk, size for size,
is the strongest textile fibre used for clothing,
any silk stockings must be treated with care.
Fine sheer silk stockings (chiffon) are made in
2, 3 and 4 thread silk and while much more
attractive in appearance are not as strong as
service weight stockings made from 4 to 6
thread silk. To-day women are demanding
more and more the finer thread stockings and
are consequently buying appearance and not
wearing qualities.

207

(8) If any manufacturer was able to produce
a runless silk stocking of equal appearance to
a stocking produced on the ringless three carrier
machines he could work his mill day and night.
On the other hand, stockings are produced in
price ranges and any manufacturer would be
a very bad business man indeed if he did not
produce the best stocking he could in an of
the price ranges demanded by retailers. If a
retailer wants to buy silk stockings from a mill
for $4.90 a dozen, to retail at $7.08 per dozen,
or 59 cents per pair, they will not be of the
quality for which the retailer is prepared to
pay the mill $5.85 per dozen, and which he
retails at $9 per dozen, or 75 cents per pair,
but both stockings will be the best stocking
which can be turned out at the price.
(9) The committee that investigated the situation found nothing wrong with the marking
of silk hosiery produced in Canada, but included
it in their recommendation so as to standardize
such marking.
Under the circumstances we would be greatly
obliged if the facts could be put on record
when Bill 60 appears in the Senate. Of course
the powers to deal with marking will apply
to other commodities besides hosiery and we
believe there are other applications of a similar
nature before the Dominion Trade and Industry
Commission.
Yours faithfully,
Douglas Hallam,
Secretary.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I can testify to the chrrectness of the
statement which has just been read by my
right honourable friend. In recent years
when I have been in Europe I lave heard it
said, in more than one capital, that Canadian
women who cross over to Europe take very
good care before leaving home to have a
supply of Canadian stockings sufficient to
last them while they are abroad. I once
asked some of my relatives why they were
packing so many Canadian stockings into
their trunks. I was told: "It is because they
are the best that can be had. No stockings
that can be found anywhere in Europe are
equal in quality to those obtainable in
Canada."
I think it is well that the Senate should
emphasize the fact that the hosiery industry
in this country is doing good work. And it
is not the only industry of which that can be
said. This fact explains why our exports have
been so buoyant during late years-.I am
making no comparison as to the years. The
fact that we are a large exporting country
is due, I am quite sure, to the quality of the
products manufactured by our industries.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

FARMERS'

CREDITORS
MENT BILL

ARRANGE-

FIRST READING

Hon. J. J. HUGHES introduced Bill 02, an
Act f0 amcnd the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to
infroduce a Bihl
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You do not need
to make any explanation on the first reading.

a few days ago that the statute had terminated
in some of the provinces. That is flot correct,
for it has flot terminatcd in any part of the
country, and cannot be terminated, so long- as
it appîjes to some persons in every province.
While the Acf remaîns as it is, a large part of
the machinery for its administration will
continue in existence, and at considerable
expense, I presume.
The proviso for continuation of the Act
with respect to soldier sottiement was inserted
in the amendmenf made last year, and must
have been due f0 an oversight. If the Government decided that returned men should
receive further consideration than fhey have
yet received, that would be a matter for
which the Government ought f0 bear thc
responsibility and expense. It would seema to
me exceedingly uni ust for the Government
to select any class of people in the various
provinces-say the retail country merchants
in Prince Edward Island for example-to bear
expense on this account. The retail country
merchants already have a difficuit time to
make ends mneet, to carry out their obligations,
and if surely never was the intention of the
Government to compel themn f0 assume special
obligations under this Acf.
The Bill was read the first time.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,

RAINY LAKE WATERSHED EMERGENCY CONTROL BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Biii 72, an Act to carry into effect the provisions of the Convention of the 15th September, 1938, providing for emergency regulation
of the level of Rainy Lake and of the level of
other boundary waters in the Rainy Lake
watershed.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Duff in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Honourable senators, I should like to asi for some information
of the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) before we go into Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We are already
in Committee.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I was not here when
the House was previously in Committee on
this Bill, or I should have put my question
then. I am not acquainted with the commission whieh has charge of raising the waters
of Rainy lake. The watershed of that lake,
in connection with the Winnipeg river, is the
source of supply for electrie energy throughout the province of Manitoba and sections
far more distant. They depend upon Rainy
lake, Rainy river, the Lake of the Woods and
the Winnipeg river. I should like to ask if
the Government have taken any steps to consult the province of Manitoba with a view
to ascertaining whether that province's interests will be affected in any way by the Bill.
It seems to ie that if they are to be affected
at all, the province should have been notified
that the Bill was being brought down.
It is for want of information that I am asking the question. I regret that I have no
technical knowledge whatever in the matter,
nor am I acquainted with the commission
which had charge of raising the waters of Rainy
lake. Perhaps the honourable leader is an
expert on the raising of water levels and may
be able to assuage my alarm.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will permit the Committee to be
seized of the Bill, I shall give him an explanatien.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

On section 2-interpretation:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, it will be remembered that when we
were in Committee on this Bill last week the
right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) asked me for
some precise information. I have here an
answer, which would partly cover the question
just put by the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans), but
before reading the answer I may tell my
honourable friend from Winnipeg that, as I
stated to the House on moving second reading
of the Bill, the provinces of Ontario and
Manitoba have been consulted and have agreed
to the convention going into effect.
In response to the inquiry of the right
honouraible leader on the other side, I will read
the memorandum I have received from the
Department of External Affairs:
In the debate, as reported in Senate Debates,
April 20, 1939, pages 214, 215 and 216, there

seems to be a misunderstanding as to the need
for this measure and as te the position of the
Lake of the Woods Control Board.
The first question is, why could net the
emergency control of the Rainy lake watershed
have been effected under the general authority
of the International Joint Commission?
Senator Meighen seemed to have been under
the impression that the International Joiet
Commission has a general authority to control
boundary waters.
If that assumption were
justified, there would, of course, be no need for
the present convention or for the legislation.
The International Joint Commission derives
its authority froin the Boundary Waters Treaty.
That treaty does not give te the commission
any general power of control over boundary
waters or over the other waters subject to
its jurisdiction, such as waters crossing the
boundary, and to some extent waters flowing
from boundary waters. The authority of the
International Joint Commission is limited to
the approval of obstructions and diversions of
boundary waters affecting the natural level or
flow of boundary waters on the other side of
the international boundary line, and to the
approval of dams or other obstructions in waters
flowing from boundary waters or in waters at a
lower level than the boundary in rivers flowing
across the boundary, the effect of which would
be to raise the natural level of waters on the
other side of the boundary line.
Practically speaking, the International Joint
Commission is concerned with the approval of
dams and other works which, if constructed,
would affect water levels on the other side of
the boundary line. A limited measure of control is sometimes effected by incorporating provisions for control as conditions in the order
of approval. For example, in the Lake Champlain region, an important measure of control
over the levels of the lake and of the upper
reaches of the Richelieu river was effected by
incorporating it in the order of the commission
approving the construction and operation of the
Friar's Island dam. Apart, however, from such
limited measures of control. the commission has
no general authority to control boundary waters
and has no power te deal with problems of
emergency control arising out of flood conditions.

211

APRIL 24, 1939
The only way in which emergency control, and
especially flood control, can be effected in
boundary waters is by the conclusion of a new
convention, together with appropriate legislation.
The other question was, why the Lake of the
Woods Control Board was not the proper
authority to deal with this matter.
Honourable senators will remember that it
was on this question I moved last Thursday
that the Committee report progress, so that
in the meantime I might procure an answer
for the right honourable leader opposite.
There are two Lake of the Woods boards.
The Canadian board controls the levels of the
Lake within a given range, under the authority
of the Lake of the Woods Convention, but
The international
without any restriction.
board controls the regulation of the levels when
they fall below or rise above given elevations.
The international board is, in turn, subject to
the International Joint Commission, which has
to deal with any cases in which the board fails
to reaeh agreement.
Both of these boards are dealing with the
Lake of the Woods. They both act under
authority conferred upon them by the Lake
of the Woods Convention. Neither board has
any authority whatsoever to deal with any of
the waters of the Rainy lake watershed as such.
It is true that the waters of the Rainy lake
watershed ultimately flow through Rainy river
into the Lake of the Woods and thereupon become subject to these two boards. Neither
board, however, has any authority whatsoever
to deal with either the Fort Frances or the
Kettle Falls dams. Further, the Lake of the
Woods Convention itself makes no provision
for the exercise of any control over the Rainy
lake watershed.
In order to enable either of the boards to
exercise any authority within the Rainy lake
watershed, a new convention and new legislation would be needed. Bearing in mind that
the Canadian board would be entirely unsuitable for the present problem and that the
International Lake of the Woods Board is itself
subject to the general authority of the commission, it would appear to be more appropriate
to invest the commission itself with authority
to deal with the Rainy lake watershed. Presumably, the commission will in this, as in all
other instances in which it has acted, work
through the medium of a board. The ordinary
practice of the commission would be to hold
the necessary hearings, formulate the necessary
policy, embodying it in an order, and provide
in the order for its actual working out through
the medium of a board, subject, ultimately, to
the supervision of the commission.
It may with some confidence be expected that
the commission wilî ensure a close co-operation
between the activities of any board that may
be dealing with problems in the Rainy lake
and the international board which is charged
with responsibility during emergency conditions
in the Lake of the Woods.
I would suggest that after the Bill is reported it be put down to be read a third time
to-morrow. Then the right honourable gentleman will have an opportunity of perusing
this explanation.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.

On section 4-commission to determine
existence of emergency conditions and adopt
measures of control:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A slight amendment is necessary. The Law Clerk suggests
the word "that" be added at the commencement of the eighth line.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move that clause
4 be amended by adding the word "that" at
the beginning of the eighth line. The concluding sentence will then read: "in the event
that the commission shall determine that
such emergency conditions exist."
The amendment was agreed to.
Section 4 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 5 and 6 were agreed to.
On section 7-measures
binding:

of control to be

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Law Clerk
also suggests a slight amendment to this
section by the striking out of "all processes"
in line 30 and the substituting of "every process." In order that the other House may be
seized of the reason for the change, I may explain that the word "process" can be pluralized,
but in legal proceedings the plural and singular
are the same, as is the case in "counsel." The
expressions, "The process of the court" and
"the court's process" have for long been familiar expressions to barristers, and there is good
authority for the use of "process" for any
or all of the proceedings of a court.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move that we
amend clause 7 by striking from the thirtieth
line the words "all processes" and substituting
therefor the words "every process."
The amendment was agreed to.
Section 7 as amended was agreed to.
Section 8 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall I report the Bill?
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Can the honourable
leader of the Government give the House the
names of the gentlemen who now compose
the International Joint Commission?

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
read the explanation and am glad to say it is
entirely satisfactory. I understand it thoroughly. There is no need to have it repeated.
for it is concise and clear. I only make this
suggestion.
The International Joint Commission will have to act in respect of Rainy
lake through a board. Rainy lake is close to
and in the ver same watershed as the Lake
of the Woods, and, as is the case with the
Lake of the Woods control, there will be
power to act only after the level of the water
rises to a certain height or falls below a certain heigtt. Therefore the commission would
be very well advised to utilize the same international board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN

NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend
The Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act,
1933.
He said: Honourable senators, on the 7th
of last Mareh I had occasion to speak of the
fate of railway employees who would be the
victims of co-operation in any abandonment
of lines by the two railways under the Act
of 1933. And I said at that time that we
should do well to consider, in the Special
Railway Committee which was about to be
revived, the desirability of examining into
means of assisting these employees. I went
on to say:
There was in Washington, in 1936, I think
a meeting of the carriers and the employees
for the purpose of trying to alleviate the situ-

APRIL 25, 1939
ation of laid-off employees, and a solution was
reached which I believe was satisfactory to
both sides. But it strikes me that if something
is done which would result in the laying off of
a large number of employees, the Government
would be interested in seeing that they did not
fall back on the State for relief.
I had prefaced that statement by declaring:
There is another matter, also of very considerable import, which wereferring to the committee to be revived-could examine, and which would call for an
amendment to the Act of 1933.
The Bill I am now presenting is on all
fours with the suggestion I made on the 7th
of March last, that in view of the proposed
abandonment of lines something should be
done for the laid-off employees.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me for a moment? I have
not the Bill on my file, and I understand three
or four other members are without a copy.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is Bill 12 of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It will be
noticed that I said the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act of 1933 might well be
amended. I added:
It is a matter which was but incidentally
mentioned in the Actof 1933
-concerning the unemployment resulting from
alterations in the whole system. It would be
for us to try to see if we could not induce
the Government to examine into the question
6f sharing with the Canadian National and
the Canadian Pacifie Railway in compensating
the employees laid off.
This Bill is substantially on the lines of
the agreement between the carriers and the
employees signed at Washington in May, 1936.
In order that honourable members may
fully understand the variations between this
Bill and the Washington agreement I would
ask, leave to put the agreement on Hansard.
This is the Washington Agreement:
Agreement of May, 1936, Washington, D.C.
This agreement is entered into between the
carriers listed and defined in Appendices "A,"
"B" and "C" attached hereto and made a part
hereof, represented by the duly authorized Joint
Conference Committee signatory hereto, as party
of the first part, and the employees of said
carriers, represented by the organizations signatory hereto by their respective duly authorized
executives, as party of the second part. and,
so far as necessary to carry out the provisions
hereof is also to be construed as a separate

213'

agreement by and between and in behalf of
each of said carriers and its employees who
are now or may hereafter be represented by
any of said organizations which now has (or
may hereafter have during the life of this agreement) an agreement with such carrier concerning rates of pay, rules or working conditions.
The signatories hereto, having been respectively duly authorized as aforesaid to negotiate
to a conclusion certain pending issues concerning the treatment of employees who may
be affected by co-ordination as hereina.fter
defined, hereby agree:
Section 1. That the fundamental scope and
purpose of this agreement is to provide for
allowances to defined employees affected by coordination as hereinafter defined, and it is the
intent that the provisions of this agreement
are to be restricted to those changes in employment in the railroad industry solely due to and
resulting from such co-ordination. Therefore,
the parties hereto understand and agree that
fluctuations, rises ard falls and changes in
volume or character of employment brought
about solely by other causes are not within the
contemplation of the parties hereto, or covered
by or intended to be covered by this agreement.
Section 2 (a). The term "co-ordination" as
used herein means joint action by two or more
carriers whereby they unify, consolidate, merge
or pool in whole or in part their separate railroad facilities or any of the operations or services previously performed by them through
such separate facilities.
(b) The term "carrier" as used herein when
it refers to other than parties to this agreement
means any carrier subject to the provisions
of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act;
when it refers to a party to this agreement
it means any company or system listed and
described in appendices A, B or C as a single
carrier party to this agreement.
(c) The term. "time of co-ordination" as used
herein includes the period following the effective
date of a co-ordination during whieh changes
consequent upon co-ordination are being made
effective; as applying to a particular employee
it means the date in said period when that
employee is first adversely affected as a result
of said co-ordination.
Section 3 (a). The provisions of this agreement shall be effective and shall be applied
whenever two or more carriers parties hereto
undertake a co-ordination; and it is understood
that if a carrier or carriers parties hereto
undertake a co-ordination with a carrier or
carriers not parties hereto, such co-ordination
will be made only upon the basis of an agreement approved by all of the carriers parties
thereto and all of the organizations of employees
involved (parties hereto) of all of the carriers
concerned. No co-ordination involving classes
of employees not represented by any of the
organizations parties hereto shall be undertaken
by the carriers parties hereto except in accord
with the provisions of this agreement or agreements arising hereunder.
(b) Each carrier listed and established as a
separate carrier for the purposes of this agreement, as provided in Appendices "A," "B" and
"C," shall be regarded as a separate carrier
for the purposes hereof during the life of this
agreement; provided, however, that in the case
of any co-ordination involving two or more
railroad carriers which also involves the Railway Express Agency, Inc., the latter company
shall he treated as a separate carrier with
respect to its operations on each of the railroads
involved.

SENATE

(c) It is definitely understood that the action
of the parties hereto in listing and establishing
as a single carrier any system which comprises
more than one operating company is taken
solely for the purposes of this agreement and
shall not be construed or used by either party
hereto to limit or affect the rights of the other
with respect to matters not falling within the
scope and terms of this agreement.
Section 4. Each carrier contemplating a coordination shall give at least ninety (90) days'
written notice of such intended co-ordination
by posting a notice on bulletin boards convenient to the interested employees of each such
carrier and by sending registered mail notice
to the representatives of such interested employees. Such notice shall contain a full and
adequate statement of the proposed changes to
be effected by such co-ordination, including an
estimate of the number of employees of each
class affected by the intended changes.

intended changes for the purpose of reaching
agreements with respect to the application
thereto of the terms and conditions of this
agreement, shall be agreed upon within ten (10)
days after the receipt of said notice, and conference shall commence within thirty (30) d.ays
from the date of such notice.
Section 5. Each plan of co-ordination which
results in the displacement of employees or

and any assignment of employees made necessary

Then follow the signatures of the participating carriers and the participating employee

With that agreement before them, honourable members will be able to follow clearly
the statement which I now make.
With reference to the proposed Bill, which
has been drafted to provide for the payment
of compensation by the employing company
to railway employees who are deprived of
employment or adversely affected by cooperative measures undertaken by the Canadian National Railway Company and the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company pursuant
to the provisions of the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act, 1933, which draft Bill
follows generally the provisions of the agreement of May, 1936, Washington, D.C., made
between certain carriers and employee organizations (hereinafter referred to as the "Washington Agreement"), it would appear that
the provisions of the proposed Bill differ from
the provisions of the Washington Agreement
in certain respects, briefly referred to as
follows:
(1) The Washington Agreement, which became effective June 18, 1936, continues in
force for five years from said date and con-

tinues in effect thereafter with the privilege
that any carrier or organization party thereto
may then withdraw from the agreement on
one year's notice, and the Washington Agreement is also subject to revision by mutual

agreement at any time on sixty days' notice.
The proposed Bill, if enacted by Parliament,
may be revised or varied only by Parliament itself. It might also be noted that the
Washington Agreement, being a contract, is

binding only on the parties thereto, whereas
the proposed Bill, if enacted, would be binding

on all persons within the jurisdiction of Parliament who are affected thereby.
(2) The Washington Agreement contemplates a voluntary co-ordination undertaken
by two or more carriers and involving classes
of employees represented by the organizations parties thereto. The proposed Bill provides for co-operative measures, plans or
arrangements agreed to by the National Company and the Pacifie Company or settled upon
or made in consequence of an order of an
arbitral tribunal pursuant to the provisions
of the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act, 1933.

(3) The Washington Agreement (section 4)
provides that each carrier contemplating

a

co-ordination shall give at least ninety days'
written notice to the interested employees for
the purpose of holding a conference between
the interested parties, and reaching an agree-

ment, if possible, with respect to the application of the terms of the agreement. The
proposed Bill omits this provision, for the
reason that notice of the intended change
would delay the effective date of the cooperative measure and would not add to the
employee benefits provided for in the proposed Bill, and would in fact hamper the company in dealing with the matter.
(4) The Washington Agreement (section 5)
provides that each plan of co-ordination which
results in the displacement of employees or
rearrangement of forces shall provide for the
selection of forces from employees of al the
carriers involved, on bases accepted as

appropriate for application in the partieular
case. The proposed Bill omits this provision,
as the National Company and the Pacifie
Company are directed by section 16 (1) of the
Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act, 1933,
to endeavour to provide by negotiation with
the representatives of the employees affected
for a fair and reasonable apportionment as
between the employees of National Railways
and Pacifie Railway, respectively, of such employment as may be incidental to the operation of the co-operative measure.
(5) The Washington Agreement and the
proposed Bill contain similar provisions relating to compensation to any employee who
is continued in service, and who is displaced
(demoted) as a result of a co-operative
measure, by giving such employee a guaranteed monthly income for five years equal to
the average monthly income received by him
during the last twelve months of his employment prior to the co-operative measure,
and in addition such employee is entitled to
receive compensation for time worked in
excess of his average monthly time during said
twelve-month period. The proposed Bill contains a provision not found in the Washington Agreement to the effect that at the end
of each year there shall be made a recapitulation of the total compensation received by
employees in receipt of displacement allowances, and the necessary adjustment shall be
made so that no employee entitled to receive
a displacement allowance shall by reason
thereof be entitled to receive compensation
in respect to his employment during any such
year greater than the total compensation paid
to him during the said twelve-month period.

APRIL 25, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If the Canadian
National Railways had not been a government-owned railway, and we had not previously legislated with respect to co-operation,
would this Parliament have had the power,
allegedly, to require the Canadian Pacifie
Railway to pay its employees gratuities of
this sort?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think the
Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act provides for similar legislation in the case of
employees; and it may be that the Railway
Act-which I have not before me, but shall
look at-provides for special treatment to be
accorded to railway employees who are displaced through some joint agreement and who
must transfer their homes to another railway
section or another part of the country. I
think the principle contained in this Bill is
on all fours with the principle to be found in
the Act of 1933, which, I have a vague impression, is based on the Railway Act. I shall
look at that Act and answer my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is the Bill designed to be retroactive?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
will it take effect?

No.
From what day

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is simply for
future action. after the sanction of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then probably
there is no information as to how many
employees will be displaced, and what is going
to be the cost to the railway company. In
the case of the Canadian Pacifie Railway it
is probably the railway that pays; in the case
of the Canadian National it is the taxpayer.
I was wondering whether any thought had
been given to the possibility of reducing the
retirement age of railway employees. I think
it is now sixty-five. If it were reduced by
five years, or even by ten years, the older
men would go off with a pension-I do not
think there is a contributory pension in either
case-and the younger men would continue
in their employment. I am beginning to come
slowly to the conclusion that we should give
some attention to the younger men who are
bringing up families. The other day I met a
man with fifteen years' service who had been
laid off. He has a wife and a young family,
and in discussing the matter with me was
very bitter on the ground that in all this
legislation the senior men are protected and
preferred. It occurred to me that the railway
might consider reducing the retirement age so
that employees with thirty years' service might
go on pension at age sixty, or even before, and
vacancies might be created at the top for

219

the benefit of the younger men who are
raising families and perhaps are now entitled
to more consideration than the older men.
Furthermore, I may say from the political
point of view that, as I am informed, a very
large number of young men are going off,
and that their votes are more valuable than
those of the older employees. I suggest that
for the politicians. We used to be confronted
by a solid body of railway men. To-day
there is a rift, and with respect to voting
power these young men become very important.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am somewhat
scandalized at the allusion my honourable
friend makes to the voting power of a certain
class of employees.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I had hoped, of
course, it would be heard in another place
rather than here.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why should
the railway employees be privileged? When
a man or a number of men working in a
large industry are laid off-and I know of
many who have been laid off in Montreal
after twenty years of service-why should
they receive less consideration than railway
employees?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I try to get this
question clear? Do we understand that this
Washington Agreement is the result of legislation in the United States? It is merely
an agreement between the employees and
the railway companies.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the carriers,
yes.
Answering my honourable friend from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), I may say that this
matter has been discussed from all angles,
and I have heard it stated before our Railway Committee that men who have been in
railway service for a number of years and
are then laid off are at a great disadvantage
as compared with other workers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because in their
work they have been following a certain
groove year after year. I am not weighing
the argument; I am simply stating that I
have heard it. It has also been pointed out
that former bank clerks looking for employment have found themselves handicapped
because for fifteen or twenty years their experience had been restricted to a special kind
of work. I mention this as another example.
My honourable friend may say that such is
the fate of a considerable number of employees. That may be so. I do not intend
to discuss that situation very seriously, because

22()

SENATE

it is perhaps somewhat beyond my own knowledge. I believe it is but a passing phase and
does not require special legislation. In the
present instance, however, we know what the
throwing of men out of employment means
in the way of relief.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am anxious only that the
House should have some understanding of the
step that is now proposed by the Government. This is a most extraordinary measure.
There is nobody in this House, or in any other
House properly and humanly constituted, but
would be pleased if it were possible for the
State adequately to compensate all whose
mode of life, perhaps whose very sustenance of
life, is disturbed, impaired or extinguished
because of economic changes.
Hardships,
numerous, severe and painful not only to the
labouring class, but to all classes, are incident
to economic movements that pervade and
ahvays will pervade the world. One of the
incidents of a free community is that men
have to stand up to these visitations of fate
and cope with them to the best of their
ability. It is quite possible under other forms
of government, such as Fascisrm or dictatorship, to take care of this situation by directing people to other occupations, by directing
payment by the employers to these people,
and generally by telling everybody everywhere
what ie must do. Under a system of that
kind you can, no doubt, take care of these
consequential penalties which visit from time
to time vast sections of people. But no country that I know of under free government
has ever undertaken that task in the history
of the world. The Government are not in
any fair or general way undertaking that task
bere. They are only undertaking it in respect
of a certain section. In respect of that section they say, "We are ready to do for you
by legislation what we have never done for
anybody before, and what even the United
States of America"-in the case quoted by
the leader of the Government-"has not
done." What has been done there has been
done privately between employer and employee, but here we are proposing to do it by
legislation.
I should like members of the Government
to consider just where this leads them. I
should like them to distinguish if they can
between the railway employee and the
employee of any other industry. I should
like them to distinguish between the working
class in that section and the working class
in any other section. There was never a
measure of economy taken under free government for the purpose of efficiency. for the
purpose of doing what has to be done in
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

enterprise, that did not carry in its train
difficulties and punishments upon individuals
who had not invited them, and who had
done nothing to deserve them. Never was
such a step taken without such a reaction.
I turn now to inquire why we are undertaking compensation in one particular sphere.
I fancy it is just for the same reason that
the railways in the United States were constrained to do so through negotiation with
their employees, namely, that this particular
branch of labour is highly organized and controls a powerful vote. It controls a powerful
vote, influencing the Government, here; it
exercises a vast economic power, because of
the strike, in the United States. There is the
rcason. I think the leader of the Government
follows me.
Was ever a terminal altered or abandoned
where many classes of people did not sufferwhere labour did not suffer first, where shopkeepers did not suffer, where lawyers and
doctors did not have to give up and go elsewhere, abandoning everything they possessed,
or where those who had made investments on
the strength of their faith in the future of
that terminal did not have to lose all?
Go into any sphere of economy. Take a
great industry. A new mechanisrm is discovered which displaces labour. Under free
government, economic forces conmpel an industry to resort to that mechanism. It may be
donc reluctantly, but the economic forces
compelling it to be done are irresistible. Competition compels it. What is the result?
Whole sections of labour are displaced and
miust find some other way to make a living;
and when whole sections of labour are displaced, those who depend for their livelihood
upon that labour are likewise displaced.
In such instances did any Government ever
come along and say, "We will compensate
y ou"? But, if this legislation is passed, will
our Government ever again be able to refuse
compensation to people in such a position?
So far as I know. this is the first time that
the principle embodied in this measure bas
been introduced in a free country. Are the
Governrnent prepared to apply that principle
to the extent of granting equal rights with
respect to it to all classes throughout our
broad Dominion? What comes within the
compelling power of one sheltered class of
occupation will also come within the compelling power of other classes. Are the Government prepared to extend this bounty over
the whole field of industry and social activity?
If not, they are never going to be able to
give a satisfactory answer to other classes.
The step taken in this measure leads into
territory where pitfalls will abound. I do not
know that if the principle of this Bill were

APRIL 25, 193921
applied to industry in general there would be
objection from any quarter except one. There
wou]d be objection from the taxpayer. The
taxpayer would be annihilated.
What I want to ask the leader of the Government-and, through the leader, the Administration-to reflect upon, is this. While we
ail should like to, do what this Bill provides,
and while noa doubt gavernments of other
countries would like to do the same thing,
there are certain things which you cannot do
under free government, because you would
flot afterwards he able to exercise the dictatorial powers which would in consequence be
essential. There are thousands of people in
this country, and no doubt elsewhere, who in
one breath are hurling anathema at Fascism
and at dictators and in the next breath are
dernanding the very things which. cannot be
obtained except under Fascism or dictators.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I venture ta
suggest that by this measure the Government
are attemptÀng ta, do in a free community,
where dictatorial power caninot be assumed,
what, pressed to its logical conclusion or even
ta a tolerable conclusion, can Ibe done only
under conditions which would be anathema
ta ail the people of Canada.
A printed copy of this Bill has flot yet been
received by many honourable members. It is
flot on my file, though 1 arn satisfied that I
have had the privilege, which bas not yet
been enjoyed *by others, of seeing the Bill.
In the circumstances I suggest that for this
reason, if for no other, it would be well ta

the meantime the Gavernment will take
cagnizance of what I have tried ta say.

222

SENATE

The primary object of the Bill is to enable
the King's Canadian business to be done
during his absence from England and presence
in Canada. While the Ring is in Canada, the
royal functions in respect of United Kingdom
business will be performed by Councillors of
State acting under the Regency Act, 1937.
They have no legal authority to perform any
royal functions in respect of Canadian business. The Great Seal of the Realm and the
Signets will be kept in England and there
will be no convenient and expeditious way
in which the King can conduct Canadian
business that requires the issuing of a royal
instrument passing under the Great Seal or
Signet.
The same problem will arise if the King
leaves England to visit any other country.
The recent visit to Paris was too short to
require the improvisation of any special
arrangement, but it might well become necessary because of a visit to India, Australia or
South Africa. Accordingly, the Bill makes no
reference to the royal visit, and it is designed
provision for other
to make adequate
comparable contingencies. such as occasions
when the royal functions are being performed
in the United Kingdom by Councillors of
State.
The Bill is drafted upon the assumption
that it is undesirable to pievent the continuation of existing methods whereby the King
performs the royal functions in Canadian
matters. Existing channels of communication
are left undisturbed. This is accomplished
by making the operation section of the Bill,
section 3, enabling and. in form, permissive.
Legal validity is given to any royal instrument issued by the King and passed under
the Great Seal of Canada or under any other
royal seal approved by the King for that
purpose.
Two points may require special consideration. The first is the lack of any limitation
of the statutory provision to special occasions
such as the King's absence from England.
Under the existing law, with one possible exception, the authority to approve and to establish a royal seal is a part of the royal prerogative. Without legislation the use of a
new royal seal, and of the Great Seal of
Canada, or of either, could be authorized by an
Order in Council approved by the King. The
possible exception includes full powers and
instruments of ratification, but does not extend
to any other royal instruments. It would
not, therefore, have been possible to limit
he power given by section 3 of the Bill to
;pecial occasions without creating a statutory
curtailment of an authority which is now
recognized as being within the royal pre-

rogative.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The second point requiring consideration
is the making of permanent provision for
Canadian royal seals for use in Canadian
matters. Under the existing law, subject to
the possible exception already referred to,
the King can authorize a new royal seal for
use in Canadian business. He would, in such
a matter, act upon the advice of his Canadian Ministers. The purpose of making specific
reference to "other royal seais" in section 3,
and of the detailed provisions of section 4, is
to place the existing position upon a statutory
basis; to eliminate the doubt as to the position of full powers and instruments of ratification, and to make provision for the formulation of clear and simple rules with regard
to the conduct of Canadian business requiring
the issuing and sealing of royal instruments,
and for publication of the rules thus formulated. The method adopted, namely, by Order
in Council approved by His Majesty the King.
and based upon an Act of the Parliament of
Canada, appears to conform with the existing
constitutional position.
I do not know whether my right honourable
friend has followed this.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I think
I have followed it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it agreeable
to have the third reading now?

FARMERS'

CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
POINT OF ORDER

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 02, an Act to amend
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
-Hon. Mr. Hughes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
On the first
reading a question arose as to whether the
Bill was in order. J have considered the
point of order and am of opinion that, while
this measure purports to amend the same
Act as Bill 86 was intended to amend, it deals
with a different matter and can properly be
considered by the Senate. It will therefore be
in order for the honourable member from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) to move second
reading.
MOTION

FOR

SECOND

READING

Hon. J. J. HUGHES moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: It will be remembered that last
session the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act was amended so that in some of the
provinces it would terminate on December
31, 1938. Owing, however, to what I think
must have been an oversight, it did not really
terminate in any province on the 31st of
December last, for it still applies to some
persons in every province, namely the returned
men settled on farms who might wish to ask
for consideration under the terms of the
Act. This, I think, is unfortunate. I do not
believe that Parliament really wished to bring
about this state of affairs. The whole machinery or most of the machinery of the Act
would still be kept in existence, at, I presume, considerable expense, for the benefit
of a few persons, even though they might not
want to take advantage of it.
In any event, the Act as it now stands would
appear to me to be very objectionable class
legislation. If the Government and the people
of this country are of opinion'that the soldiers
should receive some further assistance or that
there should be further legislation for their
benefit, the matter might very well be considered, but it should not come under this
Act, and the expense involved should be borne
by the country as a whole. By this Act it is

provided that another class of people, the

223

creditors of the soldiers, shall bear the chief
part of the burden. This appears to me to
be very wrong. For these reasons, and others
that might be mentioned, I think this Bill
should pass.
It is intended under this Bill that the termination of the Act in any province shall
apply, not merely to some particular class,
but to all the people of that province. If the
House passes the second reading of the Bill,
I intend to move that it be sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, for some
reasons which I should like to mention. The
first is that we should then be able to get
some of the officials at Ottawa who administer
the Act to come before the committee and
state whether there is any reason in the world
why the present law should be continued, or
why it should not be amended. But to my
mind there is a more important consideration.
We have been in the habit of getting a report
each year from those in Ottawa who administer
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Last year we received a complete report, but
so far this year we have had only partial
information. According to the report of last
year the expenditure in some of the provinces,
notably Prince Edward Island, appeared to
be out of all reason, and there seemed to be
something wrong somewhere. An answer
given to one of the members of this House
shows that during nine months of last year
the expenditure under the official receivers
was two or three times as great as it had
been for the whole twelve months of the preceding year. We thought-at all events I
thought-that in the year before last we had
reached the peak of expenditure under what
appeared to me to be raids on the public
treasury. But we had not. During the nine
months of last year for which we have received
information, that expenditure was greatly
exceeded. If this is any criterion, the expenditurc under all the other heads will be something enormous. I should like to have some
of the officials who administer the Act at
Ottawa corne before the committee and explain
these things.
I move that this Bill be read a second time.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: I should like to say
to the honourable member that I am quite
in sympathy with- his efforts, but I think he
has gone the wrong way about this matter.
If I understand the Bill, the returned soldier
is the one person left who can ask for relief
under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act. But the Government is the only creditor
of the soldier who bought a farm under the
Soldier Settlement Act.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: What about the
other creditors?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

What others?
Mortgagees.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: If the mortgage is
to be reduced. it must be reduced as against
the Government claim, and, if I am correct
in my view, no official can reduce a claim
hield by the Government.
If the honourable gentleman will amend
his Bill so that the Act will be entirely
abolished. he will have my warmest support.
I shall vote for the second reading of this
Bill anyway, but I do not sec how under
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act the
returned soldier can get any relief as against
the Government. Would the honourable gentleman just reconsider that? I want to assure
him that I am entirely in sympathy with his
idea, but I would suggest that he amend his
Bill to provide for the repeal of the Act.
The Act does not apply to any part of the
country but Alberta and Saskatchewan, except
up to a certain date, and the best thing, it
seems to me, is to repeal it.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am disposed to support
the Bill because of my opposition in toto to
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act after
witnessing its operations for nany years. I
have looked into the Bill, and I think it
proceeds in the right way. I cannot recall
at the moment just what reasons were given
by the present Minister for wanting soldiers
to remain under the Act. The proviso was
inserted at the time of the conference between
the two Houses. I should conceive this to
be the reason. The Government is the mortgage creditor of the returned soldier. There
may of course br other creditors-storekeepers,
doctors and the like-and there likely are in
every case, or nearly every case. It may
be that the Government feels that instead
of having a composition of debts with a
returned soldier of whom it is the creditor,
it should have the matter handled under
quasi-judicial auspices. In fact, I do not
think it can be dealt with directly; I do not
think there is any law to permit it.
The Government already bas made concession after concession. There would net seem
to be any cases where the soldier who should
stay on the land cannot stay there under the
present legislation, and I should think that,
as was argued by the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes), it would net be
worth while to maintain indefinitely in every
province of Canada the whole organization
of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
with all the expense incident thereto, for the
purpose of enabling the Government to deal
with a few returned soldiers.

Yes, deailt
Therefore

Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, many features of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act have
been dealt with, and there
have been
nany technicalities, much circumvention, and
a great deal of talk about votes and everything else in connection with it. A few days
ago, on the motion for second reading of the
bill concerning Manitoba, we were precluded
from getting that measure into committee,
although we thought the whole House, with
the exception perhaps of the honourable
leader on this side, was in faveur of having it
go there. Now a different course is being
taken. I am seconding the motion by my
honourable colleague (Hon. Mr. Hughes).
Many questions will come up in committee,
and information will be secured that will be
beneficial to the Western Provinces when
this matter arises in the future. A few of
us from Prince Edward Island can show, I
think, that there bas been a great deal of
maladministration under the Act, and we
want an opportunity to ask the administrator
some questions. We are convinced that the
replies which will be forthcoming will be
of material benefit to the rest of Canada.
The question has been asked, why returned
soldiers should come under the Act. In our
province there would be net more than three
returned soldiers, perhaps noce. Nevertheless, the Farmers' Creditors Arrangermcnt
Board is perpctuatcd, the registrar and all the
other officials continue in office, rentals have
to be paid, and there is no end to the Act.
The other day it was said that the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act was dead in Prince
Edward Island. I said it was dead, but not
buried. It is carried on just because of the
odd case of a soldier settler coming up. That
sort of thing'should br prevented in all the
provinces. In any event, I think that to get
this Bill to committee and ask a few questions of the administrator will be of material
advantage net only to Prince Edward Island,
but also to the other provinces of the
Dominion. There are many other features
I could touch upon, but I am satisfied that
we are going to carry this motion and have
the Bill referred to committee, as we were
prevented from doing in the case of the other
bill a few days ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
vote for it.

Be sure to

APRIL 26, 1939
Hon. Mr. MacARTIIUR: From the information that wili be given in committee you
ivili understand what is the situation ini Prince
Edward Island, and will be able to make a
comparison between that province and Nova
Scotia. which bas six times our population
and oniy a fraction of our expense under this
Act. Honourable members will be able to
see just how the Act bas been administered
in ail provinces. So far it bias resulted in
an expenditure of about $3,000,000. Judg-es,
who are being paid S9,000 a year, are negiecting their duties and receiving extra pay of
from four to five or six thousand dollars; and
there are men on the boards wbo are being
paid annuaily from four to six thousand and
wbo were neyer worth S1,000 a year. This
whole thing is being perpetuated. It is expensive, and demoralizing to the farmers, as
we shall be able to prove in committee.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Why not repeai it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn obiiged to
move adjournrnent of the debate, in order that
I may learn wbat effect the Bill would bave
upon other provinces. I bave a vague recollection tbat at the conference of managers
for the two Houses, whicb took place iast
session, the representatives of British Columbia
strongiy urged adoption of the proviso that
tbe.Act shouid continue in operation as respects
farmers m-ho are soldier settiers witbin the
meauing of tbe Soidier Settiement Act. Tbis
Bill sech a change in a public Act, and I
wnnt to be informed as to wbether it wouid
bave any effeet upon other provinces, in
order tbat I rnay vote intelligently. I move
ad.journment of the debate.
Tbe Hon. the SPIýAKER: Until to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; I would
say Friday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourabie
members, I only want to urge the bonourable leader of the Governrnent to represent
this to bis colleagues. Tbougb tbey feel there
are adequate reasons for making special provisions with respect to returned soldiers, it is
sureiy not neccssary to maintain ail tbe
macbinery of tbîs Act for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, bear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is notbing
sbort of a scandal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tbe statements
of tbe bonourablie gentlemen to rny left (Hon.
Mr. Hugbes and Hon. Mr. MacArtbur) surprise me. Tbe figures cited by tbem wouid,
I suppose, apply to a period prior to the end
of last ycar, wben the Act waas terminated in
rnost provinces. I can hardiy tbink that tbe

amounts quoted, for salaries and 80 forth,
are stiil being paid out. If tbey were, and if
the oniy means of putting an end to the
situation wvere to vote for this Bill, I
should join with my honourable friendai and
vote for it.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned untii Friday next.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

second reading of Bill 84, an Act to amend
the Dairy Industry Act.
He said: Honourable senators, tbis is a
very smaii arnendment to the Dairy Industry
Act. It reads as follows:
Section fourteen of the Dairy Industry Act
chapter forty-five of the Hevised Statutes oï
Canada, 1927, is arnended by adding thereto
the following subsection:(2) The MUinister may appoint or designate
persons concernedt wiith the production or marketing of a dairy produet or d-airy products
to act on an Advisory Cornrittee to consider
conditions and probiems affecting the dairy
intlostry and to advise the Minister and the
industry with -respect to such condîtions and
problerns. Any person se appointed shaîl .be
repaid ail actual reasonable travelling or other
expenses incurred by hirn in .attending any
Meeting of the cem.rittee authorized by the
Minister.
The purpose of tbi.s amendrnent is to enable
tbe Minister te set up an advisory committee,
composed of representatives of the dairy industry and tbe Department of Agriculture, to
consider conditions and probiems affecting the
industry and to advise with respect to them.
The Minister bias explained eisewbere tbat
dairymen and tbeir associations have suggested tbere should be more intimate contact
between these associations and the department. The dcpartrnent is con.stantly being
faced with interesting problems wbich require
serious attention, and with respect to which
the advice of men intirnately connected witb
the industry is nýecessary. For instance, tbere
is the question of butter and ebeese, which
bas engrossed the minds of ail people interested
in the weif are of tbe industry, and I sbould
say that includes ahl Canadians. That question
will be brougbt directly to our attention tornorrow tbrough a bill which bas corne over
to us front the other House, and we shaîl
then more ciearly see tbe necessity for the
dloser contact to wbicb I bave referred.
Tbis Biil does not seek tbe appointment of
a board. It wouid simpiy facilitate tbe obtaining of advice frorn a smaii comrnittee of
persons interested in problemis arising in the
1
dairy industry.

ITON

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I should like to ask the honourable leader
if it is the intention to send this Bill to
committee?
Unless my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend can give a special reason
for sending it to committee, I should think
it could be dealt with in Committee of the
Whole.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: We already have ten
departments of agriculture in Canada, with
ten sub-departments on the dairy industry, I
presume. I should like to know why we need
an eleventh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is mistaken as to the purport of this
Bill. It does not seek, to create any other
branch in the department. It simply says:
The Minister may appoint or designate persons concerned wi.th the production or marketing of a dairy product or dairy products to
act on an Advisory Committee to consider conditions and problems affecting the dairy industry and to advise the Minister and the industry
with respect to such conditions and probleims.
That is all.

It is very simple.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: And expensive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So far as I can
see, this is an innocuous Bill, from which very
much good may arise.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, the leader of the Government
properly described the Bill as a small one.
It is not onily innocuous. inoffensive and undistinguished, but it is almost negligible. Why
a bill was necessary to enable a Minister to
pay expenses of two or thrce persons to come
here to advise him passes my comprehension.
If he needed to bring them here and the
money was not otherwise provided by Parliament, all he had to do was to include it in the
estimates.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Or take it out of contingency.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
Minister must have a passion for bills. There
is no need whatever for cluttering up the
statutes with a little twopenny-halfpenny
measure like this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps my right
honourable friend is right in saying that the
Minister could, without this Bill, call representatives of the dairy industry to Ottawa for
advice. I am quite sure that many important
problems arise in connection with that industry,
but I have not before me any information as
to why the Minister has brought down the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He will never
have any good reason for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suggest that
we take the second reading now and put the
Bill down for third reading to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Put it right
through now. It does not matter the turn
of a hair.
Hon. DUNCAN MeL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I should like to point out
that this Bill provides for nothing more than
the addition of a short clause to the Dairy
Industry Act. Although the clause is a simple
one, it is of great importance. Probably the
persons whom the Minister wants to bring
under this amendment will be mainly manufacturers of and dealers in butter. The three
large members of this group that come to my
mind are the Burns Company of Calgary, the
Swift Canadian Company and Canada Packers.
There are others in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
but cheese.

Not only butter,

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. there is no
difficulty about cheese. Cheese goes direct to
the ma.rket. It may he kept in Montreal for
a short time, but we neyer accunulate any
large quantity in storage. Snall quantities
of cheese are put up to be cured and aged
for maybe a year. in order that it may become
a somewhat superior article, or one preferred
by people who like plenty of flavour, so to
speak; but the great bulk of Canadian cheese,
once it is cured for ten or a dozen days,
is shipped directlv to Montreal and thence
to the market.
The situation with respect to butter is different. The bulk of the butter is made in the
latter half of May, the month of June and
the first part of July, and the maintenance
of the supply then depends upon how dry
the weather becomes. The concerns I have
mentioned manufacture butter themselves. and
they also buy fromn small creameries. The
smaill creamnery man cannot afford to carry his
butter in storage, but must keep on selling,
and so there generally are a few million
pounds stored in the city of Toronto.
Arrangements were made last year whereby
a large quantity of butter was exported. with
the result that the price rose; and when
spring came and the cows went on the grass,
butter fat brought a higher price to the
farmers than it had brought for several years.
This vear it is the other way around. Large
quantities of butter have been stored; so the
price of butter fat is not very good at the
present time, and it niay fall still lower when

APRIL 26, 1939
the cattie get on the grass. I arn quite sure
that wbat the Minister means to do under this
arnendrnent is to seek advice from manufacturers and shippers of butter and from
creamery men. He would flot want to cati
in ail those people; so lie would ask that
tbey name representatives. The creamery men
would no doubt select from among tbemselves an outstanding man, one who makes
butter- on a small scale and selîs it to the
companies. The Minister might also ask that
there be a representative from the National
Dairy Council, which I believe suggested this
amendment. The advice sought, would lie as
to the best means of clearing ail the butter
out of warehouses and shipping it to the Old
Country fairly early in the season, so as not
to leave enough on band here to depress the
mnarket in the following apring when butter
is being mnade. Tbe man wbu sells creain
mnust make his money in May, June and July.
Witb the present low price of butter fat
fie cannot afford to milk his cows ail winter.
He mnust feed them on grass. Ilt is too expensive to buy feed for his cows in the winter
time.

In the provincial legisiatures each session
a statutory amendrnent bill is passed to take
care of amendments to various statutes-a
bill wbicb is both a curse and a blessing-and
it would cover arnendmcnts of this kind.
The purpose of this short amendment is
merely to give the Minister of Agriculture
autbority to appoint or designate persons to
act on an advisory committee. No doulit lie
will consult the leading men in the industry
and ask them, "Whom are you going to
recommend to represent you?" The man
wlio owns the butter is primarily concerned
in seeing that the different interests get together in order to devise ways and means of
quietly lifting a couple of million pounds of
butter out of storage and so relieving the
situation in the spring.
Very little expense will be involved, because most of the men who serve on the
advisory eomrnittee will flot worry rnucb
about travelling expenses.
The advice of this committee will be valuable, for it will corne from representative men
arnong the butter makers and sellers. The
farmer lias notbing to do with tlie disposition
of the surplus butter. He sirnply seils cream
to tlie crearnery and gets paid every two
weeks. But tlie amount he is paid is trernendously important to birn, and if there is a
large surplus of butter in the warebouses wben
the grass cornes, in the spring, it depresses
the price paid to the farrner.
71498--151

227

Hon. R. B. BORNER: I would suggest to
the honourable member who bas just resurned
bis scat (Hon. Mr. Marshall) that the Minister of Agriculture would do just as mucli to
improve the price of butter if lie called into
consultation sorne of the men wbo to-day are
importing vegetable oiîs. Tbere is a considerable quantity corning in and displacing
our butter. It wouid be equally important to
see tliat wbeat was not shîpped in to deprive
farmers in bis district of a m*arket for their
grain. We bear various reports about surplus
butter. The other day I asked a large crearnery and storage operator: "Who takes the
figures from you? Do you think the Government know bow rnuch butter you are carrying
in storage?"
He answered, "They know
notbing whatever so far as 1 arn concerned.
Wbose interest is being served by announcing there is this surplus butter in storage? 1
do not know wbetber tbere is any surplus.
I am certain tbe Minister would do more
for the dairy industry of this country if lie
would cali in some of tlie tariff tinkers who
bave lowered tbe tariff on vegetable oils, and
restore the tariff, and so secure to the farmer
a better price for bis butter.
Hon, J. A. CALDER: I think sorneone bas
figured out tbat tbe cost wbiie tbe Senate is
sitting is about $100 a minute. We have now
spent fifteen minutes on this Bill-$1,500; and
probabiy a sîmilar expense was incurred in
anotber House.
Suppose we did not pass this Bill, wbat
would happen? Will the lionourable gentleman who bas supported the Bill (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) say that tlie Minister would not
bave power to cati in for advice the persons
referred to? Not at ail. We bave bad a very
interesting discussion about the butter situation,' but that is not the point. Tbe point is,
Wbat is the real necessity for tbis Bill? I
will wager tbat the Minister lias in the estimates ahI tbe rnoney required to carry out
bis wishes, and that no legislation at ahI is
necessary.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: But the Minister
bas nothing to do witb exporting tbe butter.
The exporting is donc by the people who own
it.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: No one
bas any objection to tlie Minister getting
advice; in fact, the more lie gets, the better
I arn suited. It is the wisest tliing for him
Vo do. But to put a Bill tlirough Parliainent
for the purpose is realiy ludicrous. He miglit
as well seek legislation to enabte hira to wear
a green bat. The bonourabie senator from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marsliall) says tliat a certain bill is both a curse and a blessing. This

SENATE

is neithor; it is just waste paper. The Minister bias to baive his estimate, anyway, and
the estimate wili show boir the money 18 to
be used. This Bill cannot have any purpose
at ail exeept to advertise the Minister. It is
just playing with Parliarnent to introduce it.

fulness, that it deserves the gratitude of Canadians.
I compliment the Government on a very
wise measure, and I sincerely hope it will
receive the unanimous approval of this House.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable senators, I have no intention of
opposing this particular Bill. In fact, so far
as I amn concerned, in this individual case, it
has my entire approval, but on this occasion
I cannot refrain from saying a word about
the fact that we have such a Bill presented
to us.
It is only a few years ago that this Chamber,
on motion for second reading, rejected a bill
to make it impossible for any judge to remain
on the Bench after he had reached the age of
seventy-five years. I opposed that measure
as strongly as I could, because I thought
that the principle was entirely wrong and
that no effort should be made to standardize
the age at which judges must retire. For my
part at any rate. I should be much better
pleased if, instead of the present measure,
the Government had decided to present us
with a bill to repeal the whole legislation.
As to this particular Bill, I would point
out what to me seems the terrible danger
that we shall introduce into our legislation
by passing it. No matter how much we may
say, "This is not to be a precedent, this is an
exceptional case," what else can be the result
but continual discrimination between judges
who have reached the age of seventy-five
years?
What else can be the result but
leaving it to the opinion of the Government
of the day whether or not, in the future, a
particular judge shall have a measure of this
sort introduced for his benefit? To one judge
who has reached the age of seventy-five the
Government say, "You must go." To another,
who perhaps is a favourite with the Minister
or his colleagues, they may say, "We will give
you an extension of a year or two." That
may be repeated ad libitum. It seems to me
to be a most dangerous encroachment upon
that highly important principle, independence
of the Bench.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:
To
me it means that, for the future, members
of the Bench who reach the age of seventyfive years will simply retain their positions
at the will of the Government of the day.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, I have no objection to this
Bill. I quite agree with everything that the
right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has said regarding Chief Justice
Duff.

229

But I agree also with the remarks of the&
honourable senator from North York (Hon,
Sir Allen Aylesworth). I think it is of vast
importance that our judges should not in any
way be under the influence of the Government. We are the only country in the world
with a court of final resort that is in. no
way under the influence of any government.
We know from what has occurred lately in
the United States that governments are not
above influencing, or trying to influence, the
courts to carry out their wishes.
I say
we are the only people who have a court
which, to use a common expression, cannot
be "got at" by the Government.
The
Privy Council, the only absolutely independent
judicial body in the world, is now threatened
with extinction so far as relates to appellate
cases from Canada. This Government and
politicians who are dissatisfied with the Privy
Council because it has not decided cases as
they thought they should be decided, are seeking 'low to abolish the right of appeal thereto.
I think we could sustain no greater loss than
that of the Privy Council, no greater loss
than that of an absolutely independent judicial
body. I am in favour of this Bill as far as
the present Chief Justice is concerned, and I
intend to vote for it, but I can see the danger
and the vice of this kind of legislation, as
pointed out by the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth).
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I cannot understand the argument of the
honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton), who says that he sees great
danger in this Bill, but that he is going to
vote for it. I presume, speaking from a
personal point of view, that if there is anybody in this Chamber who appreciated the
kind words of the leader of the opposition with
respect to the Chief Justice of Canada, I am
the man. I, perhaps, should appreciate them
more than anybody else, beeause the Duffs
have always stood together since the time of
Adam.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Nevertheless, we have
always been able to take care of ourselves-Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -and any gentleman who
has such a record in this country as the
Chief Justice has made in the last twenty,
thirty or forty years, has certainly, in my
opinion, arrived at the time when he should
give way to a younger man.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: We hear a great deal
about unemployment and about lawyers who
are not able to make a living-men who have

SENATE

230

perhaps just as bright minds as ny friend
and namesake. We all agree that he has
been a splendid judge and a splendid jurist.
Nobody bas any doubt about that. WhXen I
have sat in this Chamber and have watched
him march in here to give the Royal Assent
to Bills I have always been proud that his
nane was Duff.
Yet I cannot understand why in this
democratie country there should be any
legislation of this kind. This gentleman, with
all his good qualities, will retire with honours.
Nobody bas a word to say against him. He
bas given great service to this country. He
will receive, I presume, a retiring allowance
of one hundred per cent. Surcly, with all the
bright minds there are in the legal profession
in Canada, there must be somibody wxho can
take his place. You will remember that Dr.
Osler said that everybody should retire at the
age of forty.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: At the age of sixty.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I thought it was forty.
At all events, I am willing that the age of
retirement should be extended to seventy-five
years. But, regardless of the good qualities
of the present Chief Justice, against whom I
am not saying a word. I can se no reason
why any Government should introduce legislation entitling anybody, no matter how good
bis mind or how good his record, to a preference, even if he is a member of their own
party, if you want to put it on that basis. I
can mention a dozen men who would be glad
to take Chief Justice Duff's place in the
Suprene Court. Even ny right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) might be
tenpted. I cannot take it myself, but I am
reninded of a story about the tine when the
father-in-law of the honourable gentleman froin
Amherst (Hon. Mr. Rhodes) died. Mr. Pipes
was then Attorney-General of Nova Scotia.
Colin McIsaac and Mr. LeIblanc, who were
inembers of the Executive Council of Nova
Scotia, were called to Halifax by the then
Premier, Honourable George Murray. They
met in the train. They were both anxious as
to who was going to be appointed to the
position of Attorney-General by Mr. Murray.
Mr. Leblanc said, "Well, Colin, what do yo
think about it?" Mr. McIsaac replied: "I
don't know. What do yon tiink?" " Well,"
said Mr. Leblanc, "the lawyers have hiad this
thing long enough; it is time a laynan had
it."1
Sone

Hon. SENATORS:

Oh. oh.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: We cannot have a layman as Chief Justice of Canada. but there
are plenty of men to fill the position, and
I say this legislation is not necessary. Chief
lon.

Mr. DUFF.

Justice Duff bas served his time and has
given value to the country, but I say that
there are hundreds of nien of integrity and
ability who could be appointed, or that one
of the present members of the Court could
be elevated to the position of Chief Justice.
Therefore I am opposed to the legislation.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I brought into this Chamber the
legisiation it is now proposed to amend. We
fixed the age limit of judges at seventy-five
years. We did so because the Supreme Court
had important business before it and there
was need to form a quorum. Sickness prevailed among members of the Bench, and
one mniember who was past eighty years of age
bad refused for a ycar to attend the Court.
Under those circumstances the Minister of
Justice thought it necessary to impose an

age limit.

He proposed that it should be

seventy-five years-or perbaps eighty years.
I do not remember which. The matter was
discussed at the time in both branches of
Parliament and the age limit was fixed at
seventy-five years.
There is much to be said on the question
of amending the Act in a special case, but
I believe that we are to-day facing a situation
which justifies Parliament in making an
amendment.
In answer to my honourable friend who bas
just spoken (Hon. Mr. Duff), I may say that
the present Chief Justice is willing to serve
without any additional remuneration. He is
entitled to retire upon full pension, and is
sinply continuing to give service to the

Minister of Justice think his services are

Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is the pride of
the Duffs. They want to carry on for all tine.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: Honourable senators,
I am not a lawyer. I believe at one time it
was intended that I should b one, but fate
interfered with the wishes of my parents.
Perhaps it is a good thing I didn't become
one-

Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: -because, if I had,
imany people I have known in the meantime

Sone Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Now, I like to be
fair. The Bill before the House provides for
a nian of whom all who have spoken have
spoken favourably. Everything they said may
be true, but to me it was amusing and some-

APRIL 26, 1939
what disgusting that the four gentlemen who
first spoke in favour of this Bill were al
lawyers.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: And they ail agreed
that this thing should be done.
I arn absolutely opposed to the Bill, and
if mine is the only vote to be cast against
if I wjll still cast it. Why do I take that
stand? There are many reasons, but there is
one which is very close to my heart at this
tirne. Lt is this. We had from Western
Canada in the days gone by, when men were
men and flot opportunists, a certain man by
the name of Frank Oliver, a man who in my
humble opinion was the ablest man that ever
crossed the Red river on his way to Ottawa
and the Parliament of Canada. In saying
this I remember that I arn standing in the
presence of others from Western Canada;
and while I want to pay tribute to every
other man who came from there, including
the right honourable leader of the opposition
in this House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), I
give the palm to Frank Oliver over the Siftons
and the Meigbens, or the others, whocver
tbey may be, as the fairest, rnost independent
and most loyal man I ever knew.
There came a day when the people in his
riding declared, by means fair or foui, that
he should no longer represent them. He was
a defeated candidate. I made an effort, a
real effort and a loyal one, on behaif of
my old friend the member for Edmonton,
the past Minister of the Interior, and after
some time lie was appointed to the Railway
Commission. Then there came a day-if my
memory serves me it was the 19th of September-when he was seventy-five years of age.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: On the 19th day of
September of that year he ceased to be a
member of the Railway Commission. Perhaps
I sbould not tell this--or maybe it is better
that, I should tell the whole story.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Sure! Tell it.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: There came a time
when that great man was living down here
in a room on Waverley street, and he did
not have very many friends. Somebody told
me he wa.s there, and I went down and saw
bim in a small room, lying in a very smal
bed which would not hold two persons.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: That man, after al
bis services to Canada, a man who at one
time representýed -the whole province of
Alberta, was left there to do the best he

231

could for himself. To use a rather crude
expression, he was lef t there to "root, hog,
or die." He said to me, "I haven't got a
dollar-I haven't got a cent."
What was he doing? He had bouglit a
little typewriter on credit and was writing
articles for certain newspapers in order to
get a meal ticket. That shows what Canada
was doing for the Hon. Frank Oliver. I said
to him, I will make an effort for you," and
I did. I will flot say to whom I went, for
I was not very well receivcd, but aftcr a
while the party to which 1 belong-and I arn
not very proud of what they did then-gave
him a position whereby he could make a
living and do fairly well.
But wby should he have been treated. in
that way-that man who lef t Winnipeg with
a little press about so high, and wbo, with
bis wife, travelled b-ehind a team of ponies
to Edmonton, Alberta, and later became the
sole member for that province? What had lie
done to be treated in sucli a way by the
Liberal party, whicha was then in power?
And do not forget this. On the day ha left
the Railway Commission a .judge in the province of Quebec who wa.s drawing $15,000 a
year from the Dominion said be was sickI suppose ha bad had a bad night-and ha
retired on $12,000 a .year while the Hon.
Frank Oliver was turned out on tbe roadside.
I will not vote for this kind of stuif, and
nobody on earth. can make me. I arn not
opposed to the gentleman in question; I arn
opposed to the princîple..
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I tbink I shahl have to associate myseif with
tbe non-legal senators who have preceded me.
I do so on the ground of consistency. We
passed legisîntion fixing the retiring age of
judges at seventy-five, and I think we should

saving to the Dominion of Canada of $15,000
a year. Of course, that is not the main purpose of the Bill, which is to provide for
continuation of the services of the Chief Justice of Canada for another three years.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, since my right honourable friend has
spoken a second time, perhaps the House will
pardon me if I say a few words more. I tried
to make it plain, when I spoke before, that I
had no personal reason for opposing this Bill.
In fact, personal reasons would lead me to
take quite the opposite stand. I should like
all the Duffs in Canada and the British Empire to have jobs, whether as chief justices
or senators or members of the House of Commons or in any other position worth while.
The right honourable gentleman is usually
logical, but may I say that he was not very
logical in replying to my honourable friend
from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Molloy), the
bonourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) and the honourable

gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth). He did not refer at all to what
I said.
The Bill does not mention the Chief Justice
or anyone else by name. My contention is
that if we pass it we shall be establishing a
principle, and I say that principle is bad.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: We are not dealing now
with any man's ability, nor with what anyone
has done by way of service to his country.
No one in Canada has a higher appreciation
of the services of my learned namesake than
I have. But what I object to is the fact that
this measure, if passed, will keep him in office
for another three years-against his will, perhaps. As I said a little while ago, all the
Duffs have pride and a lot of conceit, and they
think nobody can do anything as well as
they. That no doubt explains why the Chief
Justice has agreed to bave this -Bill introduced.
Let me show where I sec danger in this
measure. In ten or twenty years' time another
Chief Justice of Canada may have reached
the age of seventy-five and may feel that he
is as able and as young as the present Chief
Justice feels himself to be. If retirement is
forced upon him he may ask, "Why make
fish of one and fowl of another?" and may
quote the present legislation as a precedent.
I repeat that the principle in this Bill is
wrong. Some years ago Parliament passed a
bill setting a retirement age for judges on
the Supreme Court of Canada and the provincial Appeal Courts.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Dominion courts.

Only on

Hon. Mr. DUFF: At any rate, a law was
passed setting a retirement age for judges
on the Supreme Court of Canada. If that law
was good at that time, why not adhere to it
now?
Then, again, I say that there are other men
in this country capable of filling the office of
Chief Justice satisfactorily. Even among the
present members of the Supreme Courtperhaps it is not the right thing to say thisthere may be those who feel that if the Chief
Justice retired they would have an opportunity
for elevation to his position. They have a
right to feel that way. You and I, honourable
senators, would feel just the same if we were in
their place.
We could, as my right honourable friend
suggested, pass a resolution expressing our
appreciation to the Chief Justice for the good
service he has rendered to the country. Instead

71498-16
REVISED
EDITION

234

SENATE

of putting through a measure of this kind, let
us pass a resolution, and an honorarium along
with it if it is felt that the Chief Justice has
not received a sufficiently high salary or recompense for his services. I say that in Canada
there are men who can take any man's place.
If my friend the Chief Justice died to-morrow
morning, somebody would be found to fill
the post left vacant, just as some persons
could be found to replace the honourable
senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) and myself, if we died to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You can
bet on that.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It would take a long time
for them to learn what we know, but they
would eventually. The present Chief Justice
has reached the Biblical limit of three score
years and ten and gone five years beyond it.
If he retired and the Government needed his
advice later on, they could get it. Why should
we pass a Bill, which would establish a principle, for the purpose of continuing the Chief
Justice's term of office, when there are
hundreds of lawyers who could fill his position?
My right honourable friend did not agree with
me in that. Of course, I was trying to be
complimentary to the legal profession, but
certainly there must be some men in that
profession worthy of elevation to the Chief
Justiceship.
Here is another point. In three years' time
a Tory Government may be in power, and the
Liberal Government will lose the opportunity
of appointing the new Chief Justice. I am
too much a partisan to agree to that contingency.
I repeat, honourable members, that I bave
nothing personal against the present Chief
Justice. Quite the contrary. Nor have I anything against any other judge or lawyer. But
I cannot say too often that there is no necessity for the Bill, and its principle is bad.
Let nature take its course, and when a
Supreme Court judge reaches the age of
seventy-five let him retire and make way for
someone else.
The question on the motion

UNEMPLOYMENT AND AGRICULTURAL
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 96, an Act to assist
in the alleviation of Unemployment and
Agricultural Distress.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
in the same form as the Unemployment and
Agricultural Assistance Act, 1938.
In fact,
it is a renewal as to principle, and virtually
as to form, of a measure that we have passed
every year since 1931 or 1932. It contains an
additional provision for financial assistance in
respect of the Youth Training Bill, 1939, which
is still before the other House.
The condition of national unemployment
and agricultural distress is still of such proportions as to make it desirable to continue
assistance towards its alleviation in like manner
as in previous years.
The amounts which may -be spent under
this measure are of course limited to specific
sums to be appropriated under the Supply Bill,
which will come to us later. Section 5 provides
that financial assistance may be granted to
any province for the purpose of assisting it to
pay its share of expenditures incurred under
the provisions of this Bill or of the Youth
Training Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I acbept the word of the
honourable leader that this measure is the
same in every essential feature as the one we
had before us last year. All I rise to say is
that I think a lot of money is being wasted
on this youth training program, which is so
extensively advertised. I am not opposing
youth training, but I say that when you train
a dozen persons for every one who gets a
position you are wasting money. You cannot
justify that. If you train fifty for every one
who seeures employment the thing becomes
grotesque. I understand the Government of
Ontario have adopted a principle of co-operating only to the extent of training two or three
times the number of persons who are obtaining
positions.
One would think that allowed
latitude enough.
It is a sound and sane
principle, which should be adopted and
applied by the Federal Administration. Some
time ago I quoted from the Department of
Labour's own report certain figures which
simply screamed extravagance. I would urge
the Administration to see if they cannot get
some common-sense limitation, such as that
imposed by Ontario, adopted by the other
provnces.

APRIL 26. 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In answer to my
right bonourable friend's reference to the
youtb training movement I rnay say that the
Minister of Labour stated that proposaIs
would be submitted to, Parliament to increase
the usefulness and efficiency of this projeet
by ensuring its continuity over the next few
years, and that on the basis of the existing
federal appropriation an annual sum of
$3,000,000 was 110w availaible under joint
contributions to the Dominion-provincial
youth training program. I think if my rîght
bonourable friend follows the developmnent
of the work he will find it is a most laudable
objeet to take care of tbe training of those
yotung men and fit them for employment.
I bave no special memorandum on this
point, but I know that througbout the
country there seemns to be a considerable
demnand for tbe continuation and strengthening of this legislation. 1 believe we are
moving in the right direction. 1 bave not
now before me the statement of the Minister
of Labour as to the application of the Act,
but I know it bas been cominended generally
in tbe other Huse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Minister
macle some general remarks on behaîf of
this noble work. as no doubt be thinks it is,
but he did not answer the point 1 have raised.
What is the use of training more than two
or three tirnes the number you can put to
work? There bas to be a margin. I was
approving a sensible rule imposed by the
Ontario Government. This is a subjeet which
perbaps might well bave been lef t to the
honourable senator from Peel (Uson. Mr.
Marshall). I bave no0 doubt that, being instructed and informed, he would agree with
what 1 bave said. Does he not tbink the
authorities of Ontario are right in limiting-its
responsibility to two or three times the number who can get work. instead of simply
offering to spend so much rnoney on anybody
who cornes forward, wbether or not there is
afterwards anything at all for him to do,
and thus allowing many more to be trained
than find employment?
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I want to speak on behaif of Manitoba
with reference to this Bill. I must say the
Act is being very well adrninistered in that
province. Many unemployed girls are being
trained in work that such girls mighit hope to

get, such as service as waitresses and, housekeepers-training which our schools should
give, but do not. In Winnipeg the authorities
were very fortunate in getting, in retusn for
pElyment of taxes, the use of a large warebouse that cost 6120,000 to build. There they
have experts fromn the various machine com71498-I6fl

235

panies to train young men to handie and take
care of different kinds of rnachinery. The
work is under the control of the Provincial
Government. and I do not think too many
men are being trained for the number who
can be given employment. Men are also
being trained in forestry camps. The only
trouble is that a sufficient number of young
men and women do not corne forward for
training.
I can speak with some authority about the
beneficial effeets of the training on young
women. Young wornen from seventeen to
twenty years of age, who had had no training
of any kind, wbo did not in fact know how
to set a table, were given four months'
training. I saw these young women last
Christmas. They bave become proficient in
domestic work and dressmaking, and their
happiness shoived that the training was well
worth while. Many of our people in Winnipeg are employing young women so trained
to assist at teas and other functions in their
homes. Their remuneration is moderate. but
it is more than they could have earned when
they were unskilled. Those who are engaged
in the training in rny province are doing
really good work.
As honourable senators are aware, the
province bas to, contribute part of the cost of

mnsist, as the right honourable leader opposite
bas suggested. that no more yoiing men and
women be given training than there is a
possibility of placing in jobs at the end of
their training course.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is ail I
want.
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
miembers, I might say to my right bonourable
friend (Ilight Hon. Mr. Meighen) that I
think Ontario is carrying on this work very
successfully, and that I agree w.ith some of bis
remarks. Personally, I arn not very strong
for education of an ephemeral nature, undertaken with the idea of getting quick results.
So far as agriculture is concerned, I tbink we
madle a great mistake in organizing shortcourse sehools, thinking that in a couple of
afternoons we could teach young men ail they
should know about live stock and the land.
We sbould bave bad a much more effective
system bad we given our boys wben they left
public school-and rnany do flot go mucb
beyond that stage--what I might terra a kind
of scientifie training to start them out not

but with their minds, so to speak. leaning in

SENATE

What, the bonourable senater from Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said
about the training of girls in bis province
applies also te similar training in Ontario.
Some very useful work, has been done in most
of tbe provinces. At a recent conference here
1 bappened to meet a number of men from
Western Canada wbo were cenducting training
classes, and in conversation with tbemi I was
surprised at the progress tbey wvere making.
We are bound to train more persons than
we cao place in jobs, but the very t.raining
tbey get is good discipline for botb mind
and body, and I tbink it will be useful to
tbem. If we corne out of the slougb of
despond witbin a reasonable time, the training
our young inen and women bave received
will enable a larger number to establisb
tbemselx es under improved conditions than
would be the case were tbey witbout any
training at aIl.
Tbese uinernployed yeung people constitute
a grav e probleni. Tbev must not be neglected.
Somietbing nusut be done for tbem. If tbey
bave no wvork te do, tbey must be given an
op)por-tui v to Icaru soinething which will
add to the suni total of their knowledge,' se,
tîxat later on tbicy may be better able to
bold their jobs. But I certainly recognize,
as does every~bod-v else, the difflculty of training twenty-fix e to fily persons and then placing tbenm in crnployment.
Our manufacturers in Ontario bave been
Most generous in their treatrnent of men from
these sebools wvhere tbey gained a certain
amnount of tecbnical knowledge. Tbey were
not meebanies, but rather apprentices, se to
speak. As I say, there bas been very effective
co-operation between the manufacturers and
the authorities in placing tbose men.
Wberevcr you toucb unemployment you

tow arths a large body of citizens if tbey rcqixire lielp. But is tbat tbe case bere? Honourable senalers. tbis Bill deals with tbe
ari,tocracy ef labeur, witb a group of men
tbe mQst higbly îDaid and best pretected. In
Ibis conneclien I would read one paragrapb
fromn the evidence gix en veslerday by Mr.
Clase hiefexe tbe Special Railway Commitlee
of tbis Hoiu.ýe.
He is tbe Asistant Grand

APRIL 26, 1939
Chief Engineer and Dominion Legislative
Representative of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. He quoted from the official statisties of the railways of Canada to
show that the engineers receive on an average
more than $3,200 annually. These are the
highest paid men in the running trades. He
also showed that the average pay of all
workers on the railways is over $1,500 a year.
Hie said:
By taking the average hours worked, i.e.,
2,049, and dividing it by twelve, it will be
found that these passenger engineers work on
an average of 170§ hours per month, and when
reduced to days worked per month, it works
out at an average of approximately 21 days
of eight hours.
The average salary being
$3,205.25, taking into account what has been
set forth above, again bears out our statement
that Professor McDougall's contentions are incorrect when he states, "Passenger engineers
were able to receive wages amounting to
slightly more than $4,000 a year, for a 15-day
month."
I cannot help thinking that Mr. Chase's
statement proves conclusively Professor McDougall's contention. This is what the professor says:
The mileage rate of pay is set with the normal
run in mind; but there are an increasing number of runs on which very high speeds are
made. It is true that the strain of operation
may be greater, but it is highly questionable
that it rises in step with the speed of the
train. Certainly the desirable runs seem to be
those whieh permit a man to go out to the
distant terminal and then to return within the
one working day. At the last Board of Conciliation and Investigation, the railways, in their
introductory statement, brought up a case which
should be quoted in full.
Then he quotes the case. That is Professor
McDougall's practice. In every instance he
quotes cases that have been before either the
Conciliation Board or other tribunals dealing
with the wages of railway men.
In main line service enginemen run only between divisional points. To take another case
for illustration. Engineers running in through
passenger service between Montreal and Brockville in approximately three heurs would earn

their day's pay of 126 actual miles run, and in
addition would receive payments for preparatory
time, initial terminal service and final terminal
delay, representing a total time of approximately
five hours, or 180 miles, which would be $2.07
per hour for the five hours worked. On many
such runs engineers make the round trip in
the same day and so for one calendar day
representing on the basis of the case mentioned
ten hours actual working time receive for the
calendar day pay for two basic days amounting
to a total of $20.70. Under the application
of temporary mileage limitation regulations
adopted at the request of the employees, engineers in this service earn approximately $269
or working ten hours per day on only thirteen
calendar days per month.

It

is not claimed

that this is an average condition. The example,
however, indicates what the present high rates

237

of pay do produce in compensation under the
conditions actually existing in such service as
that mentioned.
That was prior to the beginning of last
year, when there was an addition to the
wages of the men of the 11 per cent which
had been deducted from their salaries by
reason of the depression; and with the addition of that Il per cent their wages would increase to $299 per month. I take Mr. Chase's
contention that this is for two-thirds of the
time,
Now, honourable members, I have dwelt on
this particular point in order to ask whether
honourable members think that these people,
who are paid exceptional wages, protected by
a powerful organization and supported by
American capital, deserve this compassionate
legislation which is now submitted to us.
The second point is this. How do the men
get paid? Well, so far as Canadian National
employees are concerned, they are paid partially by the taxpayers of this country. In
the $54,000,000 of new money that this Government had to put into the National Railways at the end of the year, wages represented
62 per cent. Therefore over $32,000,000 of
the $54,000,000 have gone towards wages of
employees on the Canadian National.
For every $3 the employees received in
wages, $1 came from the taxpayers of Canada.
Is it fair to ask the taxpayers to do better
than that? After all, this Bill has only one
purpose, and that is to relieve the railway
employees and increase the burden on the
taxpayers throughout the country. How many
workers are there in Canada who earn, not
$3,200 a year, but $1,500 a year? How many
of the ordinary workers in our country get
$5 for every working day? Yet these are
the people who had to furnish the third dollar
to make up the full wages of the best paid
workmen in the country. Is it reasonable?
What does that mean in my province, where
the ordinary workman does not earn more
than half of $1,500 a year? It means that the
poor devil will have to "cough up" in order
to round out, the extraordinary wages now
paid to railway men. He will have to pay $3
per head for himself and each of the members
of his family, and in my province, where
families usually number at least five, it means
that the average family will have to pay $15
so that the aristocrats of the running trades
on the railways may collect their full wage.
Is that fair? For my part I think it is absolutely unfair.
Of course I know the reason for the Bill.
The gentlemen of the running trades, and, in
fact, of the labour unions of the railways,

SENATE
are very powerfully entrenched, very strongly
organized, and skilfully directed; and certainly
they do not lack courage. They know how
to "put it up" to the Governrment. I could
not help retaining in my mind what Professor McDougall said one day in explanation
of that fact. Indeed, such a discrepancy between the earnings of one class in the community and the earnings of other classes needs
to be explained. Water always finds its own
level unless it is held back. How have these
people protected themselves and made the
whole nation pay through the nose-for that
is what they are doing, and there is no getting
away from it? One might as well tell the
truth. Professor McDougall took a little
extract from the depositions of Mr. Ruel.
Vice-President and Chief Counsel of the
Canadian National Railway Company, before
the royal commission of 1932. Mr. Loree,
a member of that commission, after listening to a proposition made in the name of
the Canadian National whereby $30.000,000
would be saved to that railway, put these
questions to Mr. Ruel and received these
replies:
Conmissioner Loree: When you get through
with your five-year effort and everything, you
save about $30,000,000?
Mr. Ruel: Per annum.
Commissioner Loree: Yes. Why don't you
reduce wages 15 per cent and save $36,000,000
overnight?
Mr. Ruel: I wish we could.
Commissioner Loree: Why not?
Mr. Ruel: As far as the Government railways
are concerned, we would be ordered to cancel
that in twenty-four hours.

.

.

.

The C.P.R.

might do it; we could not. We would not
receive any support at all, we would be blackguarded all over Ottawa. We would not dare
to go on the streets, we would be chased out.
Now do you understand how it is that at
the beginning of last year, for instance, when
the men asked for and insisted upon a restoration of the 11 per cent that had been deducted
from their wages, they got it, although the
railways had resisted them and bad secured
a favourable verdict from a board of conciliation? You can sec the road they took
to get the full amount of their salaries. The
Government are afraid of them, and the men
get their own way. That is the position. We
are face to face with a privileged class. No
other class of labour is paid anything even
approximating what they receive.
The next point is this. Whatever the
country is going to pay to these railway men
will be paid by the taxpayers, even though
the taxpayers in large numbers do not earn
half the wages received by these men. This
Bill will take from those who have not and
will give to those who have. Is it fair? Is it
reasonable?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

There is something more. The Government,
who are dealing with the country's money,
can perhaps afford to squander that money
if they so desire, but what about the Canadian
Pacifie Railway? By a Bill of this kind we
say to the Canadian Pacifie: "Oh, yes, you
are making sacrifices for the purpose of
You expect to gain by the
co-operation.
savings that will result. Well, you shall not
gain. For a time you must pay 60 per cent of
those savings to your men." Is that fair?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Are you asking me?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I never address
myself personally to my honourable friend,
though he always favours me by addressing
me personally. Perhaps lie can rememýber that.
Now I conclude. Perhaps I have spoken
too long. I am not going to oppose the sending of this Bill to committee, for I understand
it is the desire of a number of honourable
members that it should go to a committee;
but I shall reserve my full liberty to vote
against it for the reasons I have mentioned.
Evidently the Government have but one
hope of settling the Canadian National
probleim-co-operation. Up to now co-operation bas done nothing, or practically nothing.
After five or six years it bas saved $2,000,000.
Last year the Canadian National Railway cost
Rougbly speaking, the loss,
us $54,000,000.
including the loss of interest on the money
already invested, and the new money put in,

amounted last year to $100,000,000.

And it

took five or six years to save about $2,000,000!
If the way to. solution of the problem lies in
co-operation, why should we take away all
incentive for the railways to co-operate? Will
the railways endeavour to save money when
they know that everything they save will have
to be paid out under this Bill? It seems to me
this would bolt the door to co-operation for
all time to come.
Hon. Mr. COPP: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I was wondering if the
sane argument which he quoted could be
used to attack the payment of senators' indemnities out of taxation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If the honourable
gentleman values his services as senator in
such a way as to be able to make a comparison
in the present instance, it is useless to attempt
any answer to his question.
LYNCH-.STAUNTON:
GEORGE
Hon.
Honourable senators, what my honourable
friend bas said is in principle absolutely
correct, but it must be remembered that

APRIL 26, 1939
socialist governments are influenced by
expediency rather than by principle. So it is
just a waste of time to argue about the
principle involved in the measure.
I have a reason for wishing to support the
Bill, if it is amended to suit me. The condition which we in Canada are now facing is one
that we brought upon ourselves. Years ago
the Government-I am speaking, not of a
Liberal or a Conservative Government, but of
the Government of Canada-departed from
the course of legislating for the purpose of
governing the country and began to legislate
for industrial and socialistic schemes. We took
over the Grand Trunk Ràilway and created a
strong competitor of the Canadian Pacifie.
After a while we realized in our hearts,
although we were afraid to say it, that there
was not room in Canada for two railways,
and that we had no use for the Canadian
National, which at huge expense had been
converted from what the late president of
that road referred to as a junk heap into
perhaps the finest railroad in America. But
there it was. We had built it up and thousands upon thousands of men had come into
its employ, supposing that they were entering
upon jobs that were good for their lifetime.
Working under a Government, as they were,
they had a right to believe that so long as
they were efficient their jobs were safe, because
a Government, unlike a private concern, can
carry on even if they are insolvent. The
amount of money paid to these railway employees, who are now being called the aristocracy of labour, is a matter of expediency,
not one of right or principle. It is expedient
to pay them this money, and expediency is
the governing principle with socialistic
administrations. So we cannot talk any
Administration, Conservative or Liberal, out
of doing what is being done.
I believe, as everybody I have talked to
believes-although it is not expedient to say
so publicly-that the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act of 1933 should have been
put into operation. That was not done,
because ail the railway employees were against
it and the Government had to obey their
masters. I think that a consolidation of these
two railroads which would turn men into the
streets would be a monstrous injustice. To
my mind, after having gone into this business with our eyes open and employed so
many men, we have no right to say that
because the venture is costing us an enormous
amount of money we will discontinue it, or
turn the Canadian National over to the Canadian Pacifie, or bring about a consolidation, if
any such course would result in the turning
of large numbers of men into the streets.
Whether it would be just or unjust, we could

239

not do that, for it would not be expedient.
It would cost some Government their life,
and no Government are going to agree to selfextinction to please somebody.
In my judgment the only way to alleviate
the present condition is to consolidate the
management of the roads and pension every
man who thereby loses his position, the cost
of the pensions to be borne in full by the
Dominion of Canada and not in part by the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as is
intended under this Bill. I should be prepared, so far as I can see now, to support

the Bill if it were amended to provide for
that. We brought about the present condition
and we should not shun our responsibility. I
do not think we have any power, authority
or right to order the Canadian Pacifie to
pay men who are discharged. If we have
any such power it is dictatorial and not
democratie.
In any event, I feel we should not pass a
Bill of this description without knowing what
its consequences would be. Two points occur
to me about which we should have information., Has the Canadian Pacifie saved any
money or got any benefit from whatever
consolidation or pooling bas been effected
under the authority of the 1933 Act? If so,
what is the extent of the saving or benefit?
In the second place, if this measure passes,
what will -be the cost to the Canadian Pacific?
If it will exceed the benefits to the railway under the Act, we should be grossly
unjust in making the railway shoulder the
responsibility.
Apart from other considerations, I believe
that if the State pensioned all employees of
either company who lose their positions
because of the operation of the Canadian
National-Canadian Pacifie Act, our path
towards ultimate consolidation of the railways
would be made much easier. I do not for one
moment think we should take over the Canadian Pacifie, or the Canadian Pacifie debt.
A couple of years ago I was a member of a
committee dealing with the railway question,
and I heard it admitted on both sides that
the business was divided about equally between
the two roads. I submit that if joint management were put into effeet each road should
receive half the total receipts, but each should
pay its own debts. It does not seem to me
that Canada should assume the debt of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, although it may be
possible to say a good deal in favour of that.
There should be only a joint management.
But we cannot have that so long as there is
fear of its resulting in men being thrown
out into the streets. I understand Sir Edward
Beatty said that under joint management
no employees would be let out. If that is so,

240

SENATE

we could agree to joint management; but if
it became necessary to discharge employees,
the country should pay the cost. And it
would be very much better for us to face
that now than to go on year after year adding
millions upon millions to our debt. The
second year that the Canadian National was
in operation I stated in the Senate that our
debt would grow like a snowball until it got
bigger than the Parliament Buildings.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether he would go so
far as te approve of compensation for those
who have already lost their employment
through co-operative efforts made during the
last five years?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
frank, I would if it were necessary.

To be

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What does the honourable gentleman mean by "if it were necessary"?
I want
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
justice to be done and Canada to get out
of this hole.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I shall vote that this Bill go te committee. Then, unless I ani convinced that it
should be rejected, I shall vote for third
reading.
This Bill is before us because, under an Act
passed in 1933, we ordered co-operation
between the two railvay systems. Truc, up
to date, even if you count all the applications the two railways companies have agreed
upon, the total savings will amount te only
about $2,000,000.
It will be seen on reference to the schedule
that five years is the maximum period of
payment to men who are deprived of employment. For the benefit of honourable senators
who are not nmembers of the Special Railway
Comnmittee, I miay cite an actual case. Between Bala and Wanup is a 141-mile section
on the Toronto-North Bay-Sudbury lines of
the Canadiaii Pacific and Canadian National.
Within that iileage those two ines are closely
parallel to each other. There is very little,
if any, local traflic. B the Canadian National
line being abandoned and the Canadian Pacifie
utiizcd for traffic of both raihvays, an annual
saving can be effected of 8161.000, or about
$80,000 for each railway. In effecting that
economy about sixty-five men will be thrown
out of work. Those men will include engineers, firenmen, conductors and Cthers. They
may go to any place where they are senior to
olier men. In other words, ultimately there
will be sixty-five fewer men employed on
the Canadian National Railways. This Bill
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

proposes that if they have worked fifteen
years or over they shall receive for five years
an allowance of 60 per cent of their average
monthly compensation during the last year of
their employment. Why should the railroad
that saves $80,000 a year not take care of
part of the wages of those men? At the
end of five years the payment to the men
would cease, and then the whole $80,000 saving
would go to the company. That is the principle underlying this Bill.
The honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) says that because the
railway employees are highly organized they
can demand this compensation. I would remind him that we are saying to the railroads,
"You must co-operate." Some members before
the committee suggested that we should compel them to co-operate. I can sec no reason
in the world why the Canadian National line
from Bala to Wanup should not be abandoned. There is, as I say, no local traffic
to speak of, and there would be a saving of
approximately $160,000 a year, or $80,000 to
each company. That line should be closed up.
But that
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
will not be donc by the Government against
tho wish of the railroad employees.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I do not mean the
Government. I want to be fair.
I mean,
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not this Government, but any Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is not the Government. We are dealing with mens lives and
occupations, not with dollars and cents, and
the sooner the mcmbers of this or any other
Chamber lcarn that men's lives are more important than dollars and cents, the better it
wil be for our country, for if we do not take
action along that line somebody else will do
it far botter for us. If the railroads can
sav-e 880.000 a year by the proposed abandonment. why should they not, for five years,
pay the men dispossessed of their jobs 60
per cent of their wages?
Hon. Mr. LYNCII-STAUNTON:

Sure.

lon. Mr. HAIG: That is wvat this Bill
stands for. I am accused by the railroad unions
of being an amalgamationist, in fact of being
the leader of the amalgamationists, and of
forgetting that ftie nien have rights. I asked
Sir Edward Beatty: "If amalgamation or
onifiention goes tlrougli. what will if mean
Io the men who will be thrown out of positions?" Ho said: "I think in five years, or
at most seven ycars, that whole problem will
be disposed of." Now, putting the limit at
five ears. this Bill takes care of that whole

APRIL 26, 1939
situation, and I think it is unfair for us to
say to the Canadian Pacifie and the Canadian
National that they must co-operate, unless at
the saine time we pass this proposed legislation.
I was very much impressed by what Sir
Edward Beatty said. I was worried, for, as
honourable members are aware, between here
and Toronto the pooling of traffie has thrown
a number of men out of their jobs, and no
provision has been made for thein.
The
evidence presented to our Special Railway
Committee convinces me that the major savings are due largely to the discharge of men
from the pay-roll, and, I think it is only
reasonable that those men should be taken
care of as is proposed by this Bill.
As I say, I arn agreea;ble tu the Bill being
referred to committee, but I should like the
House to realize that w'e want railway
co-ordination. I have listened very carefully
to Lhe evidence 'before our Special Railway
Committee, and I say quite candidly I 'believe
the only answer to our railway problemn is
unification.
To bring that about it is
imperative that the men thro-wn out of
Fmployment by such co-ordination be protected
by Act of Parliarnent. They should be not
only protected against loss of wages, but also
compen.sated for loss through enforced sale
of their homes and for the cost of moving to
other places for ernployment.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Dues the honourable gentleman expect railroading will come
back to what it used to 'be, or wilI he admit
that it is a dying business? And, if it is a
dying business, can we establish a basis upon
which ail our railway employees shaîl within
twenty-five years be on the pension list of
this country?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; my honourable friend
is wrong there. We are saying by Act of
Parliament that, for instance, the Bala-Wanup
section of the Canadian National Railways
must 'ho abandoned. Truc, the railýways bave
not carried out uur instructions, but that is
becausa we did not put enough teeth into the
Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act of
1933. As long as ýwe take that position, we
should bc responsible for the men displaced
by our legislation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I amn not talking
Will the
about any railway abandoninent.
honourable gentleman admit that the railroading 'business in Canada is a dying business?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do nut admit that the
railroading business in Canada is a dyîng
business. I admit that the evidence before
our committee shows the business of the

241

railroads bas over a period of years heen
gïadually declining as compared with general
business, and that the decline is due to truck
and 'bus and private automobile cumpetition.
I ar n ot questiuning that. In 1929 there
were 183,000 men and womcn employed by
the railroads of Canada; to-day there are
133,000. My figures may be slig-htly out, but
they are fairly correct. I arn not proposing
to superannuate the 50,000 who dropped out.
But if we say to the C.P.R., "Your road from
Winnipeg is to 'bceclosed up and the business
is to be carried over the Canadian National,"
and we providýe by law that that shall be
dune, then, tu the extent of 60 per cent, they
should be givenHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does the bonourable gentleman not think that this is what,
progressively, is going to happeni, that there
will be a closing of lines, amalgamations and
various other arrangements, and that year by
year the employees will be reduced in number
until ultimately they will aIl have corne
tîndeî' this clause?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; unly in the case of
amalgýamation or co-urdination.
Take the
situation west of Winnipeg: There are four
lines of railroad from Portage la Prairie west;
two Canadien Pacific and two Canadian
National. There is a proposai tu close up
twu of them. A certain number of men will
be thrown out of jobs. Now, that closing up
will benefit the railroad itself. If the railroad
abandons a piece of uine, as the Canadien
Pacifie told us it was doing in certain cases,
this legisîstion dues not affect the case. It
applies only when the railways have 'been told
to co-ordinate or amalgamnate.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: They will not be taken

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then the Bill is not
broad enough.
H-on. Mr. HAIG: That is another question.
The hasis of my argument is this. If by
legisîstion we provide that a road must be
closed up, that is une thing; if the Canadian
Pacifie or the Canadian National wants to
close up a road, that is its own business,
and the mon employed lose by that -action.

242

SENATE

The Canadian Pacifie men told us the other
daythey had closed up a road and had made
all the profits themselves, because they thought
that if they did otherwise they would lose
the business to the other road and give thern
half the profit to be derived from closing up.
In that case the men got nothing. Maybe
they should get something, but that would
not be in accordance with the principle underlying this Bill. Unless in the committee some
change can be shown to be necessary, I can
see no reason why the Bill should not pass,
and I am in favour of it.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There are a number of questions I should like to ask the
honourable gentleman if it were not six

opportunity to ask them.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But the
honourable gentleman said a while ago that
the money they saved was going to compensate these men.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: For five years.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. Is
nothing more than the money saved going
towards compensating these men?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I could not tell you offhand. Let me answer my honourable friend
this way. That would be something that
would be considered with reference to the
co-ordination. If the cost of compensating
the men on a line is $200,000 and all that can
be saved is $160,000, it will not pay to close
up the line; but if the cost of wages for five
years is $100,000 and the amount that can be
saved is $160,000, there will be a saving of
$60.000.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
care what the country will lose, for I think
it should lose all, but does my honourable
friend say that the Canadian Pacifie will not
lose anything by this measure?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, because it does not
have to co-ordinate unless it so desires.

BILL

SEOOND READING

Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL moved the
second reading of Bill 88, an Act to Encourage
the Improvement of Cheese and Cheese Factories.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the second reading of this Bill to assist the
cheese industry in Canada, I may say it is
not a new matter for either the Federal Government or the provincial governments in
this country to give assistance to the dairy
industry. All governments in Canada have
recognized over a long period of years that
the dairy cow is the finest colonizer in the
country, and that the sooner there are dairy
cows on the farm, the better for the farm and

APRIL 27, 1939
the farmer living on it. Consequently, governments began more than haif a century ago
to assi3t the dairv industry.
The first assistance of which 1 remember
began in 1891 in Prince Edward Island, where
the land had been somewhat depleted by cropping. A x isit from the then Dairy Commissioner. Prof essor J. W. Robertson, resulted
in his placing before the Government a plan
for the development of the dairy industry in
that province. As I heard a leading public
man in the Island say. Professor Robertson
literally preached cheesemaking to the people
there, with the resuit that joint stock companies were organized in almost every part of
the Island for the purpose of building cbeese
factories. It was agreed by the Minister of
Agriculture that if tbey erected a factory and
purchased machinery he would have the
cbeese manufactured at a fiat rate of one
and one-quarter cents a pound. In some
districts where there were only a small numnber
of cows to supply the milk, the cost for a
time would be more than the farmers would
actually pay, but this assistance was offered
by the Government with a view to encouraging
people to get cows and start in the dairy
business.
In 1892 a number of factories were buîlt. In
1893 more were built. In 1895 I walked ail
over Prince Edward Island, from Tignish to
Souris, and back and forth across it as far as
I could go withcnt stepping off the Island, and
the thing that struck me most was the
enthusiasm of the people for these cheese
factories. It was a new venture in farming,
and the resuit was that in three or four years,
on ail the farms whose soul had been depleted
and where there was nothing added but
mussel-mud to nourish it, the keeping of cows
increased the land's fertility and gave tbe
people milk, and a milk cheque from the
factory. The Government arranged to make
advance payments for milk once a montb or
once every two weeks. The cheese was not
marketed month by month at it is now. It
was shipped mostly ini the autumn, but tbe
farmers were paid every two weeks or every
month-I amn not sure wbicb.
That was the beginning in the Dominion
of Cana~da of organized effort on the part of
the Federal Government to help the dairy
industry get on its feet, and it was to some
extent necessary beoause the Government of
every country competing in dairy products
had given assistance to their farmers in dairy
efforts.
If I remember correctly, the next effort
along these lines was made in the Northwest
Territories in 1896, when tbe orgaiizatioli
of creameries was begun upon a somewbat

243

small scale. Part of the requisite money was
lent to the creameries by the Government,
and part was subscribed by people in the
various localities, and tbe Government agreed
to mamufacture the butter for four cents a
pound. Tbose creameries were started in the
Northwest Territories because there bad been
frequent frosts over a period of years. Frost
is flot quite as bad as drought, for in spite of
frost you can grow a good deal of feed for
your cows, but farmers wbo had been counting
upon reaping a fairly good barvest of wbeat
were greatly disappointed because of these
early frosts. The Government started these
creameries in Western Canada with a view to
helping such farmers to get established on the
land.
Cheesemakers were employed by the Governiment, and sent to tbe factories in Prince
Edward Island because there, were no skilled
cheesemakers in that province. Similarly,
skilled buttermýakers were sent from the East
to tbe West. Most of them came from
Ontario or Quebec, where tbere already were
dairy sehools from which qualified men were
graduating.
Those dairy products were made in factories.
We know now that for the sale of dairy
produets in any quantity they must be made
in factories, wbere the producers are able to
meet tbe requirements as to uniform quality
and grades, flot only for our borne market,
but for tbe markets of other countries as well.
The cheese industry in Canada has been
going up and down over a period of years,
depending somewhat upon the demand in
Great Britain and also, to some extent, upon
tbe way in which the business is pushed.
Tbe making of cheese is a much more difficult
process than the making of 'butter. The
bonuses or grants that are provided for in
this Bill will apply to the high grades of
cheese. And it must be remembered that
it *is just as easy to make a high grade of
cbeese as a Iow grade, provided the necessary precautions are taken by tbe farmers and
ail others who have anything to do with production. As a matter of fact, I have had a
few years' experience in watching the operations of cheese factories, and 1 know that the
factory which scores best at the end of the
year is the one which. holds a meeting early
in the season, before any milk is shipped at
ail. The meeting is flot restricted to the
people who make the cheese; ail who are concerned in the business are invited, and particularly the suppliers of milk. It is always
well to have a tinsmith present, and one
usuaily is. As honourable members know,
milk producers use a large number of cans,
and it is easy to understand ths.t the price

244

SENATE

of cans is a serious matter to many producers.
The buying of a new set of milk cans means
a very important financial outlay. So the
farmers bring ail their cans to these meetings,
in order that the tinsmith may solder any
places where the tin bas been eaten away by
rust. This has, tu be clone in order to prevent
infection of the milk by bacteria originating
in these rust spots. In the month of July,
when the making of cheese is going on,
bacteria arrive seemingly from nowhere, and,
as milk is the finest possible host for such,
they multiply at an almost inconceivable rate
unless they are kept in check. So the cheesemanufacturing process is a very difficult one.
I tbink that in Ontario there are about fiftcen
cheese instructors. When the weather gets
bot their telephones are in operation ahl the
time. TUey drive from factory to factory,
visiting probahbly three or four factories in a
day. and they often find new and unexpected
conditions.
Frequently a consultation is
neccs-.ary in order to discover what it is that
is prcventing the making of good cheese.
That is wby this Bihl encourages coosolidation of cheese factories. V/e ail know that
most of tUe cheese factories in Ontario-I
spcak of that province because 1 know it bestwere bujît a long tiîne ago, and many of tbem
arc in nced of extensive repairs. For the
most part these factories are small. If the
making of a large quantity of cheese is
suporx ised by one man, the quality is certain to Uc more uniforrn than if three or
four men had done the supervising.
W'hcn those old cheese factories were built
in Ontario it xvas the custom to draw mjlk
to thern by horse and wagon, but now most
of the mTilk is drawn on motor lorries, se that
thc distance Uctwcen farm and factory is
not as important as it used to be. Exerybody' iu the business in Ontario will tell you
that if you could consolidiate a group of say
four or five cheeseinaking companies, tear
cloxxn tbeir buildings and croct one new plant,
cx cr whiii thcre xvould Uc one man in charge,
a g(oneral improve inent in the quality cf the
1
product would bc noticcable.
But it is a
very difficuit thing to bririg about these
consolidations, as Î know frcm somne endeavoui'S I bav e made. Many a amaîl factory

of the cost of improving the machinery and
building, and of erecting a celd storage plant.
As a rule cold storage is a costly affair, but
for cheese it is net, because onîy cool storage
is required. Cheese does flot bave te be kept
at a very low temperature; s0 comparatively
littie machinery is necessary, more dependence
being placed upon insulation for maintenance
cf the proper temperature. About three years
ago the Government of Ontario made a small
grant available te ebeese factories wbicb
installed cool storage for warehousing their
cheese.
Ail cheesemakers are agreed that
cbeese sbould 'Uc kept in storage at the factory
for at least ten days. One of the difficulties
lias 'been that many factories bave not
sufficient storage space te bold ail their
clicese, for that period, tise resuit 'being that

APRIL 27, 1939
been in favour of that kind of thing and have
neyer taken part in anaý. The only article the
cansumption of which .1 would seek to
encourage by a campaign is milk, 'because I
think it is so important to the health of
cbjîdren. But a man can aat only a certain
quanýtity of food, and if hie increases bis
consuimption of cheese hie may cat less lamb,
and thc sheep growars will have a grievance.
So I ar n ot in favour of campaigns ta
encourage people ta cat this or that; 1 believe
it is better ta let people decide upon their
own d-iet. You remember when Josiah Allan
went ta the World's Fair and was drinking
tea, bis wif e warned him that be could bold
only five cups. We do flot want people ta
overfeed thamselves.
Our chief objective should be ta expand
the British market for our ceaese. In Great
Britain we are now getting a price of from
ane ta threa cents abave that paid for cheese
imported from New Zaaland. The reason is
that aur cheese suits the people aver
there.'
We seli some chease in the United Statas
for the making of cheese bi'scuits, because
aur produet will stand up wben it is sa used,
and whiat is made in the United States itself
is apparently softer. The people aver there
must bave something wrong witb their taetb;
a lot of whey is left in their cheese and
tbe produet is not pressed as firmly as ours.
The saine demand for firm cbeese exists in
Great Britain. When the Milk Board of
Great Britain started ta make cheese, tbey
had a number of badly aquipped buildings
and turned out an inferiar product. Tbe
British miner is very fond of cbeese and
likes it in sandwiches for bis lunch, but bie
also likes ta be able ta see it wben be is
eating. H1e founýd tbat when tbe Milk Board's
praduct was, used it campletely disappeared
by lunch-time, baving melted and soaked
into the two pieces of bread.
Can-adian
cheese is of such a class and character that
it will stand up, and sa it bas a good market
among miners and other workingmen in
Britain.
If we improve the conditions of aur cheese
factýories in the provinces, particularly ini
Ontario and Quebec, wbere we produce a
great deal of cheese, there is no doubt that
we can still further improve the quality of
aur ebeesa. If we can get it inta tbe No. 1
class and scoring 93 or 94 points, there will
be nat only a ready but a very keen demand
for it.
Section 8 prov-ides for payment of premiurns
of ana cent and twa cents a pound, respectively, on cheese scaring 93 and 94 points.
In same quarters it is asserted that the
Dremium ougbt ta be extended ta a l'ower

24à

grade; but, with somne improvement in equipment, ahl aur factories can reach these two
high grades. There will be same incentive
for them ta do this. because then they wil
be able ta organize tha farmars and induce
tbem ta supply tbeir milk in proper condition for tbe production af a bigb-class article.
I saw a striking illustration of this in
Brockvilla a few years aga. The Avondale
farru is locatad nearby-an bonaurable senator
knaws where it is-and it is managed by
Tom Davidson. H1e was very mucb disgusted
that a local creamery was turning out an
inferior grade of butter; sa aver a period of
two or thraýe montbs he offered prizes in
the form of neck yokes, wbippletrees, and a
set of harness ta farmers wha braught in
first-grade cream. The effect was remarkable.
Witbin a short time the quality of tbe cream
impraved ta such a degree that in awarding
the prizes the difflculty was ta dacide, not
whether any man's cream was sufficiently
high-grade ta qualify, but which of ail the
higb-grade creams was the best.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Could the haonourable gentleman state the average price
paid for milk sent ta the cheese factories
hf bas referred ta?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I think it was
stated the other day in another House that
at the present price of aheesa it would run
ta about 60 cents a hundred pounds, less the
cost af hauling. This, I know, is a law price,
but the farmer is producing several things
for whieh bie cannat get a very bigh return.
Ilon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think my
honaurable friand must be wrong wben hie
says 60 cents, a bundred. That is 6 cents a
gallon. Would that be for milk running in
butter-fat about 3J per cent?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: When this quotation was given, I think chease was selling at
about 10 cents a pound. The question was
askad, wbat that would net the farmer for
bis nilk. It was sajd it would net hjm about
60 cents, which I assura my hanourable friand
it nat a very higb price. But I arn afraid hae
doas nat understand for how littie the
farmars in this country have ta work.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yas, I do. I
shaîl follow my honourable friand in a minuta.
11an. Mr. MARSHALL: That price may
saam very small ta him, but it is a raturn
many farmars ara compalled ta taka, espacially
whan tbey cannot make money any other
way.
The purpose of this Bill is ta encourage
the improvamant of aur cheesa factories, s0

SENATE
that our cheese will command a higher average price, and thus give the farmer a better
return than he is getting at the present time.
With very few exceptions all the cheese
factories in Ontario are co-operative ventures
owned by the farmers themselves. The exceptions will not affect the result, because today the sale of cheese from all Ontario
factories is made at the cheese board, that is,
the cheese is sold by public auction, and the
price paid by the owners of the private
factories for milk to the farmers approximates that paid by the co-operative factories.
The premiums provided for by section 8,
to which I have referred, would give the
farmer at least an additional 12 cents a
hundred pounds for his milk.
The grants to be made under the authority
of this Bill would not only stimulate the
cheese industry and enable our cheese factories to continue in operation, but would also
retard the production of butter. Always there
is a large volume of milk which must be converted into butter or cheese, and just as soon
as we reduce the production of cheese we
find the production of butter increases. We
have not yet established a first-class export
market for our butter, and the result is that it
becomes what is called a "drug" on the
domestic market.
I believe if this Bill goes into effect it will
result in the consolidation of some of our
clieese factories, say, two or three into one
in some cases, and thus reduce the cost of
operation. improve the grade of cheese. and
afford better storage facilities so that the
cheese can be better handled before it is
shipped to Montreal for export. It will also
enable the Government to assist the owners
of private factories who desire to improve
their equipment and turn out cheese of uniform size.

For these reasons I think this Bill ought to
receive the support of all honourable members.
Hon. H. A. MULLINS: Honourable senators. I congratulate the honourable gentleman from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) on speaking loud enough to enable me to hear every
word he said. I do not know why the curtains in our galleries are drawn back, for
the sound seems to travel towards the galleries
instead of towards the sides of the House. I
know that when I have been in the end
galleries of the Commons I have been able
to hear very well, although I have not been
able to do so in the side galleries. My hearing is not bad, and I think that if honourable members would only speak up and
Hon.

Mr. MARSHALL.

articulate clearly nobody would have any
difficulty in hearing them.
I am glad that at least there is someone
in the House who stands behind the cow. We
have heard so much about the trouble of
guaranteeing prices of wheat that I am glad
to hear the honourable gentleman talk about
the cow. For a number of years I sat in the
other House and spoke of ber value to Canada. As I drive along the road I would rather
look at a herd of well-bred cattle than at a
field of wheat. I know the troubles that
come out of wheat-growing alone.
I do not agree with my honourable friend
from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall). I have no
use for the churn dash. What are you going
to dio with millions of pounds of butter on
hand? There is butter packed in all our cold
storage warehouses.
In the early days I
used to see cheese piled up in Montreal and
selling for practically nothing. Compare that
result with what you would get from a herd
of well-bred beef cattle. The calf that is
raised on the mother excels the one on skim
milk. My honourable friend has written a
book on farming. It is all very well to write
a book about live stock, but it is an entirely
different matter to translate theories into
practice by going out on the land and becoming a farmer. I do not want to have anything to do with the churn dash. Give me
a well-bred calf raised on the mother, for
veal or beef.
The other day I read an article by Henry
Ford. He did away with the horse, and now
he is talking of doing away with the cow.
Chemistry is to replace ber. Well, God help
the country when you do away with the cow.
I think back over the years about our old
brindle cow. She raised my brother and me
in the town of Lindsay. What a valuable cow
she was te our householdt
We are talking about giving away butter
to the Red Cross in order te reduce the huge
surplus now in cold storage, and yet the
honourable memiber is advocating the passage
of a Bill which, if enacted, will tend t@ bring
about a large surplus of cheese and increase
our stocks of butter. I am astonished at these
inconsistencies, for I have read his books and
admired their illustrations of many well-bred
animals. I repeat, the writing of a book bears
little relation to the practical operations on
the farm. The man on the farm who is bit
in the ribs when his plough strikes a stone is
far ahead of the man who seeks to learn
something about farming by reading these
wonderful books. I congratulate my honourable friend on writing these books for the
Imperial Oil Company; they are well written.
As for me, my life, honourable members, was

APRIL 27, 1939
forged on the prairies and farms of Western
Canada-the open book of nature.
1 knaw an honouraýble member sitting in this
Huse, one of the most brilliant minds in
Canada, who as a 'boy sold milk by the quart.
He knows something about the dairy industry.
It is a laborious undertaking as comparcd with
the raising of well-hred calves suckled on the
mother. When they reach maturity you have
somethîng on your farm to look at. My
honourable friend from Peel knows that as
well as I do.
In .my opinion, if this Bill is put into effect
its only resuit will ibe to stirnulate the
manufacture of cheese to the point where the
market will 'be glutted and the farmer will get
very little for his product. Oh! there are so
many persons giving advice to, the farmer that
I wonder ho-w hie succeeds on the farm at ail.
Dairy cows are ail right -when close to, a
city where you have a market for your milk,
but otherwise 1 prefer beef cattle. In the
Bible I read the story of the introduction of
those spotted animais that you see in the
fields. I think they were the greatest curse
that ever struck the country. I have no use
for them at ail. Jacob and Laban made a
dleal that ail the ring-straked, speckled and
grisled cattle should be Jacob's. I recornmend
honourable members to read that passage in
Genesis. It is the first deal for profit recorded
in HoIy Writ. Jacob trimmed Laban in
getting those cattie for.bis share.
The production of beef cattle will put the
farmer in a good position. You cannot have
a successful f arm unless you have well-bred
cattle on it. I arn talking, not of pure-bred,
but of well-bred cattle. The farmer who will
feed cattle in the winter time, instead of
running around the country listening f0
demagogues who tell him ho(w to get along
without working, will *be successful. I arn
speaking from experience, not from a book.
I have had fifty years' experience in feeding
live stock.
In this connection I think of a former
member of this House. I refer t0 the late
Senator Cochrane. He was born in Compton
in 1823. He commenced breeding cattle in
1865, when hie made his first purchases of
Shorthorns and Herefords, stock from the
herds of W. H. Stone, of Guelph, and other
cattle that hie picked up in different. parts of
Ontario. His first purchase of pure-bredr, was
made in 1867 at an average cost per bead of
500 guineas. In 1868 the senator purchased
pure-breds from Captain Gunter, of Weatherley, at a cost of 1,000 guineas. 1 do flot care
wbat price is paid for welI-bred cattle. I do not
care what the Government do with the money
they are taxing the people so heavily to get,

247

so long as the farmer is induced to go in
for live stock and mixed farming.
I was manager of the Cochrane Ranch. If
was built up from a smaîl beginning. In 1870
importations included. forfy head of shorthorns and a lot of Berkshire bogs. The lasf
importation was m.ade at a cost of $70,000.
When tbe senator branched ouf on the
Western Prairie he had a ranch of 66,500
acres of land and 12,000 cattle. I was manager
of that ranch for a number of years. I may
say for the information of honourable senafors
that the watch which I have in my pocket was
given to me by the directors of the company
as a token of esteem, and in recognition of
my services as manager. I never used a book,
I neyer used a paper, I used practical common
,sense in the feeding and producing of cattle.
Do I love the cow? Yes, I do. Let me
tell honourable senators of an incident that
occurred during my campaign in 1930. I was
making a speech in Angusville. In the course
of if I referred to, the importation of eggs from
China, and to various other things that were
broughf in, f0 the disadvantage of the man
on the land. Finally 1 spoke of the cow.
As 1 was speaking a cow bellowed at the back
of the hall, and everybody laughedSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: -so I fold the
audience I was talking cow language. I got
threc hundred votes in the district while niy
opponent got only fifteen.
An Hon. SENATOR: From the cows?
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Yes, from the cows.
When I first started in business I walked
into the city of Toronto with a cow at the
end of a rope. I remember sitting on the
prairie wifh an bonourable member of this
Chamber who has since passed away, and
falking wif h him about the value of the cow.
He was faking a cow into Minnedosa. He
sfarted in a humble way, but when he died
hie left an estafe worth $6,000,000. I refer to
the lafe Senator Burns.
Yes, I value the cow, and I value hier prociucf, the caîf. I know whaf fhey have done
for Western Canada. Western Canada was
ricb in caff le, but the Nestors got hold of the
land and drove the cattle men out.
My honourable friend taîks about bringing
back the fertilif y of the soil. He says, "Go
back to the churn dash." No, honourable
members, I will not advocate to, any farming
community the making of cheese. I will fell
the farmer f0 raise well-bred Shorthorns first,
and the other breeds afferwards. I have bad
something f0 do with the live stock industry
of the Wesf, and 1 say the farmers there have
had no chance at ail since the demagogues

SENATE
arrived on the scene with their various
nostrums. They preached a new doctrine.
They said: "Don't work on the farm. We will
tell you what to do. You won't have to
work." Honourable members have heard some
of the promises that have been made in
another part of this building-the talk of
making use of the printing press, and all
sorts of things. Why, those demagogues even
started to print money. Here is one of their
bills. It bears the inscription "Prosperity Certificate." Honourable senators, no man can
succeed on the farm unless Le works; there
is no panacea that will relieve him of the
necessity of working. Those doctrines which
are being preached so disturbed the men
working on my farm that I Lad to sell out.
A farmer, to be a success, must diversify;
he must have live stock on his farm. In the
old days, fifty odd years ago, when the buffalo
were roaming the plains, we had fertile land
and buncl-grass grew all over the country.
But when the Nestors came along the land
was broken up and sown with other stuff,
and to-day there is nothing but weeds. I
understand that we are to have a Bill for
fle rehabilitation of the land south of the
main line. I say to honourable members of
this House, leave the land alone; take the
fences down and let it go back to the ranchers.
They stepped aside and gave the land to the
farmer. They said, "If you can do a better
job than we have done, you may have it." I
had twenty thousand acres of land under
lease. south of Medicine Hat. When the
farmers came in there they camped on the
water-holes, and the cattle could not get to
them. Truc, there are plenty of rivers, but
in going to them for water the cattle had to
travel from five to seven miles either way.
No wonder they got thin. Give me the open
range!

Later I came to Manitoba, and for thirty
years I fed my cattle, and I have yet to make
a loss. TLere are men in this House who have
seen me working on my own farm. I was not
above working. I fed five hundred cattle.
I was out looking after the herds at seven
o'clock in the morning. Whatever success I
had was the result of work. Well-bred cattle
will pay any man if Le works and gives them
proper attention in the winter time; but you
might as well throw your feed away as feed
it to scrubs.
I sometimes think of the old habitants
along the St. Lawrence river. They grew large
crops of hay and fed the live stock and made
homes for themselves. You have to make of
your farm a home, not a boarding-house. The
farm is a beautiful place to live, and if is the
best investment that any man can have to-day.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS.

I am worried about the youth of this country
and have given considerable thought to what
can be donc for them. It seems to me that
these men could be put on farms on some
of the Indian reserves. With their families
around them they could be happy and could
make a success of life. There should be an
instructor with them. He should not be a
professor ont of a college; the man who Las
experienced lard knocks is the best tutor
these men could have to teach them how to
farm right. What is prettier than a well-kept
farm with a road down the centre and fields
of leguminous crops on either side?
We have the richest country in the world,
and there is no reason why we should not
prosper. I am speaking from experience. Books
may be of assistance, and I like to turn over
the pages to sec if I can learn anything
from them; but experience and some knowledge of the ups and downs of life in the great
open spaces give a man a better education
than any book can ever give him.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Will my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
allow me to correct my answer to him? The
mistake was a stupid one. In answering the
honourable gentleman I should have said 74
cents. not 60 cents. After the cost of fabrication and so on is deducted, when cheese is
selling at ten cents a pound, there is 74 cents
per hundred pounds of milk coming to the
farmer. I apologize for having made the
mistake.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I do not think the corrected figure
which the honourable gentleman Las just given
the House will improve the situation very
much. I do not pretend to be as much of an
authority as my honourable friend, but let me
say to him that I was born and brought up
on a farm, and, probably very unwisely so far
as I am concerned, I have been operating
a dairy farm for the last twenty-five years.
Naturally, therefore, I am interested in the
dairy business.
Every time I visit the country I cannot but
note the sorry straits in which the farmer
finds himself. This is chiefly due to the fact
that Le gets a very low price for the milk his
My honourable friend will
herd produces.
realize that if a dairy farmer sells milk containing 34 per cent butter fat at ten cents a
gallon there is an actuel loss. No man cau
keep a herd of cattle and feed them properly
and make anything but a loss at ten cents a
gallon. $1 a hundred. A few may get a higher
price if they sLip their milk to Montreal.
I fail to see what this Bill is going to do to
Lelp the dairy farmer. A great many dairy
farmers are not in tla cheese business. nor

APRIL 27, 1939
are they interested in it. They either send
their milk to a condensery or ship it to the
city. But let us assume that a dairy farmer
does take his milk to a cheese factory, as my
honourable friend has suggested. If he gets
7 or 71 cents a gallon, or 74 cents a hundred,
as my honourable friend has said, such a low
price can result in nothing but a loss. If we
assume that he is in very good luck, and the
cheese grades 93 or 94, he may get two cents
more. But looking at the matter from the
dairy farmer's point of view, with all due
respect to the profound knowledge of my
honourable friend, I cannot see that this Bill
is going to benefit the dairy industry very
much; and, knowing the farmers as I do-and
I live in a good farming and dairying country
-I do not think the margin of profit is going
to be enlarged by this Bill, or that the Bill
will be entertained very favourably by the
producers of Canada.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I wish to call attention to
only one feature. The Bill provides a bonus
of one cent for second-grade' cheese and two
cents for the highest grade. That feature -I
pass, having nothing special to add.
The other feature is that it grants fifty per
cent of the cost of raw materials for either
of two purposes: first, the erection of cheese
factories, which necessarily, by the Bill, involves the consolidation of two, three or more
factories into one; or, second, the installing
of insulation and refrigeration facilities in
existing plants.
Hon.
house.

Mr. MARSHALL:

A curing ware-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Have I used
the right terminology?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You will find it in
section 7: for "construction. reconstruction,
insulation, refrigeration and equipment of
cheese factories."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For the time
being I will deal only with the feature I have
last mentioned, the granting of 50 per cent
of the cost of raw materials for the purpose
of encouraging companies to consolidate
factories and build more modernized plants,
or, on the other hand, to modernize their
existing plants. To my knowledge this has
been pretty well done already in Western
In Alberta and particularly in
Canada.
Saskatchewan, which is now a very good dairy
province. the plants are modern, large, and
efficient. It is right here in Ontario and
Quebec that the plants are small and not
modern, and therefore inefficient. It does not

249

seem fair that governmental assistance should
be given to people in the older sections of
our country, whereas people in the newer sections had to bear all the cost themselves.
In that respect
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there are compensations which at times bring
about a fair average as between provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It seems very
strange to me. I know that many of these
cheese factories in Ontario used to be, and I
presume they still are, owned co-operatively by
farmers, or by small joint stock companies
with farners as shareholders, but a large
numfber are owned by cheese manufacturers
who buy their milk at the market price.
This Bill does not provide that the bonus
shall find its way into the farmer's pocket.
It may go to the manufacturer, the converter
of the farmer's product. I am not sure that
this would be a bad thing, but it is proper to
emphasize that in a very large proportion of
cases, or so it seems to me, that is what will
happen.
Does my right
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
honourable friend refer to the grant of 50
per cent or to the bonus for cheese?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Both. If
the factory is owned by a manufacturer he is
going to get the benefit on both counts.
But will the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
farmer not benefit if better cheese is produced
and a higher price is received for it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He may
receive a benefit in that way, but it would
be a remote one. Mind you, I think the
country as a whole will benefit by the modernization of these plants. That is needed in
Ontario and Quebec. Having regard to the
number of plants owned privately, it seems
very strange that the owners themselves have
not long ago responded to the demands of
the times for standardization of products,
which is possible only in large establishments,
and that they have to be coaxed and bonused
by the Government to do so. There may
be reasons I do not know of.
I am only calling attention to two facts.
First, we are doing for the central provinces
what the West has already done for itself.
In the next place, we are providing direct
benefit for the secondary processman without
being at all certain that in the main it will
be passed on to the farmer. As I have said,
it seems to me that it will remain with the
manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. A. C. HARDY:
ilenourable senaters, one of the facts mentioed by the right
lionourable gentleman
(Rigbt Hon.
Mr.
Meighen) seemns te me the principal reasen
wiïv we should support this Bill. 1 can say
that in eastern Ontario-the only part of
the country withi whichi I am well enoughi
ac'quainted to speak in this connection-for
Cx erv well-furnished. up-to-dateceheese factory' there is at least one, if there are not;
to or more. in a cleplorable condition. I
hav e been surprised that thie manufacture of
cheese for expert should be permitted in semne
of the places 1 hav e seen. This Bill. it scems
t o me, prox ides a remedy that xviii go te the
very root of the trouble.
The right honourabie gentleman says that
Western manufacturers have already modemnized their plants. Well, I would point eut
that the pioncer cheesemaking was donc in the
eider parts of the country, in Ontario and
Quebec. That is where the g-reat Canadian
cheese industry was buiit up, an industrv
xxbese produets hav e met with se much faveur
.aWroad. It is principaliy old pioncer factories
that arc in need of rebabilitation. Wc cannet
hope te hoid our valuable export business
unless we continue te suppiy the highcst grade
cf products, and ccrtainly modcrnized facteries
oi lielp us te do that. It is because this
Bill will encourage the modernization and
general imprevemnent of facteries that I think
il so worthy of our support.
My honourable friend from Aima (Hon.
Mr. Ballantvne) seems te tbink that the
farmers tbemselves wiil net benefit greatly
under Ibis Bill.
His city of Montreal î.s
surrounded by a thickly populated, old ami
fairly rich dairy district in which. I tbink,
cheese is net one of the principal produets.
I am net sure of thiat, but my understanding
is that the milk produced in that district us
used principally for butter or for the fluid
milk suppiy of the city. The situation there

xx
lere chicese factories are reiativeiy far more
important. It is truc thiat iuu castere Ontario
in enermous quantity of rnilk is now being
sold te condenseries. That is partly explained
by the drop in demand for miik by the cheeseinakers there.
Many of the factories had
become antiquated and their productz couid
ne longer cempete withi those of factories in
Oxford and some of the other richi counties in

say a fcw words in reply te the criticism
expressed *by the rigbt honourable leader on
the ether side (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighien),
whicli criticism lie made, I know, with a view
te being lielpful.
The Government must sec that the bonus

at public auctien on cheese boards, and the
price is purbiisbed evemy day.

factories te psy the farmer as higb a price as

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: In what, wav

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I think there will
be ne difficuity in making reasunable arrangemonts 'with themn te do se.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It xviii be part
of the centract?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes. As a matter
of fact, there are only nine cheese factories
in Saskatchewan and nine in Alberta, while
in Ontario thero are 635 and in Que'bec 388.
I do net want te say anything at aIl sgainist
cheese produced in Western Canada, but 1

Territories, where hie was first employed with
a travelling dairy. Hie later became Dairy
Commissioner for Alberta, and, afterwards,
Professor of Dairying in the University of
Alberta. Mr. Ruddick considered hie was one
of the best dairymen in Canada. As I say, a
number of other very able dairymen came
there frorn Denmark, men like Dan Morkeberg and Peter Pallison. Mr. Pallison was
the noblest Roman of thern all. These people
establislied an entirely different standard of
butter. with the resut that they were imitated
by- other producers in the province.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is the No. 1 butter
province in Canada to-day?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Manitoba is. But
it did ot hold that distinction when I was
living in Alberta. In those days Alberta producedl the best butter in the West aud won the
hig-hest prizes at fairs.
My honourable friend from Aima (Hon.
.Mr. Ballantyne) said that a farmner would lose
money as a resuit of this Bill. Well, hie will
Inse less than hie is losing now if the price of
cheese is increased by two cents. It is al
right to say that a man -cannot produce milk
and seil it for 74 cents a hundred pounds,
but the fact is that this is being done.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But hie loses
on it.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No, hie does flot,
because hie has nothing to lose. That reminds
me of the story about the young farmner who
went to a Farmers' Institute meeting, where
the speaker emphasized the importance of
keeping books. Next winter the fariner went
to a similar meeting, and when the samne
speaker again appeared hie said to him: "I
do not want to hear anything more from yôu
about keeping books. After what you told
me last year I started to keep books and I
seemed to lose money every month. 1 went
into the hoie for, the first time in my life. I
used to make out flot so badly before." As
a matter of fact, farming is flot so much a
business as it is an occupation. A man, bis
wife and two or tbree children, as the case
may be. go on a farm, and once tbey get to
own it they have a home for themselves.
Even though they make but littie money,
y-ou would be surprised at how mucb they can
save.
Does my
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable friend say that a dairyman can
make a profit out of selling milk at a dollar
per hundred pounds?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I know men who
have sold milk at that price and have built
gond houses and barns.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Not with what
they made out of milk.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Milk was their
chief product. I should like to, see a higher
price, because I do not tbink a farmner sbould
have to sel1 niilk for any purpose whatever at
less than $1.25 per hundred pounds.
The lowest price for milk has been paid by
cheese factories. In Ontario the Milk Board
bas fixed a ratio between fluid milk and manufactured milk, and farmers who are supplying
milk to plants wbicb make milk powder are
getting a higher price ncw I hope to see
the day when in this country we shall follow
the plan tbat bas been adopted in England.
There ail tbe milk is pooled and the price is
averaged, so that every producer gets the
samne price, regardiess of wbat his milk is
used for. To order to keep the price fromn
falling below a certain level the Government
contribute a bonus. whicb last year amounted
to over £400,000, about $2,00O,000.
From this Bill the fariner will get an increase in price of about fourteen or fifteen
cents per hundred pounds over what be is
getting now. I wilI guarantee that witb that
increase bie will be able to make a little more
money and live a littie better than be does
at present.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

APRIL 27, 1939
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who is to
operate the airport, and why do the Government decide how it is to 'be operated? I am
not saying they could not so decide. They
certainly shouild in an emergency have the
right to occupy it entirely. What are the
rights of the City of Toronto on the one hand
and of the Government of Canada on the
ether?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is all set out
in section 4 of the agreement, on page 4 of the
Bill. It defines what the commissioners are
to do:
The commissioners shall, in particular, but
not so as to restrict their general powers and
duties, have in respect to the airport the f ollowing powers and duties, namely:(a) To lease, upon such terrms and conditions
as the commissioners may deem advisable, any
land forming part of the airport but not required for purposes of the airport proper, for
any tern not in excess of two years and to
execute any document in connection therewith
on behalf of and in the narne of the City;
(b) To negotiate leases of any of the said
land for terms in excess of two years or sales
thereof and to make recommendations in
respect thereto to the council of the City. No
such lease or sale shall be made except in strict
conformity with the rules and regulations pertaining to airports as from time to time in
force;
(c) To effect collection of all such tolls and
revenues as may from time to time be authorized by the said regulations;
(d) To keep, observe and perform on behalf
of the City the covenants, provisoes and conditions by the City to be kept, observed and
performed ceontained in the leases to His
Majesty the King and Trans-Canada Air Lines
hereinbefore referred to and in any lease
hereinbefore or hereafter entered into of any
portion of the airport and to enforce on behalf
of the City all covenants, provisoes and conditions by the lessee to be kept, observed and
performed by the terms of any of the said
leases;
(e) With the approval of the Commissioner
of Assessment of the City, te dispose of any
buildings or structures on the airport not
required for airport purposes.
(f) To maintain insurance to such amount
as will protect the City and the commissioners
from any claim for damages for personal injuries (including death) or for damages to
property, arising from any alleged negligence
in the construction or operation of the airport.
My friend to the left (Hon. Mr. Robinson)
tells me that section 2 of the agreement
covers the matter entirely. I will read it
with the introductory words:
Now, this agreement witnesseth that the
parties hereto have agreed as follows:Then comes section 1. This is section 2:
The commissioners will control, maintain,
manage and operate the airport and any
additions thereto on behalf of the City subject
to the leases aforesaid and subject to the provisions of this agreement so as to secure the

most effective operation of the same consistent
with good management.

As I understand, all this Bill does is to
have the agreement ratified by the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I read the
Bill and recognized that the schedule contains
the contract between the City of Toronto
and the Toronto Harbour Commissioners,
and that the commissioners are bound to live
up to the covenants.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But under regulations issued by the Minister of Transport.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The situation must be this. The City of Toronto
acquired the property for the purpose and
entered into an agreement with the Government of Canada and the Trans-Canada Air
Lines 'to build an airport and to give certain
rights therein to the Government and to the
company. The City also made an agreement
with the harbour commissioners to operate
the port and deal with properties not included
in the leases, and to indemnify the City and
keep all the covenants which the City had
entered into with the Government and the
airlines company. The supervisory control of
the Government, I presume, consists only in
their general regulations as regards the landing area needed, and would apply to every
airport. If my general conception of the Bill
is right, I am satisfied. I do not wish to take
up time unnecessarily.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In the other
House the Minister explained that this
arrangement was carried out according to general rules by which the Government help the
various municipalities that have airports. So
the cost to the federal treasury or TransCanada Air Lines is considerably reduced.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will ask the
Minister to furnish the Senate with the regulations which govern the organization of airports.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I should
like to sec them.

country just as Hitler is handling Germany.
A!nd thie men who are calling for ai these
things are the men who are screaming against
National Socialism and ail it means. With
every dernand they are driving us dloser to it.
Now I take the other phase, for I want
to be very brief. We are saying to the
privately-owned road: "You have effected
sorne economies in your operation. You
always had a right to do that. You would
have done it in any event, no0 doubt, though
perhaps in ýanother way. That is your business. But we are going to make you pay to
your ernployees a part of those savings." I
wonder whether Parliament considers the
responsibility entailed in that.
-I well recali when, because of impending
bankruptcy, a bankruptcy which would affect
the Government of Canada as an integral
unit, because it was the rnortgagee of the
property. we found it necessary to make an
arrangement with the Grand Trunk Railway.
The Grand Trunk Railway implored us to do
sornething to prevent the consequences to
Canada. The irnportunity continued monith
after month for years, until the consequences
came so close that we had to act. We acted,
not by compulsion, but by an agreement
in the terns of which both sides had their
full say. Under the termas of that agreement
a board of arbitrators was to decide what
rights stockholders of the agreeing company
were to have. And the ternis of the agreement were followed to the letter. But to this
hour Canada has stood indicted before the
citizens of Great Britain with having acted
wrongfully, with having interfered with their
business, and the credit of Canada bas sudffered. I do not think, and neyer did think,
there was the shadow of a ground for any
coiuplaint; in fact, 1 arn certain there was
not. Is it possible that honourable members
can even conceive of the possibility of a corresponding case arising in Canada?
I speak only as a Can-adian. I have never
had the faintest affiliation, connection or

255

business association-not even to the extent
of a ten-cent piece-with the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Comnpany. Much that I have felt
it my duty to do publicly bas been impeached
and derided by it; but I arn Canadian enough
to recognize that there is no single institution
on which the success and integrity and
name of Canada depend so much as upon
the Canadian Pacific Railway. In the eyes of
the world it is more or less synonyrnous with
Canada; it is our greatest institution. Its
prospects are by no means as bright as they
were years ago. Parliarnent in the past bas
seen fit to enact legislation affecting that
cornpany, and ail railways, in respect of what
we conceived to be public rights. But Parlianment now for the first time uýndertakes to
legislate as respects private rights in relation
to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, wherein the
public are in no way affected; as respects
the private rights of certain men in its own
employ. There is no doubt that the cornpany
bas the right, if it sces fit, to make agreements
covering this matter, and it must be agreed
that ail would be glad if it could and would
do so; but it is another thing for us f0
legislate and thereby ereet an obligation
against the Canadian Pacific Railway in favour
of certain of its ernployees.
What if the prospects of the eompany
become darker still? It is not beyond the
imagination of anybody that they rnight. They
are pretty dark now for many of those who
put up vast surns foq the cornpany and hold
cornpany securities. The preferred and the
comimon stockholders get nothing now, and
the common stockholders have not received
anything for years. So the denial of any
return whatever on securities cornes home to
ail shareholdýers in ail the lands of the world.
Should the days get darker stili, in what
position will the people and the Government
of this country stand? Will the position of
the Govcernment be nearly as good as it was
iii respect of complaints of senior shareholders
and prefej-red stockholders of the Grand
Trunk? We did not legislate on any private
obligation of the Grand Trunk. If we had
donc so, we should be in a very hurniliating
position to-day: we could flot answer the
allegations leveiled at us. I wonder if the
Government bave considered that the day may
corne when allegations based on this very
legisiation wili be levelled at the Diominion
oi Canada, allegations that I for one could
not answer. Standing in my place as a nieraber of Parliament, I ask the Governmient to
tell me what their answer would be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 have a few
observations to make on that point.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope se.
I tell the Minister again that for the first time
in history we are interfering in the private
business of a company, not as respects the
public, but with respect to its own employees.
We are creating obligations which are binding
on the company. Will there be no responsibility on us who do this thing if the day
comes when these securities are universally
regarded as worthless and the credit of Canada
suffers?
I ask the Government to consider these
matters, and I ask honourable members to
consider them, because I for one am not
at ail sure that in years to come we shall not
be dcbgting the wisdorn of what bas been donc.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: If the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is about to
speak on the Bill, I miglit seize the opportunity
for a moment or two of introducing another
thought on which he nay cogitate. Under
the McAdoo award ail contracts between the
railways and their employees observe the
principle of seniority to the limit. Where
economies are to be achieved by the laying
off of employees, the senior men bump, as the
expression is, the men junior to them, and so
on down to the bottor of the list. That is to
sav, when engincers are laid off they are
taken on as firemen, and junior firemen are
then laid off and bump the wipers beneath
themru. And so it goes. Fron this it is fairlv
obvious that the men who will be laid off in
large numbers are the juniors.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: These junior men
in age from thirty to thirty-five and
forty. They are usually rarried, fathers of
young and growing families, and it so happens
that large numbers of them served in the lae
war. Upon tlheir return frorn overseas they
entered into the railway service in good faith,
but teiy have never got far enough ahead te
be unaiffected by legislation of tis kind. Thev
have perhaps tein, twelve, fifteen or more
years' service to their credit, and it is thley
wvho will suffer, who will he the victims of
reductions iii expenditures.
Now, it scems to me that thore would b
mruee justification for paying a pension to
men at the age of sixty, who have thirty or
thirty-fixe years service, than for giving the
form of assistance that is proposed here to
active men who are prepared to put in a ful]
day's work every day and who need to do so
in order that they may carry out their
obligations to thoir wives and familios. Of
course. I know that matters of this kind are
worked ont on an acfuarial basis. The retirerange

ment age for railway employees is now sixtyHon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

five, and throughout the country there are a
considerable mimber of men between sixty
and sixty-five who are driving engines. In
many instances I think they are too old for
the job, because the responsibility of being in
charge of a powerful engine with a long
passenger train lbehind it is very great. I want
to inquire whether it would not be a good
thing to retire railway men at sixty, to pension
thern off then for their own good and also in
order to create employment for men who are
junior to them.
I agree with the statement that this Bill
does not represent the final step that will
have to be taken along the same line. It
merely marks a beginning.
I am one of
those who believe that the worst days for the
railways are yet to come; that the railway
business is a dying one.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Except for longhaul traffic and temporary increases that occur
in the freight and passenger departments in
winter, the railway business is gradually failing. And it cannot be resuscitated. It is
the victim of new methods, just as the business of sawing wood by hand is, and the
washing of clothes by hand. Every year the
number of good highways is increasing, and
more and more motor cars and trucks are
brought into use. We sec on the roads now
trucks that for size and capacity match a
railroad freight car. If the principle of this
Bill is extended from time to time, perhaps
at the end of twenty-five years the complete
staffs of both railways. from the presidents
down, will be on some kind of dole.
I repeat that this Bill is merely a beginning.
It establishes a precedent which not only is
unsound. as bas already been pointed out,
but may lead to a burden so heavy as to be
beyond our resources. That is an aspect I
dlo net like. If the Bill is put to a vote,
I shall be quite willing to vote against it.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senaI am afraid that developments, net in
Canada alone, have gone a little too far for
Lis net to realize that elsewhere, at least, a
certain principle has been adopted with respect
to compensation for. railway employees who
are thrown ont of their jobs. What is the
situation? From evidence given before our
Special Railway Committee it would appear
ihat when some 120 British railway companies
were amalgamated into four groups, ahl parties
concerned-the State, the companies and the
employees-agreed that there should be some
compensation for employees whose jobs were
abolished in whole or in part. I should like
to know on what basis that compensation was

tors,

APRIL 27, 1939
arranged; whether it was done by statute or
by agreement between the employees and the
railways. Then there was the Washington
agreement, referred to in this House by the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). I asked himn whether that
was the resuit of a statute, and he said that
it was flot; that there had been an arrangement between the companies and the men.
So far we in this country have not attempted
to declare *by statute what shouid he the
relationship as between specific employers
and employees, cither as to wages or compensation, under any speciai conditions.
My position is, briefiy, this. I agree that
in the situation which bas arisen in Canada
there is ground for giving employees what
might be regarded as reasonable compensation, but until we have more evidence as to
the attitude of both the companies and the
employees concerned I must take the stand
that the matter is largely, if not entirely, one
for settiement between them. What did Sir
Edward Beatty say? He said, without any
equivocation, that if the railways were unified
the question of compensation would be deait
with.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

By statute?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. He said that
would be a matter of agreement between the
Government and the companies.
Hon. Mr. KING:

And that it could be

Hon. Mr. CALDER: And that it could
be taken care of. We are attempting to do
by statute now what should be a matter of
agreement by the Government-as representing the Canadian National Railways-the
Canadian Pacifie Railway and the employees
of both companies. What evidence have we
that the proposais contained in this Bill are
satisfactory to, anybody?
How were these
figures arrived at? Where did they corne
from? We have no evidence about these things
at ail. We do not knoWv whetber the matter
bas been considered or discussed by the parties
who would be chiefly affected. We as a Senate
are asked to give second reading to the Bill
without any of that information before us.
I arn opposed to, our doing so. Wbile I agree
with the principie of compensation, my view
is that the matter deait wjth in this Bill is
very largely, if flot entirely. one that should
bc. settied b-etween the railway cornpanies and
their ernployees, on a basis satisfactory to
tbem, not necessarily to the Senate.
I repeat that we do not know anything about
the matter. We are unaware bow the figures
were arrived at. Unless it is understood that
the Bill will be sent to a committee. where

257

the necessary information could be obtained,
why should we be asked to consent to second
reading and approve the principle of the
measure? I cannot do that in the circumstances.
Hon. ]RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honour-.
able senators, I wilI deal first with the iast
point mentioned ýby my honourable friend
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). If the
Bill is given second reading, and if honourable members desire to send it to our Railway
Comrnittee, I shall ask representatives of the
railways to, be present there in order tbat we
may obtaîn their views, as well as those of
experts fromn tbe Department of Railways, wbo
decided upon the figures that are contained in
the measure.
I will now attempt to answer, s0 far as I
can, the criticisms made by honourable members against the principie of the Bill. I draw
attention to the table contained in tbe
sehedule, on page 3. There it is shown bow
the period during which pensions would be
paid is determined by the em.ploy-ee-s' iengtb
of service. For instance, an empioyee wbose
length of service was one year and lema than
two years would receive a monthly salary
for six months.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Would it not be
sixty per cent of the montbly salary?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sixty per cent.

Yes, it would be

Section 4 of tbe sehedule, on page 5 of the
Bill, provides:
An employee whô is eligible to receive an
adjustnient allowance under paragraph 2 of
this sehedule rnay, at his option, to be exercised
within thirty days after the effective date of
an y such ineasure, plan or arrangement, resign
and (in lieu of an adjustrnent allowance and ahI
other benefits andi protections provided in this
sehedule) accept in a lump sum a separation
allowance determined iii accordance with the
following table:
Separation

1 year andl less than 2 years..
3 months' pay
2 years and less than 3 years

15 years and over.. .. ....
.... 2months'pay
One month's psy shahl be computed by multiplying by 30 the daily rate of pay applicable
to the position last occupied prior to the date
of the measure, plan or arrangement.
As was pointed out by my bonourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbacb),
it is the junior employces wbo will be laid
off first, to make way. for their senior colleagues who are gradually moved down the
scale. In other words, tbe men laid off will
be those with tbe least number of montbs' or

years' service; so the charge upon the railways will not be as heavy as if among the
employees laid off there were a considerable
number of men with more or less lengthy
seniority. I am not in a position to give
figures upon this point at the moment, but
this is information which could be asked for
and received by the committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think most of
these junior men will have service of around
ten or twelve years. You see, below them
again is a great fringe of men who are not
entitled to compensation, because they have
not been permanent employees, having been
taken on only for short periods every now
and then.
It is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
younger men who will be forced out, as they
are replaced by employees senior to them.
It will mean
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
that in time there will be no young men in
the railway service at all. We shall be waited
on in the dining car by greybeards, and in
the chair car hy Uncle Toms, with nearoctogenarians all over the system.
But I would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
remind my honourable friend that according
to evidence given before the Special Railway Committee the necessary attrition over
a period of five ycars would be such as gradually to require the bringing back of all these
mon into the service.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask my
honourable friend what caused the Government to act in this instance? Did the management of the Canadian National request-Will my honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend allow me to proceed, and postpone his question till I have finished? As I
have said, it will be the younger men, those
at the bottom of the ladder, who will be laid
off as their senior colleagues are demoted.
But, if we are to accept the evidence given
before the committee, natural attrition will
make necessary the gradual recall to the service of all these men who are laid off.
The Railway A3t, Chapter 170 of the Revised Statutes, 1927, makes the following provision with respect to compensation of employees who are moved by a railway from
one place to another. Section 179 says:
The company shall not, at any time, make any
change, alteration or deviation in the railway,
or any portion thereof, until the provisions of
the last preceding section are fully complied
with, nor remove, close, or abandon any station,
or divisional point nor create a new divisional
point which would involve the removal of
employees, without leave of the Board; and
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

where any such change is made the company
shall compensate its employees as the Board
deems proper for any financial loss caused to
them by change of residence necessitated
thereby.
It will be seen that the Railway Act already
imposes upon railway companies the principle
of compensating employees who may be
affected by any change, alteration or deviation
of their lines.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But we have never
attempted to fix that compensation by statute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; but the
Railway Act imposes that obligation upon the
railways.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act of 1933
does not impose a condition, but declares, by
clause 16:
The National Company, for and on behalf of
itself, . . . and the Pacifie Company, for and
on behalf of itself . . . are . . . directed to

attempt forthwith to agree and continuously
to endeavour to agree, and they respectively
are, for and on behalf as aforesaid, authorized
to agree, upon such co-operative measures, plans
and arrangements as are fair and reasonable
and best adapted . . . to effect such purposes.

Then this follows:
They are further directed that whenever they
shall so agree they shall endeavour to provide
through negotiations with the representatives
of the employees affected, as part of such
measure, plan or arrangement or otherwise, for
a fair and reasonable apportionment as between
the employees of National Railways and Pacifie
Railways, respectively, of such employment as
may be incident to the operation of such
measure, plan or arrangement.
It will be seen that Parliament was thinking
of the men who might be laid off and whose
positions would be affected.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The railway companies
never did anything under that direction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As a matter of
fact, since 1933, lines have been abandoned
and pooling arrangements made, but men have
been laid off without any compensation
whatever.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Do I understand that
the Act of 1933 contains a direction to the
railway companies that where savings were
effected through co-operation they should
provide reasonable and suitable compensation
for the men affected?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The word used
I
is "apportionment," not "compensation."
will read the last few lines again:
-- shall endeavour to provide, . . . for a fair
and reasonable apportionment as between the
employees of National Railways and Pacifie

APRIL 27, 1939
Railways, respectively, of sucli employment as
may be incident to the operation of sucli
measure, plan or arrangement.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is ail
riglit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was an
attempt to estalblish a rule by which those
employees who might, for instance, lie affected
by a pooling arrangement should be transferred
to such other employment as could be offered.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By arrangement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act did not
go to the extent of directing that those men
should be given a bonus or compensation.
As I stated when I moved the second
reading, a similar situation as between the
carriers and the employees in the United
States liad to be considered, and they entered
into. the agreement which appears in Senate
Hansard. This Bill is virtually on the same
lines.
Riglit Hon. Mr. ýMEIGHEN: But one is an
agreement and the other is legisiation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of the House to this fact. Parliament, representing the shareholders of the
Cranadian National Railways, bas deeided
to give compensation to the men wlio may
in future be laid off by the abandonment of
lines under the Act of 1933. My riglit lionourable friend speaks of the beavy burden
that the country is already carrying, and
wonders whether it is proper to compensate
those men at present, wben we are proceeding
under an Act of Parliament to abandon lines
or organize pooling arrangements. I miglit
join issue on tbis point and say that if those
mnen in the present condition of the country
are laid off and given no compensation wbatever, the State will have to give tbemn help in
another form.
1 corne now to the principal point of my
right bonourable friend's argument: even if
we, the sharebolders of the Canadian National,
the people of Canada, should put our bands
into, our pockets and give those men compensation, by wbat riglit do we impose a
similar obligation, upon the Canadian Pacific?
My bonourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) lias brought up the very point I
intend ta make now. Sir Edward Beatty
declared in very clear terms ta the men of
the Canadian Pacifie, lis employees,! that tliey
would be taken care of under bis plan of
unification. Now, I wonder-and I arn ready
to, put the question to bim. if we go into
committee-wliat distinction he makes between
the treatment ta be accorded the men who
71498--171

wvill be laid off under co-operation, that is,
under joint action by the Canadian Pacifie
and the Canadian National, and their treatment under the obligation he assumes towards

tbemn in the case of unification. Is this the
bait lie offered in order ta, secure their support of bis plan for unification? I do flot
know. 1 simply accept bis declaration tliat
lie binds bimself ta take care of lis cmployees under unification. However, we are
now under another plan; we are under the Act
of 1933, which directs the two railways to
proceed by co-operative measures. It is not
unification
nor
amalgamnation,
but cooperation up to a point.
Wbat was the purpose of the Act of 1933?
Was it not to try to bring about sucb
arrangements between the two railways as
wouhd produce economies to their mutual
advantage? Surely that is the essential reason
for that legishation. Are the employees of
each railway system ta, be treated. differently
by the Canadian National or the Canadian
Pacific because tbey lose their jobs under tbat
Act and not under the plan of Sir Edward
Beatty? 1 do not know whether lie will ever
attain bis end in the campaign lie lias been
carrying on for unification, but I know one
thing: we are seeking to amend the Act of
1933 in order to, try to liring himn under the
very obligation wicli lie lias assumed towards those of bis employees who would lose
their jobs under unification.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICiHEN: The honourable member's argument is: if a man says
that under one condition in a business lie is
running lie is prepared to do a certain thing,
sucb a statement gives Parliament the right
to compel him to do the same thing under
other conditions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 would draw
my rigbt bonoura.ble friend's attention to a
document which perbaps bas escaped bis
notice.
It is dated Montreal, November 15,
1938, and is signed by Sir Edward Beatty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I bave not
seen it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 will read it:
To General Chairmen of Emphoyees' Committees
and AIl Employees:
In view of the increasing publie interest in
the very clear necessity for some solution of
the railway problem, and my own genuine belief
that steps to rationalize the situation are at
least as necessary in the interests of railway
workers as in the interests of the Treasury, and
that of railway investors, I behieve that it might
lie timehy for me to repeat, and perhaps extend,
some remarks whicli f hiave ahready made on
this point.
In evidence before a Special Committee of
the Senate of Canada, sitting hast spring, I
sbowed that, in the first place, the statements

260
260

SENATE
SENATE

which are circulated, to the effect that unified
management would involve the displacement
frein employment of 25,000 or 30,000 men, are
entirely incorrect. As I told the Senate Committee: "I may point out the arithmetical fact
that the annual turnover of railway labour on
the Canadian Pacifie is almost 5 per cent. Each
year almost 5 per cent of our employees die,
retire, seek other employment, or leave the
service for other reasons. The total savings
of labour under unification are estimated at
15 per cent to 17 per cent. Thus, assuming that
the labour situation on the Canadian National
System is approxinately the same as on the
Canadian Pacifia, we eau sea that, in the five
years, at least, which will be required to accomplisi unification, a policy of net hiring additional workers would reduce the staffs of the
two railway systems more than the savings of
unification would involve."
In answer to a question by Senator Haig to
me when I was giving evidence before the
Senate Committee on Tuesday, May 24, I made
the following reply:
"Of course you appreciate, Senator, that
attrition goes on every year. That attrition will
take care of more employees than we could
ordinarily do without under the unification system. But we know that these men do net all
retire at the same time, nor in the same perFor instance, a

would take more than five years tî absorb that.
in this
But it is net a very serions problei,
way: the railways have three ways of meeting
mien imay
it--they can reduce the age at which
voluntarily retire, from 65 to 60; tiey mnay do
as was done in the United States. provide for
an allowance to a man, graded on his service,
over a period of years: or they could simiply
extend the period within which the maximum
economy shall be secured. The last inentioned
method would be the simusplest of all. It night
mean, for example, that we coild not reach the
full savings for seven years. I Nouibl not worry
about that, if it meant that tiere would be no
dislocation of labour; the only changes being
made by those who voluntarily' retire froi the
services, or die, or retire under the pen.sion rules
of the company. I have given this part of the
subject a great deal of consideration, because I
realized that what you said is truc. as to the
general feeling, and I also realized tie unfairness to the men who becane railroaders because
they thougit that railroad service offered a
fair opportunity for a livelihood. and who have
had nothing to do with the conditions that
brought about this situation which we are viewing to-day. So J am prepared te go very far
in meeting that human deanad arising out of
this situation. The British handled the matter
in one way; the Americans did it in another.
The British simply said that no man with more
than five years' experience should be demoted
or discharged in consequence of the consolidation. It took them quite a long while to svork
it out over there, but they are doing it and
they have benefited from it, and labour is very
well satisfied."

labour, confirming any agreement reached by
negotiaition between the employees and the
railway companies at the time of unification.
It is clear thalt, in other countries, it has
been found possible to formulate specific forms
of protection for the interests of labour when
ineasures are adopted te eliminate duplication
of railway facilities and services. In view of
the certainty that unification vill be adopted
in Canada, sooner or later, is it not advisable
for us to take into consideration the methods
which should be used to ensure that the interests of labour do net suffer in this eventuality?
My own feeling is very strong that, whether
you like unification or wiether, like myself,
and all tie officers of the Canadian Pacifia
Railway, you regard it as un-fortunate that we
must have iit, but understand that it must
come. tie wise program would be, in the interest of all parties concerned, for you to study
how it cau 'be accomplished, while full protection of the interest of labour is maintained.
J have pointed out that arrangements for
this purpose cannot be initiated b>' the Canadian Pacifie Railway, since we are talking of a
program which would involve two railway
managements, and, on the whole, one great
grousp of workers. That is, if provision for
the protection of labour under unification is to
be made, without leaving it to be done whenpossibly in some great national crisis-unificatien suddenly comes about, the initiative in
undertaking the study of how this protection
could be provided must. as far as I can see,
come from yen.
It will ba quite easy for a study of tiis
subject te. be made, without your feeling in
the least that interest in it. and a desire to
protect your interests under unification, autonsatically commit you to accepting the policy.
In so many words, I am not asking you to
say that yeu are in favour of unification. I
am .asking you to consider how unification could
be accompilisied without damage to your interests.
As I have said. I cannot commit the Government, which represents the owners of the
Canadian National Railways, to any detailed
arrangement. I kiow, however, that the Canýadian Government will never be a party to any
arrangement which does not give fair protection to workers. The Canadian Pacifie stand L
have expressed very plainly. Only from the
worlkers can there be obtained a definite statement of what they think they should obtain
in the way of protection.
One of the thrae ways I suggested might be
adopted, or there might in effect be a combination of them. It could be provided that
employee eligible for pension might, volinsany
tarily ani of his own initiative, retire on
reaching sixty years of age .instead of sixtyfive. In the case of the British amalgamation
a statute was passed providing that any
employee with more than five years' service
could not have his position made worse as a
result of the amalgamation, and generally
employees could be fully protected in such an
arrangement simply by extending the term during which economies would be effected, if it
were necessary to do so. No doubt in some
cases employees net eligible for pension or who
iad net reached the age of sixty years might
desire to enter some other occupation than

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn ready to

any compensation to its employees under the
Act of 1933, 1 may, after consulting the Minister who has handed me this Bill. withdraw
it as regards the Canadian Pacific Railway.
In closing, I simply wvant te seund a note
of cheer for my honeurable friend from

the railway industry is a dying industry. I

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -but our railway system covers se much territory that it

the future of the railways. They wvill survive
by getting togethier and ce-operating as closely
as possible with a view te reducing expenditure-if the Canadian Pacifie dees net get

Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Henourable
senaters, I arn certainly at a less te follew the
remarks that have fallen from the lips of the
leader of the Gevernment. Time and tirne
again the Minister of Transport, Hon. Mr.
Howe. has said the Gevernment do net
interfere with the Canadian National Railways, and that the management of the road
is in the hands of the board of directors, the
president and the officers. A short time ago
Mr. Murdock resigned frern the board. When
the Minister was questioned about that incident he said, "Neither myself nor the Government interfere with the management of the
Canadian National Railways."
Hon. Mr. KING:
by Mr. Murdock.

And that was cenfirmed

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Now we have
the Government placing befere us the Bill
under discussion. If the Gevernment wanted
te interfere with the management of the
Canadian National, as apparently they do, it
seerns te me the first step weuld have been
for the Minister te write the manager or
president of the Canadian National saying
that hie theught the empleyees referred te
in the Biil eught te be compensated, and te
the Canadian Pacifie Railway te see if sorne
agreement ceuld net be reachcd. By doing
that the M-inister weuld have progressed a
long way. But instead the Goverement have
breught down this Bill. I repeat a question
which 1 asked the leader of the Government

National management ask for it?
If se,
would the proper course not bave been for
the Goveroment to reply te the management
that this was a matter which should be dealt
with by the two railways? I amn strengly of
opinion that that sheuld have been done.
This Bill should neyer have cerne befere Parliarnent at aIl, honeurable senaters. We know
that this year is, or is likely te be, a rernarkable one, and I believe that is the sole
reasen wvhy the Bill was intreduced.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Six o'clock.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We could perhaps give it the second reading now.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand that if
second reading is carried it will net mean that
any one of us is cemrnitted te the main
principle of the Bill at this tirne, the object
being simply to get the Bill into committee.
The only purpese of the measure is compensation for the employees concernied. We
may agree that compensation sheuld be given
in one way or anether, but we cannot vote
on the prînciple involved here until we have
more information.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is quite right in stating- that though
agreeing te the second reading we shaîl be
free te divide the Senate on the question of
third reading, and te, vote against the Bill
if we se desire.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Do I understand that, if second reading is agreed te, the

DRAWN

'The Senate resured front Wednesday,
April 26, the adjourned debate on the motion
for the second reading of Bill 02, an Act to
amend the Fariers' Creditors Arrangement
Act, 1934.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, wvhen this Bill was before ns
last Wednesday for second reading I stated
I had a vague recollection that I had been
given the reason why the Act should continue in operation as respects farmers who are
soldier settlers within the neaning of the
Soldier Settlement Act. Accordingly I then
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

moved an adjournment of the debate, as I
deemed it advisable that, before agreeing to
the principle of the Bill, which wipes out
completely any recourse returned soldiers
could have to the Act, I should be duly
informed on the subject and transmit the
information to honourable members.
I am advised that this was the reason for
continuing the Act in favour of returned soldiers:
The Soldier Settlement Act was amended on
March 21, 1938, providing for continuance of
the bonus plan of dollar for dollar until March
31. 1941, on arrears of record as of March 31,
1938. In other words, bonus on current instalments maturing after March 31, 1938, was discontinued. The general basis upon whieh this
amendment was enacted was:
1. That a large number of settlers had at
that tine succeeded in having their accounts
fully paid up to date, and it was believed this
group did not require any additional aid.
2. That a larger number of settlers were not
taking advantage of the bonus plan.
Under that plan the settler was credited
dollar for dollar in respect of any arrears he
might pay.
This was evidenced by arrears of approximately $12,000,000 standing against these
accounts, and accordingly some other action
had to be proposed whereby these accounts
eould be restored to a state of solvency.
The greatest problem of course existed in the
Western

Provinces, where the great

bulk

of

Soldier Settlement business is located, and where
agricultural conditions have been difficult for
several years.

When the amendment was under discussion
in the House the Minister indicated that soldier
settlers whose affairs were not in a solvent
state should seek an adjustment of their accounts
under the provisions of the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act.

I inquired of the Honourable Minister of
Finance whetlher it was not time to termin-

ate the Act completely in the Central and
Maritime Provinces. I have pleasure in informing the sponsor of this Bill (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) that I have received .the following
letter from the Minister:
Dear Senator Dandurand:
In response to your request an inquiry has

been made of the Director of Soldier Settlement,
who informs me that there remain only a very
smiall nunber of soldier settlers in the provinces
of Ontario. Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island who would be
entitled to benefit under the provision of section 11. subsection 3 of the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, and for that reason the
authority provided under section 20 of the said
Act will be exercised in such manner that no
iiew proposal shall be made or filed by any
farmer, including farmers -who are soldier
settlers within the rneaning of the Soldier
Settlement Act. in the provinces of Quebec,
Npýew
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island later than the 10th of May, 1939,
and in the province of Ontario, later than the
30th of May, 1939.

APRIL 28, 1939
It is necessary to give some additional time
in the province of Ontario, as there are a large
iiumber of soldier settlers in the category referred to in that province, al of whom must
be given notice of the termination of this
privilege.
The Act will be extinguished completely in
the eastern provinces, from Quebec down to
Prince Edward Island, on the lth of May,
less than two weeks from now, and in Ontario
on the 30th of May. The clause under which
the Minister of Finance may take action is
clause 20 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, which reads:
On and after a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council, no new
proposai shall be made or filed by any farmer
or accepted by any Official Receiver in any
province in respect of which the said proclamation is issued.
I have the official statement of the Minister
of Finance that an Order in Council will put
an end to this Act in the provinces I have
indicated.
Under these conditions, I would suggest to
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
that he withdraw his Bill. The Act will
continue in existence with respect to the
Western Provinces, but it will remain with
the Minister of Finance to decide, after
examining the situation there, whether they
should not be similarly treated.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: It is my duty, I
presume, to say that under these circumstances,
my honourable leader's suggestion being a
compromise, I will accept it. I should like,
however, to make a short explanation, occupying not more than five minutes, I hope.
On Wednesday last the leader of the House
said that if the figures of expenditure given
by my colleague on my left (Hon. Mr.
MacArthur) and myself were approximately
correct he would support this Bill. I have
here the proof of their accuracy, and for the
information of the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) and the other members of
the Senate, and particularly the Minister of
Finance, I should like to make this explanation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ance has been cured.

But the griev-

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It will be cured in
about two weeks. Notwithstanding that fact,
I should like to pass the information on,
because it will do -no harm, and it may do
some good in regard to other features of the
Act.
I have here figures to show that the expenditure on Prince Edward Island. for instance,
for the fiscal year 1936-37 was exceedingly
large in comparison with that of the other
provinces. I do not want to read all the

figures. We have not received those for 1938,
because, as honourable senators know, the
fiscal year ends on the 31st of March, and
there has been no time for the department
to make up a report; but the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
put a question on the Order Paper, which
was answered on the 5th of April, as to the
expenditures under the official receivers for
the nine months of 1938. The answer shows
that for the nine months of 1938 the expenditures in Prince Edward Island were more than
twice as much as they had been for the
previous twelve months. Now, this is the
initiation of the business, and if expenditure
under other heads is in proportion, the total
will be more than twice as much as it was
for the whole of 1936-1937. The operation of
the Act in Prince Edward Island is a racket.
Every effort is made to get farmers to make
applications. Men who do not want to apply
at all are induced to do so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Were induced.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Were induced. It
is that kind of thing I should like to have
called to the attention of the Minister of
Finance and the department, because I am
sure they would not approve of it.
Now I will quote just one or two figures for
1937, and then I shall be satisfied to let the
matter stand.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What is the honourable gentleman quoting from?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: From the Auditor
General's report, as quoted in this paper. I
vouch for the accuracy of the quotation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

What paper?

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Charlottetown
Guardian.
According to the Auditor General's report
for the fiscal year ending in March, 1937, the
official receiver in Prince Edward Island was
paid $2,400 as salary and $1,750 for assistance
and office expenses. But in Nova Scotia, a
much larger province, with two and a half
times as many farmers, the official receiver
was paid just half as much in salary, $1,200,
and only $5 for office expenses. In New
Brunswick, where there are three times as
many farmers as in Prince Edward Island,
and, I suppose, three times as much business,
the salary was $2,400, but the office expenses
were only $1,003.87, just a little more than
half of those allowed for Prince Edward
Island. Other figures for the three provinces,
which I have not taken time to quote, are
about in proportion.

SENATE
I wanted to give that information to the
honourable leader of the House, because I
knew he would not approve of what was being
done. And I do not think it would meet with
the approval of any honourable member, except one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I acted promptly
after the statement of my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Hughes), and I understand he is
now going to withdraw his Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I should like to ask
a question of the honourable leader of the
When this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Act terminates in the Maritime Provinces,
on May 10, will all the expenses cease? For
example, will the official receivers continue to
be paid their salaries, or will these payments
be stopped?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope they will
be stopped. I shall ask the Minister of
Finance to look into the question of continuing
expenses.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I can answer the
question asked by the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black). It will
be remembered that I pointed out previously
that the Act is dead, but not buried. That
situation will not be changed. Although
applications will not be receivable after May
10, the boards will continue to function indefinitely. When it began to appear that the
Act might be terminated, after my questions
had been put on the Order Paper and answers
received, hundreds of applications came in.
These have still to be dealt with. Rentals
and other expenses will likely go on, although
the officials may be ashamed by now and
cut down a little. But we want the whole
thing ended.
The thing I am complaining about now is
that this Act was made a hybrid affair, applicable not only to ordinary farmers, but to
soldier settlers. Returned soldiers should
never have been linked up with the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. We all know
that the intention of this Act was to keep
good farmers on the land, but that was not
the effect of it at all. When the Director was
before our committee last year a concrete case
was cited by the honourable gentleman from
Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), whom I
do not see in the Chamber at the moment.
The honourable gentleman asked the Director,
"Do you say that man was insolvent?" And
the answer was, "Certainly." The right honourable leader on the other side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) was there and his comment
was: "No wonder there is maladministration
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

in Prince Edward Island. That man was not
insolvent at all." The administration down
there was just legalized robbery, and farmers
were using the Act as an excuse to get clear
of paying their bills.
However, the principal point I want to
emphasize right now is that it was a mistake
to confuse soldier settlers with ordinary
farmers. That was not necessary at all, and
the proviso inserted in the Act last year was
not good legislation. The soldier settlers are
in a different class altogether from ordinary
farmers.
I seconded the motion of my honourable
colleague from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
for second reading of the present Bill. If he
desires to withdraw the Bill, I consent.
With leave, the Bill was withdrawn.
SMALL LOANS BILL
CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS AMENDMENT

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved concurrence in the amendment made by the
House of Commons to Bill Z, an Act respecting Small Loans.
He said: Honourable senators, it will be
remembered that when we pa.ssed this Bill
and sent it to the House of Commons we
left a blank where section 10 should have
been, in order that the Commons might
insert there a money clause, which we could
not initiate in this Chamber. The Bill has
now been returned to us, and the only
amendment is the insertion of this clause 10.
Honourable members will find the wording on
page 144 of our Minutes. It reads:
10. The Superintendent shall annually cause
an assessment to be prepared against each
licensee under this Act for the purpose of
meeting the expense incurred by the Government for or in connection with the administration of this Act, and the provisions of sections
six and eight of The Department of Insurance
Act, chapter forty-five of the statutes of 1932,
shall mutatis mutandis apply in the case of
every such licensee to the same extent as if
the title of this Act were inserted in the
Schedule to The Department of Insurance Act.
The motion was agreed to.
GRAIN FUTURES BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce on Bill 81, an
Act to provide for the supervision and regulation of Trading in Grain Futures.
The motion was agreed to.

APRIL 28, 1939
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I am not a member of the Banking and Commerce Committee, but I was present for a
short time at the sitting when this Bill was
being considered. I understand that all parties
concerned in the Act, that is the trade, the
farmers' organizations, the department, the
grain commissioners, and so on, are reasonably
satisfied with the amendments that have been
made. So I do not think there is any objection
to third reading being given now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should not like
to assure the Minister who handled this Bill
before the House of Commons that all parties
concerned are satisfied with every amendment.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At all events,
the Bill as amended will be returned to the
House of Commons. I have some doubt as to
one slight amendment. The word "endeavour"-

Hon. Mr. BLACK:
make."

"Shall endeavour to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it runs,
"shall exert its best endeavour to obtain certain information." However, we will return
the Bill in its amended form to the House
of Commons.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

STATE OF CANADA'S DEFENCE
DISCUSSION

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the state of the defence of Canada.
He said: Honourable members, in addressing
this House a few days ago on the Defence
Purchasing Board Bill I said that either we
were on the verge of a great war or we had
already entered into a world condition in
which the relationships between nations would
be based upon armed strength. I should add
to this statement that wars in the future will
probably take place between great alliances
of states and the matter of the armed strength
of the states composing such alliances is a
matter of concern to all of them.
In days gone by, it was left to the dignity,
pride, sincerity and self-respect of each nation
in the alliance to determine what its contributions would be. Nowadays military strength
is a matter of negotiation and agreement and
of common concern to the whole alliance.
We have seen an example of this in the past
month. Great Britain and France united to
form a bloc of nations to stop Hitler. At
once the French demanded undertakings from
Britain, and Britain agreed to contribute an
expeditionary force of thirty-two divisions to
serve on the continent of Europe or elsewhere.
Then Great Britain and France offered protection to Poland and Rumania and asked for
the co-operation of Russia. These states, in
effect, said: "We will not commit ourselves to
this bloc until we are satisfied that Great
Britain can effectually intervene on land in our
particular areas." The result has been the
adoption of conscription in Great Britain.
We in Canada are, if you like, in alliance
with the other states in the Commonwealth.
We are, through Great Britain, in alliance with
all those states which have determined to
stand up to and resist the dictatorial powers.
The condition of our armed forces, therefore,
is not only a matter of national concern, but
concerns all our friends and allies and involves
as well considerations of 'our dignity, our
sincerity and our self-respect. If, while declating our solidarity with and support oi

268

SENATE

democratic ideals, religious and political
liberty and the like, we neglect or refuse te
support our protestations with the armed forces
which make our adherence worth while, we are
likely to be held up to the contempt and
ridicule of the whole world. Later I shall
discuss our relations with the United States
in this.regard.
The defence of "Canada alone " has never
been a sound policy. Ministers of the Government are fond of quoting from the resolution
of the Imperial Conference of 1923 which says
that the first duty of a component part of the
Commonwealth is to provide for its own
defence. They seldom quote a subsequent
clause which ends with the words, "until
support arrives from the outside." A few days
ago the Minister of Justice did quote these
latter words, but drew no inference from them.
From where does anyone suppose this help
will come? From Great Britain, primarily.
But it is also conceivable that it might come
from Australia, or New Zealand or South
Africa. If Great Britain is thus obligated to
help us in time of trouble, is there no
mutuality in this agreement?
Having regard to modern weapons,- modern
methods and present-day conditions, I contend that the defence of Canada is best
conducted at a distance from Canada, and the
greater the distance the better. The devastations of whole cities, indeed of whole countrysides, in France and Belgium in the late war
point to the common sense of this view. Shall
we sit, then, within our dwn borders while the
Commonwealth is defeated in detail? Shall
we wait until Great Britain is conquered and
reduced to the status of a second-rate power,
and then fall victim to the conqueror?
Then we are told that the United States will
protect us. If the United States ever protects
us actively, it will be at a price which may
cost us our sovereignty and autonomy. We
are told that the President of the United
States last year said that the United States
would not stand idly by if domination of our
soil was threatened. We should inquire into
the reason for the President's speech. Shortly
before making this speech he was told by his
military advisers that the defenceless condition of Canada was a menace to the United
States; that it was conceivable that after the
defeat of Great Britain in a world war, or
before that event, in certain cireumstances,
hostile forces might invade Canada, establish
themselves in this country and thereafter
strike at the industrial areas of the United
States. To the students of war the speech of
the President meant that, with or without our
request or consent, the United States will
prevent a foreign foe fron establishing himself
in Canada for the purpose of attacking the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

United States, and that is precisely the quality
or nature of and reason for the assistance
which the United States will give us.
Then I notice that the Minister of National
Defence, in his speech the other day, spoke of
the protection which we seem to have a right
to expect from the United States navy. If
France and Great Britain are at war with
Germany and Italy, and the United States is
neutral, and a German cruiser breaks through
the British cordon and approaches Halifax for
the purpose of destroying our shipping and
bombarding that place, does anyone suppose
that any American warship which happens to
be in the neighbourhood will intervene on our
behalf? That is a suggestion without any
foundation in fact or reason.
It boils down to this. Canada is a part of
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
A
British Commonwealth triumphant in war
means an inviolate Canada. A defeated British
Commonwealth means dire peril for Canada.
In another place, this session. we have heard
members of Parliament say that they would
not serve outside of Canada, but would enter
the tronches in Canada to defend Canada.
When it comes to that it will be too late.
I find it difficult to plumb the mentality of
men who cannot understand that the place
to defend Canada is as far from Canada as
we can do it. If it is to be donc effectually,
we must develop an armament industry in
Canada and equip ourselves; we must adopt
the conception of a united Commonwealth,
and must not shrink from any of the implications whieh that involves; and, just as we
expect to be assisted by the CQmmonwealth
when we are in danger, so we must be prepared to give aid not only to our partners in
the Commonwealth, but to all those democratie
states with which we are in moral alliance to
defend the liberties of the world. We cannot
defend Canada, we cannot make war, upon a
limited liability basis.
. Now I come to diseuss the speech made by
the Minister of National Defence in another
place the other day. The speech of the Minister of National Defence runs to terrific
wordage, soume fourteen pages of Hansard.
There are needless tables and statistics, and
much irrelevant matter which may be discarded as 'padding."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is treading on prohibited ground.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not think
so. I was careful to refer to the speech as
having been delivered in another place, whieh
is the parliamentary subterfuge, and I was
proceeding to prove the lack of value of the

MAY 1, 1939
statistics given. If there is any objection to
describing that as "padding," -you may cal!
it anything else you like.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is answering a speech delivered in the
other Blouse.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Well, we could
have no discussion in Canada if there were
no ineans whereby speeches made in the other
House could be taken cognizance of here,
and so long as I rcfcr to them as having been
delivered in "another place" I avoid the
accusation which my honourable friend levels
at me. I think that is the accepted understanding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not exactly. 1
could tell the honourable gentleman how ta
get around the difficulty. He has not got
around it yet.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should be delighted if the honourable gentleman would do
sa. I have observed that hie has succeeded
in reading and criticizing speeches made in
the other House. I insist that for the purpose of public discussion it is necessary that
there should be a confliet of minds on this
matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Unfortunately
the gentleman to whom my honourable friend
refers is nat here to answer hjm.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Quite sa. Neithýer
%vasI in the other House to answer him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I arn sorry
for the other Buse.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I think al
honourable members have heard the leader of
the Government quate speeches delivered in
another place in support of the argument he
was making at the time. If he could do that,
why cannot my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grieshach) do so?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a distinction. When I present a hi!! which emanates from the Government, I can bring in a
memorandum explaining and justifying the
bill; and the best way I can do that is to
cite' the words af the honourable Minister
who introduced' the bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) will
be quite in order if hie amits the Minister's
narne and just refers to a speech made in
another place.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The point of order is
a very interesting one. I have neyer before
seen it raised in just this way. It would be

-26Ç

a queer state of affairs if, when one of the
Ministers of the Crown made a statement
on a miatter of policy, we in this House had
no right ta consider the .policy announced
by the Minister. What would be the result?
Our mouths would be closed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think there
is a clear statement in the rules of the SenateHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quote it, please.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -that prohibits
a member af this Chamber from making
any allusion or reference ta, or any criticismn
or attack on, a member of the other Chamber,
and vice versa. The purpose af the rule is
ta prevent any clash hetween the two Chambers. When a statement is made in the Cainmons, if it were permissible ta criticize it
in the Senate and then ta answer the criticism
in the other Chamber, there would be na
end ta the matter. It is unseemly that such
a discussion should occur between the two
Chambers. That is the reason why the rule
says there shaîl be no allusian ta the discussian in the ather Huse.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I amn referring ta
a speech made in "anather place." I think
that should be satisfactary.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I once faund
it convenient ta quote Hansard of "where
the Minister spoke."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is, first,
a statement by the Minister as ta the candition,
of aur defence farces as hie found them in
1935. Apparently aIl the weaknesses and insufficiencies were laid befare him. He therefore
divests himself af any excuse for ignorance
of aur real condition. In 1936, 1937 and 1938
the estimates for national defence were sormewhat mare than doubled, and in that period
he had the expenditure aI some ninety millions aI dollars. His statement then sets out
what has been accomplished and what is propased. It is ta be noted particularly that the
statemient covers a period af nearly four
years. 50 that we have before us in arcamplishment what represents four years of

endeavour on the part of the Government.
On taking office in 1935 the Government
were aware of the threat of the dictatorial
powers ta the liberties of the world. In 1936

Great Britain began her program aI rearmament on a gigantie scale. Throughout the
whole 'period the newspapers bave been fihled
with descriptions of the Herculean efforts of
the British people ta arm themselves in time.
In the period fromn 1936 ta 1938 factories
were canstructed in England, whîeh went into
production, and the equipment which they
produced has been in the bands of British
soldiers now for months. We have therefore

270

SENATE

before us the resuits of a vigorous armament
policy.carried out by a Goverroment which
meant business fromn the start.
What hav e the Goverrnment of Canada done
in the period under discussion? WTe arc told
that coast dcfences have been erected on the
Atlantic and on the Pacifie coasts. The Minister rather slurrcd ox er the quality of the
armament jnstallcd and the nature of searchlights and uptical and electrical apparatus which
appertain to toast defence. We arc further
tuld of an incrc ase ini the warlike stores, and
of the breath-taking fact that xvc hav e acquired
five mortars and three anti-aircraft guns and
our Air Force now hias thiirty-six front-line
planes. We are stili prox ided with the artillery
used in the late war, now ubsolete and must
of it worn out, and se, far as can be learned
nu prov ision is being made for the re-equipment of our artillery. Our artillery is stili
hursc-drawn, with a radius of twenty miles a
day. No provision lias been made for artillery tractor.. which, if our artillery were given
ruhhor tires, would hav e a radius of twenty
muiles an hour. Our only hope of light machine
guns is tu be found in the Bren gun contract.
Tixere hias heen no increase in the strength of
our land forces, and no improvement in the
training. The position of our land forces is
precisely what it ivas surne ten years ago.
As an evidence of the forcsight and acumen
of the Gox ernment it is said that they have
adupted thie system of gix ing priurity first tu
the Air Force. second to the Navy and third
tu the Army. While it is the duty of the
Guverninent to maintain these three arms of
the service in pruper proportion, the idea of
priority, so far as Canada is cuncerrned, origînates sulely in the Government's policy to
vote the smallest amount of money for the
defence of the cuuntry. The policy of priority
hias no other foundýation, and there was no0
reason xvhatever why the augmentation and
improvement of all three forces should not
have been continued at the same time, given
the nccessary voting of the money therefor.
Under the system of priority and the presenit
rate of progress we cannot expect that our
army will have made very much improvement until sume six years or more have passed.
The Guverament meroly support a "go-slow"
pulicy. The permanent force remains precisely what it was, yet ex eryone knows that
should we be called upon suddenly to augment our military forces the heaviest task
would he laid upon the permanent force. We
have some twenty hattalions that have been
reorganized as machine gun battalions. The
organizatiun is mostly on paper and the battalions are without necessary machine guas.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

We have sorne ten or twelve hattalions. reorganized as tank hattalions, and none of
them have any tanks; and we have no other
armoured fighting vechicles.
What I arn stressing niow is that this is our
condition at the end of three and a hiaîf
years of the Government's policy of rearmament.
It wa" obvious fromn the heginning that
Great J3ritain, in the throes of its own
rearmament program, could not for a number
uf years supply us with military equipment,
and that the United States for a number of
reasons v'as not available to us as a source of
supply. The inevitahie conclusion ought to
have heen that our re-equipment must come
from our own industry and our oxvn resources.
Having regard to the record of Canadian
industry in the last war, and to the developments that have taken place since, we can
confidently assert that in the matter of field
guns, in anti-aircraft guns, armoured flghting
vehicles, tractors and the like, Canadian.
industry, Canadian capital and Canadian
engineering skill are fully equal to the task of
suplying us with alI this material. Whiat was
needed three years ago and is needed now
is a Government with courage, energy and
business acumen equal tu, that of 1914-1918
and reflecting in some degree at least the
courage, skill and determînation of the great
mass of the Canadian people. llad a Government possessing these qualities heen in office
during the past three years we should to-day
have been well along with our rearmament, and
our defensive strength would have grown
month by month.
We are at this moment confronted with the
faut that we have an unemployment prohlemn
in Canada, and, curiously enough, men are
being laid off at this moment in the very
industries which should have heen engaged in
In Hamilton the
armament construction.
other day I met a group of ex-service officers
now engaged in steel work, electrical work and
general engineering construction. Every one
of themn agreed that the presenit condition of
their industries was bad, and that the inauguration of an armament industry in Canada would
make a very substantial contribution toîvards
solving the whole question of unemployment.
The Government have lacked the courage
to grapple with this situation. I think they
also lack business ahility. Still worse, there
is the feeling that the Government have
adopted a " go-slow " policy in the matter of
national defence, with the hope of gaining the
support of certain elements in this country.
I arn now told by those competent to express
an opinion on the politîcal situation that at

MAY 1, 1939
the next election the Government will not
gain a single vote from this very element
which they have been seeking to placate.
My information is that throughout this
country there is grave and growing dissatisfaction. with the policy of the Government, and
an increasing demand that the Government
shall grapple with the question of rearmament
and deal with it as it was dealt with in Great
Britain.
The statement to which I have referred as
now being before the country can be divided
into three parts: first, what the Government
found on taking office; secondly, what the
Government have done in the past four years;
and, thirdly, what the Government intend to
do, and how.
In connection with the Air Force, a bad state
of affairs was found to exist in 1935. The
personnel was weak and the equipment was
poor.
Hon. Mr. KING: Why?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It was weak
because it had been reduced by the Government.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: By the last Government.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: While they were
in office.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Generally so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Not generally so;
specifically so.
Hon. Mr. KING: Absolutely so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In the case of the
Air Force.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Only?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, that is all.
It was reduced substantially; I admit that.
Hon. Mr. KING: How many officers were
dismissed?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think some fifty
officers.
Hon. Mr. KING: Seventy-nine.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I admit all that.
But, since the subject has been raised as it
has, I might point out that no protest at all
was raised in this Parliament against the
weakening of the Air Force. And if I might
be allowed to say somethingHon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
was in this Parliament at the time.

Hon. ;Mr. GRIESBACH: And my speeches
are in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. KING: There was no protest
from the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You will find my
speeches in Hansard. I make a speech on
some aspect of national defence every year.
Some sessions I make two speeches.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: The former
Minister of Defence, Colonel Ralston, protested quite firmly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder if while
my honourable friend is on this point in his
speech he would touch upon the statement
that I have heard of as having been made in
several places, namely, that about two million
of our Canadians east of where we now stand,
and about a million and a half of our Canadians west of where we now stand, are up in
arms and very resentful because of expenditures now being made on national defence.
And it is said that a considerable number of
these people are in my honourable friend's
own province. Would he deal with that point?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. I will deal
with these points one at a time.
As to the reduction in the Air Force, I did
not approve of it. But there was no movement to oppose the Government in carrying
it out. Opposition to what was done was
principally because of the number of men who
were being let out of employment, not because of the reduction in the Air Force as a
fighting unit.
Hon. Mr. KING: The former Minister of
Defence protested, though.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As to the point
raised by the honourable gentleman from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I admit that
there is opposition to an armament policy.
From the political point of view, however,
that need not worry the Government, because
all these people have their own candidates, in
any case. But that has nothing to do with
the point I am making. The Government
are responsibleHon. Mr. MURDOCK: We are representing
Canada.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But the Government have a majority. The Government have
the responsibility of arming the country in
this present crisis, and that is a responsibility
from which there can be no escape. I admit
quite freely that it was wrong to reduce the
Air Force when it was reduced. The only
thing that can be said in mitigation of the

SENATE
course that was taken is-and this argument
never appealed to me, though it did to many
other people in this country-that at the time
there was a general belief that peace had
settled down upon the world. The policy of
many European nations and of the component
parts of the British Empire was then one of
disarmament. You have to be fair in discussing the matter; you have to recognize the
facts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend says that was chaoged, though, in 1936,
I understand.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think 1935 marks
the change. That year marks the rise of
Hitler, the militarization of the Rhine and its
control by Germany, conscription in Germany,
and the obvious intention of Germany to
embark upon the course which she is now
following. These things occurred or became
manifest in 1935, or thereabouts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend is only proving the truth of the old
adage, that hindsight is sometimes better than
foresight.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, I am not.
The Air Force was reduced in, I think, 1932.
As I have already remarked, if there is
anything to be said in mitigation of that, it
is that at the tine an atmosphere of peace
seemed to have descended upon the world,
and it appeared that disarmament was the
proper caper for the various countries. I
never believed it, and I said so at the time,
but the popular view prevailed.
We come
ow to the Air Force as it is
to-day, four years after the present Government came into power. First I might say
that the strength of the Force has been
increased, which is all to the good. Next I
should like to say that the efficiency of our
Air Force, having regard to the lack of training facilities, is excellent.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Will my honourable friend tell the House how tremendously
the possibility of aeroplane manufacture has
increased in this country during that time?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, yes. But if
it had not been for orders from the Btitish
Government there probably would not have
been such an increase. The business is a
growing one, and it has a civil side as well.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Which the Government have encouraged in every way.

That is just start-

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. KING: No; it has been three
years in preparation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: A lot of time had
to be spent in getting ready.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We have thirtysix front-line aeroplanes, a certain number of
training planes, and a certain number of
obsolete planes. In the event of an outbreak
of war to-day, to-morrow or the next day, these
training planes and obsolete planes would not
be used. We would not put our men into these
planes to meet the enemy, for to do so would
be to turn our Force into a suicide club.
For the defence of the country in war-time
we have thirty-six planes, and these are divided
into various classifications which are necessary in an air force. There is a proportion
of bombing planes, of fighting planes, army
reconnaissance planes, and possibly of other
classifications.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Pursuit planes.

Hon. Mr. KING: These facilities have
been very much increased too, have they not?

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
bombers?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Facilities have
been increased, but by no means to the extent
of increase in other countries. However, they
have undoubtedly been increased.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, yes, there are
some, but I am not sure how many.
If we became engaged in war to-morrow
we should have to divide our air forces into
perhaps three groups: one for the Pacific
coast, one for the Atlantic coast, and one for
a central reserve. So there would be just
twelve planes in each group. And each of
these groups would be divided into the various
classifications of planes which I have mentioned. In no part of the country would our
Air Force have any particular strength. From
the point of view of active defence of Canada,
it is fairly negligible.

Hon. Mr. KING: Very much so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A glance at the
Minister's speech will show in what direction
increases have been made: barrack accommodation, flying fields, suitable training planes,
and so forth.
We now have, at the end of four years of
our rearmament policy, thirty-six front-line
planes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

MAY 1, 1939
Passing now to our Navy, we find that during the past four years the Government have
increased our destroyers from four to six;
that four mine-sweepers have been put under
construction, and some into commission. And
the personnel has been increased. It is a
matter of gratification that our Navy personnel is highly efficient. Strangely enough,
it has been highly efficient from the beginning.
Our men make excellent sailors, and when
they go down to warmer areas, as they do
once a yearHon. Mr. DUFF: To the Caribbean Sea.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -to the Gulf of
Mexico and that neighbourhood, and come
into competition with the British Navy, they
singularly distinguish themselves. I draw the
attention of honourable members to the fact
that the destroyer is the smallest type of
warship. It is armed with 4-7 guns only. This
is an excellent gun, but one enemy cruiser
armed with 6-inch guns could drive our destroyers from the seas. We have four destroyers on the Pacifie and two on the Atlantic
coast to protect the focal points of our trade,
police the seaboard. and the like. Our Navy
is wholly inadequate to the task and the importance of the responsibilities involved, our
export trade representing something like
S1 000,000,000 a year.
Nothing has happened to the land forces
at all. Their strength is 31,000. The men
are wearing clothing that was issued in the
late war. The same suits have for years been
worn by different men. These uniforms are
faded and shabby, and the men strongly
object to such clothing. Undoubtedly its unpopularity plays no small part in keeping the
strength of our land forces at a low ebb.
There should be an issue of brand new clothing,
and I am glad to learn that this to some extent
is in hand. Very important, too, is the fact
that for many years no boots have been
issued at all. An issue is proposed.
The strength of our militia is fixed by
law. and now a very serious question arises.
The service is not popular because it has for
years been starved and neglected. In a
word, our militia bas never been treated properly. It so happens that with the development of various kinds of amusement and
pacifist propaganda military service is not
popular with our young men. Many units
are below strength. Some units are up to a
strength of 350 men, but there are scores
of battalions, batteries and squadrons which
are so far below strength as to provide no
opportunity at all to officers and non-commissioned officers for training. Instead of
having in the ranks the finest young men in

273

the country, as used to be the case thirty
or forty years ago, to-day we have half-grown
boys in the service. The officers, who, without any financial. compensation at all, devote
themselves to militia training, spend most of
their time trying to get men to enlist, and
still more in trying to retain them in the
ranks. This unsatisfactory condition militates
against training and discipline. We should
accord all honour and credit to those who do
serve in our militia under these adverse conditions.
The militia forces should be raised from
31,000 to 100,000 men. I have no hesitation
in making this suggestion, for undoubtedly
we shall be confronted with the question of
man-power. and ultimately there will be a
severe strain on the voluntary system. It is
on trial now. If the Government to-morrow
were to authorize a training establishment of
100,000 men we could not begin to fill the
ranks.
I hold the opinion, which I know is endorsed by active soldiers throughout the
Dominion, that the Government must undertake steps to popularize our militia service.
One step in this direction would be to consider the attitude of employers towards their
men with regard to leave for annual training,
and so forth. I suggest that we should adopt
the British policy. In England there is a
public relations officer to grapple with matters
which militate against the popularity of the
service, such as pacifist propaganda, the attitude of employers towards their men taking
up regular training, and the like.
I advocate such a policy because the problem
which will confront us ultimately is the provision not only of man-power, but of trained
man-power to take over the machinery incident to the mechanization of our forces.
Eventually the whole of our army will be on
wheels, and we shall require men of very high
type who will undertake training and stay on
the job. The Government would be well
advised to increase at once the number of
men in training, and at the same time appoint
a public relations officer to popularize the
service and arouse in our young men an
interest in military training.
One step in this direction would be to discard the word " militia." We have used it
for many years. It connotes about the fifth
line of defensive power. It means a ragged,
untrained gathering together of a certain
number of armed men. "Militia" is an unpopular word. In the United States the
volunteer forces are called the National Guard.
In Australia the militia is referred to as the
Citizen Force, but colloquially it is known as
the army. In England the term "Territorial

274

SENATE

Army" has been substituted. I suggest the
Governmnent should direct attention to this
matter and adopt the word "army," as we
have no other ar-my than our militia, service.
The termi is more dignified, the men would
like it better, and it would tend to, popularize
the sel-vice.
1 think we should also follow the example
of Australia and provide for promotion of our
keen volunteer officers to higher ranks than
they are granted to-day. In Australia several
divisional coînmanders aie non-professional
soldiers. They devote much of their time ta
their own training and qualify themsclv es. lo
a national army I do not think it is a good
practice to have the higher positions reserved
for professional soldiers.
In brief, I advocate that the strength of
31,000 men should be increased to 100,000
men, for the purpose of having nt only
more trained man-power, but men capable of
handling the machines with which the force
is to be equipped, and that to add to the
dignity of the service and the pride of the
nien whio serve in it the titie "army" should
be substitiîted for "inilitia." The mere change
of titie may flot have any sig-nificance for
civ ilians. but I can assure lionourable members it w ould have an important bearing in
ppuJarizing the service.
N'ýow, otîr artillery is arîned with 18-pounder
field guns and 4-5 howitzers. These gunis are
obsolete in type. Tlîey were used in the ha st
war and inany of them are worn out.* I
should add that these are horse-drawn guns.
Great Britain bias adopted n gun which performs the functions of a field gun and
howitzer. It is mounted on rubber tires and
hauled by a tractor.
We cao buihd the equipmeot in Canada.
We have no tanks nor armoured fighiting
vehicles, for the like. Our troops would ba
ait the miercy of any small mobile body armed
wîth this modern equipmeot. We have three
anti-aircraft guns.
Such guns are urgently
needed for the defence of our ports on both
coasts and at other vuincrable points in
Canada. This equipment, ton, we can manufacture in this country.
As to aeroplane production, we are gradually becoîning a factor, owing almost enitirely
to the growth of civil aviation.
The departmeot of defence to which attention must be given is our caast defence. Something lias been done in this direction, forts
having been constructed an both the Atlantic
and the Pacifie coasts. I am flot so sure
that the necessary armament hias been supplied. Perhaps one should ot discuss it at
very great length, but I suspect that some oi
uur forts nre without guns.
Hen.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

Coast defence cansists of structures of steel
and cancrete armed with heavy guns of 6-inch
and higher calibres. These guns must be
equipped w-%ith optical instruments of variaus
sorts and for varinus purpases. The range ai
'lhe gun must be cavered with searchlights for
night work. The approaches ta aur harbours
must alsa be mioed.
We canna t manufacture big guns at the
moment, and I doubt whether there is any
oeeessity for aur doing sa, but we cao manufacture searchîlight equipment, optical instruients, mines, torpedaca and the depth charges
that go with coast defence.
I agree that the Gavernmcnt are wise in
proceeding with caast defence lit once, assuming thcy are ýwarking on the basis of limited
appropriations.
Coast defence is needed ta
caver railwvay termini, and ports where slîips
can ýbe equipped, victualled, and the like.
In addition ta the fixed defences of these
selected poaints, there must be a sufficient
eýstaihishiment of mobile traaps of ail arms
ta prateet any threatened points an the caast
whîich are nat sa fartified.
We could not
affard ta fortify every part of aur caast. For
tlus mobile service we require wireless and
telephionic communications. It alsa calîs for
rapid transportation aver railways and gond
roads. We cao make all the necessary mobile
equipmen t.
In dealing with the defence of Canada we
miust neyer forget thiat there is impased on us
the duty of defending Newfaundland.
No
agreement exists ta this effeet, but the island
is righit at the fr-ont door of Canada and we
could neyer affard ta allaw it ta be accupied
by an enemy force. Cosequently aur military
plans must take into accounit the defeoce of
Newfoundland.
Now I camne ta the armament industry, about
which there has been a gond deal of talk,
turning mainly on the question whether the
Gavernment or private industry shoiild manufacture aIl equipment, or whether each should
take a share in its production.
I am ot
wedded ta any rigid policy. My chief cancern
is efficiency, but I think that having regard ta
aur population, resources, and sa an, we ought
ta be alble ta build up an arînament industry

engineering skill, the labour and the materials.
Here is an example of what might be danc
in this direction. I have bcd a man of considerable experience colleet information for

I have spoken of the new field gun adopted by
England, the 25-paunder. I raised the question

manufactured in Canada. The answer is yes.
About four or five years ago General Ashton,
who, was Chief of the General Staff, held the
view that the Govern*ment should build an
arsenal for the construction of this particular
gun. There exist in the files of the department
at this moment complete plans and specifications, which are kept up to date, for the
construction of an armament factory to build
this particular gun in Canada. The memorandumn states:
The approximate cost of such a gun factory
would be $2,000,000. The estimate would include the carrnage works and other necessary
accessories tu turn out the complete weapona
on wheels, ready for use. Approximately eight
months would be required to commence delivering guns. If the plant were employed on the

rough approximation of the price for which
1nscould be sold to a Canadian or other
ovel-rnments would be $25,000 for a 25-pounder
up to $60,00O for a 3-7 QF AA gun.

production of 25-pounders'only, guns could be

There is a subsequent note to, the effect that
as a result of experience gained in England,
and in view of the fact that the new 25-pounder
gun, which is also a howitzer, is of much more
simple construction than its predecessor, this
price can be scaled do.wn suhstantially.
My point is this. First of ail, a report was
made to the Minister in 1935 in which the
whole situation was disclosed, and which also
gave a list of the equipment we ought to
have. Now, if in 1935 or even in 1936 the
Government had decided to embark upon an
armament policy, working through our civil
industry, we could have bujît, at a cost of
$2,000.000, a factory which, delivering guns at
the rate of two a week, would by the end of
December. 1938, give us 208 guns. It is estimated that with the experience gained in that
production the output would have been something like 250. Turning to the report handed
to the Minister, I flnd the number of guns
recommended is 500. Consequently, by this
time we should have been well over the haîf-

way mark in equipping our forces with the
most modern gun, and in doing so we should
have been keeping our money in Canada,
playing an important part in re-equipment,
and at the same time building up an industry.
Here is a point which this report brings

to my attention, and in turn I draw it to the
attention of the Huse. It says that a manl
occupying a very high position in the industrial life of this country helieves we can manufacture all our equipment in Canada. He goes
on to say that if it were possible to approach
the Government openly and get reasonable
consideration for such a proposal, he could
within three hours flnd the necessary capital
to finance the project. Further, he says he

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is something
fundamentally wrong with this country. Any
military student who studies the war efforts
of this country in the past will find that we
have turned out excellent fighting men,
excellent soldiers, but that in the administration there have been incidents that reflect no
credit upon the country, and that have cost
us a great deal of money. And no political
party is free from that accusation. It is a
fact of our political life, and I am attacking
that fact wherever it may exist, whether in
previous Governments, the present Government, or future Governments. It may be that
we shall have another Government after the
election, and I shall be just as insistent then
as I am now regarding this matter. If in the
building of canals or public buildings you want
to graft, you may take your chances; but when
it comes down to the directing of the money
which the people of this country have voted
for rearmament, into improper channels, or
to the supplying of soldiers in the field with
inferior equipment, rotten food and worthless
boots, I will fight it with all my power.
Hon. Mr. KING: I agree with the honourable gentleman there. But wlhen the honourable gentleman reads a letter of a manufacturer

This statement was handed to the Minister
about 1936, I should say, for it appears to,
synchronize with the adoption of this type

of equipment by the British Government.
This is equipment that we should have in
order to put our ]and forces on a reasonabie
basis of operation. The Government have
been grappiing with the question and refiecting
and cogitating on the whole mnatter for at

ieast three years and a haif, and they have

brought ta hand but two classifications: of the

123 anti-aircraft guns which were recommended
they have produced 3, and of the 544 infantry
mortars which they were supposed to have
they now have 5. The whoie of this equipment is on order with the War Office in
Great Britain at a time, when they have not
compieted the armament of their own forces;
and by reason of the adoption of conscription
in the Oid Country, and the doubiing of the
territorial army, it wiii be a matter of years

before we can get any of this equipment at
ail. I mention this merely to support the

278

SENATE

general proposition that we should have an
armament industry in Canada. I go further.
I say that if the Government had embarked
on a real policy of rearmament in 1936, half
of this rearmament program would have
been carried out by now; the guns, the tractors, the armed fighting vehicles and all of
these things, to the extent of half our requirements, would have been in our hands by now.
Now I want to discuss another matter, which
came before us as the House closed last year.
It will be remembered that the right honourable gentleman who leads this side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) interrogated the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) and asked whether any requestI think the word "request" was used-had come
from the British Government to the Canadian Government for permission to establish
in Canada a training school for the Royal Air
Force. An argument followed as to whether
or not there had been any "request," and the
right honourable gentleman changed his inquiry. It finally turned out that there was
some discussion between the two governments
and that the British Government did want
to establish training schools in Canada for the
Royal Air Force. There were several reasons
for this. First of all, hundreds of young Canadians were finding their way to England, at
their own expense, and were joining the Royal
Air Force. The British Government appeared
to take the view that some facilities should
be provided to enable these young men to
join the Royal Air Force in Canada. Any
augmentation of the Royal Air Force is a
large program. The strength went up from
about 11,000 men to 120,000 men. To bring
these young men into complete training, aircraft are required.
But there was another
reason for wanting to establish training
schools in Canada. It was this. If you wish
to establish a bombing field you have to take
four square miles of country and remove the
whole population from it and devote it entirely to this work. It is a serious matter to
take four square miles of agricultural territory out of production in England. The next
point is that England is a very small country.
England and Scotland together are net much
more than six hundred miles in longth. It
is necessary to have long distances over which
bombing planes can be tested, not only as to
the endurance of the machines themselves,
but also as to the endurance of the pilots.
Well, if there is one thing which they have
net got in England and which we have in
Canada, it is distance. We aiso have all kinds
of waste land. Over here it would be possible to carry out training flights of five hundred or six hundred miles from established
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

camps to points in northern Ontario. On such
long flights the endurance of pilots would be
tested. and there would be opportunity for
practising the dropping of bombs.
Thero was another consideration. When a
plane is flying for target practice it will probably carry two bombs, each weighing 1,000
pounds. If a group of twelve or fourteen
planes so equipped is flying over a very dense
population in England and one of the planes
meets with an accident and falls to the ground,
a thousand persons may b0 killed, or a whole
town destroyed. Such a risk would net be
necessary in Canada, where we have large
waste spaces and paucity of population. But
the Government of Canada refused to consider
the British proposal. There is no doubt about
that. The reason given was that the Prime
Minister did not think it seemly, or consistent with the dignity of our country, that
there should be established here an armed
force belonging to another power. In other
words, he put Great Britain in exactly the
same classification as Poland, Turkey, Roumania, Spain, or any other foreign country.
Later on he said that the Government were
considering proposals to make an offer to the
British Government for the training of Royal
Air Force pilots in Canada. We were told the
other day, in the speech to which I have
been referring, that provision has now been
made to train every year fifty pilots and other
ranks of the British air forces, in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of Canada.

Under the laws

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Under the laws of
Canada, under the instructors of Canada, and
under the limited facilities that we have in
Canada. Fifty pilots, when they talk of them
over there by the five thousands! The training
of fifty will be of about as much use to
Britain as the proverbial fifth wheel is to a
wagon.
And w-bat did we lose by refusing the British
proposal?
We lost the establishment of
camps where from five te six or seven thousand
young mon would have been in training. Their
pay would have been spent here, and large
sums of money would have been expended
on their food, on the construction of camps,
preparation of fields and so on. Ail these
moneyvs would have come in from outside.
And we lest an opportunity of taking care of
four or five thousand of our own young men
of about eighteen or nineteen years of age,
at a time when, as our papers are constantly
reminding us, many thousands around that age
are walking the streets in a vain search for
employment.

MAY 1, 1939
I believe that the acceptance of the British
offer would have had much to do with encouraging the establishment of an aircraft industry
in Canada, which would have meant the
putting of many additional millions of dollars
into circulation.
I want to make myself quite clear as to
the position of the Minister.. He has been
given certain appropriations in the last four
years, and I think it is fair to say that ie has
made a wise expenditure of the money that
ie had. I am not criticizing him at all as to
his expenditures. He has done something in
the matter of coast defence, and he has
accumulated a larger supply of military stores.
He referred in his statement to a number of
other things' that had been done, but the two
matters I have just mentioned are the most
important ones. My complaint is that the
appropriations have not been large enough
to enable him, or any other Minister, to carry
out rearmament of our defence forces. We
shall never get anywhere with the kind of
appropriations that have been made, and I
think proof of that is to be found in the almost
negligible progress in rearmament that the
Government have made during the last four
years. Our defence position is not a bit better
to-day than it was four years ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend says that what the Minister has
done on the coasts is commendable.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. I said I
would abstain from discussing the armament
on the west coast, because that raises another
question as to where the guns out there came
from. The Minister did not see fit to discuss
the matter, and I do not intend to go into it.
I have some doubt as to whether our coasts
are as well protected as they should be, and
that is a matter for which we all have some
responsibility. I have admitted that there
has been an increase in the accumulation of
stores. But from the point of view of defensive and offensive qualities, our land forces
are not a bit better than they were four years
ago. We have tank battalions that are not
equipped with tanks; and our machine gun
battalions are equipped with very few machine
guns, besides being up to a ,trength of only
31,000 men, which I think is below what it has
been for years. Our strength has not been
increased, either for offensive or defensive
purposes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What does my
honourable friend mean by offensive purposes?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is a military
expression. I do not care for the distinction
that is made between offensive and defensive

forces, but it is a distinction which politicians
apparently make. To be on the defensive
is considered a worthy thing, but to take the
offensive is considered objectionable. So we
call our forces defence forces and we speak
of our defence estimates, and so on, in order
that nobody's feelings may be hurt. And we
say that the purpose of our armed forces is
the defence of Canada, which of course is just
so much poppycock or hooey for the delusion
of simple-minded people who worry about
such things. It is all very well for politicians
to talk about our defence forces, but really
our defence forces are of no use unless they
are able to take the offensive. It is not
enough to resist an enemy; it is necessary to
beat him; and to do that you must be on the
offensive; you have to out-man him and outgun him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course my
honourable friend is speaking of the contingency of an invasion of Canada by a
foreign power.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is a contingency.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not see it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If the honourable leader were in a position to guarantee
to the Government and people of Canada that
no enemy would ever come to this country,
then we should dispense with the whole of our
armed forces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I mean, invasion by the army of a foreign power.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The United
States do not agree with my honourable
friend. They conceive the possibility of Great
Britain and France being defeated in the next
war and having to hand over their navies to
the conquerors. The United States also conceive the possibility of being in the front line
in the next war, and they consider that the
defenceless condition of Canada would be a
serious menace to themselves in that eventuality. Of course, what I am speaking of may
never happen. But soldiers are like fire chiefs.
The mere fact that there has not been a fire
in the town for a week is no guarantee that
there will never again be another fire there.
The fire department has to keep on its toes all
the time, i.n order to be ready whenever a fire
does break out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a lot
of water, though, to put out the kind of fire
my honourable friend was talking about before.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: But water is of no use if
you have no fire engine, hose, or other fire
fighting equipment.

280

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DUFF: You can use a bucket
brigade.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I want to make it
clear that I think the Minister has done as well
as he could. The responsibility rests upon the
Government. Of course, the Minister must
bear his share of that responsibility, just as
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) must. In the past four years the
Government have done nothing to improve
our defence position. As I have already said,
they have done nothing to make it any better
than it was four years ago, except to secure
three anti-aircraft guns, as against 123 that are
needed, and five infantry mortars, as against
544 that are needed; and they have added two
destroyers to our Navy. But the combined
strength of our Army, our Navy and our Air
Force is not adequate to take care of the
simplest problems of defence. We are unable
to protect our own trade routes on either
coast. One enemy six-inch-gun cruiser could
drive our whole fleet off the seas, or wipe it
out. And, I repeat, frorn the point of view
of fighting planes, our Air Force is negligible.
The position of our land forces is no better.
From information that reaches me I can
assure the Government that our people are
getting nervous and apprehensive. The Government will be surprised some day to find
that there is a distinct feeling of dissatisfaction with their policy.
Hon. Mr.
quarters.

DANDURAND:

In

certain

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In enough quarters to form a majority of the people of this
country. The Government may not think sa,
but they are approaching an electionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I call those
bellicose quarters, as admittedly represented
by my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I venture to say
that in what I have stated this evening I have
represented the views of a great many people
of this country, people who believe that our
position is distinctly unsound. The Government will in the near future find that it is
distinctly unsound if, as everyone now admits,
international relations are going to be conducted on the basis of armed strength. We
must do something effective in this country,
and do it soon. We have lost a great deai
of time already.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my honourable friend's statements are in direct contradiction with the views expressed by the
right honourable leader on his side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) at the opening of this
session:
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Why continue to have the fact cloaked under
this snoky atmosphere of independent defence
by ourselves, somîething we know we are utterly
incapable of, something we never professed before, and which we know we cannot possibly
develop in days to come?
The right honourable gentleman stated that
we must rely on somebody for our defence,
and his suggestion was that we must co-operate seriously with Great Britain, but he said
that to think of establishing our own defence
of Canada was pure nonsense.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
share.

Quite sa.

But we must do our

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What he meant
to say was that in our present position we
are defenceless and that for our defence we
must rely upon Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: In other words,
we are living in a delightful place commonly
known as Tin Pan Alley.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think that is
over the head of the honourable leader. What
the right honourable leader on this side said is
that we are unable to defend ourselves, and
if we are being defended at all it is by Great
Britain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He said that
Canada could not defend itself.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Now.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Now. That is
what I am complaining about. What I am
saying is that we must no longer have a
colonial outlook, but must prepare to defend
ourselves. I say that we have the men, the
industry, the capital, and the engineering skill
to do it, and I predict that what I am saying
at this very moment will meet with substantial approval in many parts of this country.
Before I sit down I should like to bring up
again the question of the control of our
armed forces, which I spoke about a little
while ago when we were discussing the Defence Purchasing Board Bill. By law, by
Orders in Council, by custom and practice we
have developed a system of government of
our armed forces which calls for the exercise
of responsibility and executive and administrative duties on the part of certain officers at
National Defence headquarters. It is essential
for the good government of our military forces
that not only should these officers be compelled to assume their full responsibility and
discharge their duties up to the hilt, but they
should be left alone ta do so. Now we have a
method of parliamentary control, and there
stand between Parliament and these officers
the Minister and his Deputy Minister.
I

MAY 1, 1939
want to draw attention to the danger of
possible civilian interference with these officers in the discharge of their duties-if such
interference has flot already occurred; and
perhaps I could discuss that. I warn that if
we permit it we shall land ourselves in just
the same position as we did when we allowed
the same kind of thing some twenty years ago.
A rather sinister fact has been brought to my
notice in the promotion of the Deputy
Min.ister to the rank of Major-General. If
that means anything at ail it means clothing
him with some military power, standing or
position which enables him to talk on terms
of equality with respect to purely military
matters to the soldiers, sailors and airmen
who are administering their respective
branches. The Government must not permit
that. If they do, they will make endless
trouble for themselves.
So long as 1 have an opportunity to raise
my voice here I shall be on the watch for
that kind of thing and speak against it whenever I see any evidence of it. I shaIl insist
that soldiers, sailors and airmen be left in
charge of their respective branches, that they
discharge their responsibilities and duties to
the hilt, and that in so doing they be not
subjected to civilian interference.
In closing I want to urge the importance of
establishing a munitions industry in Cana.da
for the equipment of our own soldiers. We
have the industry, the resources and the
capital necessary to build such an enterprise
into a great resource for the whole Commonwealth. The *venture would have a business
aspect as well. It would mean the expenditure
of millions of pounds of British money in our
country, and would improve our industrial
conditions generally. If we were to proceed
along this line, not only should we, go a long
way towards fulfllling our obligations to our
own people and to the other members of the
British Commonwealth, but we should also,
as I said in opening, be able to play our part
within the grand alliance to which we belong,
that group of nations who are banded together
to maintain the liberties of mankind in this
present crisis.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure we are greatly indebted
to, the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) for the very illuminating and informative address he has given us
on the defence of Canada.
I rise at this time merely to express my
regret that the Government have not seen
fit to implement the late Admiral Lord
Jellicoe's minimum naval program, which I
referred to in this House some two or three
vears ago. Lord Jellicoe recommended that

we have three light cruisers armed with 4-inch
and 6-incb guns, anti-aircraf t, torpedoes, four
submarines, and six destroyers. We have the
destroyers, but we have neither the submarines
nor the cruisers. This is a very serious matter.
As bas been pointed out by my honourable
friend-and I made a similar statement two
sessions ago--a light cruiser armed with 6-inch
guns could in twenty minutes blow to pieces
any of our destroyers that came within range.
Therefore I press the Government to, impIement the late Admiral Lord Jellicoe's minimum
naval defence program, and also to reopen the
Naval College. It is a great pity that the
Aurora was allowed to rust to, pieces some years
ago. To-day she would have been a very
valuable ship.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: As a training ship?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Not only as a
training sbip, but also as a defence ship.
However, I will not dwell on that matter at
any length.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
spoke of the recommendation of three or four
years ago. Is he quite certain of the date?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think it is at
least two sessions ago that I referred to the
matter.
Hon. Mr. KING: bis speech was made two
years ago, but I am asking ýwhen the recommendation was made by Lord Jellicoe.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In 1919.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is different.
Hlon. -,Mr. BALLANTYNE: When the honourable leader of the >Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) riscs to reply, either this evening
or possibly to-morrow, I wish he would throw
some ]ight on certain passages of the speech
delivered in the other bouse last Friday by
the honourable Minister of Defence, referring
to naval affairs. As reported on page 3492
of Cornmons Hansard, the Minister said:
It is to be assumed that hostile fleets wil
be restrained and constrained by the presence
of the B3ritish and American fleets on the
Atlantic and the Pacifie, but under modern
conditions complete blockade is impossible. and
attack upon Canada's overseas trade at its
congested points will be by way of minor raiding
forces.
Then he proceeds to say-and this is a good
deal more important than what I have just
quoted:
Beyond our focal sea areas Canadian overseas
trade receives -a measure of protection by the
British Navy on the north Atlantic route and
by the United States Navy on the coastal route
to the Panama canal.

282

SENATE

As this country is part of the Empire, if we
should become embroiled in war, how would
it ýbe possible to counit on the United States
Navy to, safeguard our trade routes on either
the Atlantic or the Pacifie ocean, unless that
country happened to be an aI]y? It seems
to me this was a rather strange statement for
the Minister to make. I can understand the
British fleet doing everything possible to
proteet our trade routes and our coast defences,
but ho.w can we possibly counit on our friends
the Americans coming to, our aid, as he
plainly states, unless tbey are our allies?
When the hionouraible leader of the Government speaks, I hope he wviIl tell us what
commitmnents we bave made with England.
1 presume tbev are what I bave quoted-that
tbe Government have arrived at some arrangement with the Imperial authorities as te what
they would be prepared *to do, should war
break out, in the way of protecting eur sea
routes and our coasts, and as to wbether we
could depcnd on the north Atlantic fleet
doing se. If we have any military alliance
with our neiglibours to the south. as the
remarks of the Minister of Defence would
indicate, proýbably the leader of the Government would ýbe good enough to tell us about
it.
I think the.rih honourable leader on this
side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) wishes te
speak on the subjeet, and if nobody else
dezires tu continue the debate to-night, I
move that it be adjourned te the next sitting
of the flouse.
The motion was agreed te.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUJL DANDURAND moved the
second reading cf Bill 90, an Act te amend
the Criminal Code.
Hie said: Honourable members who have
looked at this measure will have found it is
somewhat in flie nature of wliat is termed an
omnibus Bill. It contains a number of amendments te the Criminal Code. It is a Bill of
the kind which we have come te regard as a
hardy annutal. Some of the amencdments are
important, but I suggest that we give the
Bill second reading now, and that to-morrow
in Coinmittee of the Whole we discuss the
amendmnents in detail.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Does the honourable
leader of the House propose te have this
B3ill referred to Committee to-night or have
it stand over until the next sitting of the
llouise?
Hon.

Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was told that
an- henourable senator had indicated bis interest in the Bill. I could net reach him when
I came into this Chamber. Se we migbt take
second reading now and go into Committee
cf the Whole to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

All right.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I suggest this Bil
bc sent te a special committee. The Criminal
Code bas been amended se frequently that it
has become very voluminous. I have always
taken an interest in amendiments te the Code.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Most cf the
amendments are sug-gested by the AttorneysGeneral of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
thing about that.

I do net care any-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But they carry
some weight by reason cf such recommendatien. 0f course, we are net bound by the
opinion that may be behind the suggested
amendments. but 1 am quite sure that if My
honourable friend between now and to-morrow
will peruise the Bill he will find very littie
reasen for taking exception te it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: We shahl have te
provide more gaoîs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of these amendments.

Oh, net because

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

I think se.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

He said: The purpose of tbis motion is ta

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 90, an
Act to, amend tbe Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Duff in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed ta.

On section 3-resisting execution of search
warrant:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is simply
to add the word "air."
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is al
right.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-search:
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: What is this?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The objcct of
this amendment is to correct a clerical error.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- It should have
been "cleven" instead of "ten."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-evidence; anus of proof:
The object of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this amendment. wbich is made at the request
of the Deputy Attorney-General of British
Columbia, is to eliminate the necessity of the
Crown proving tbat the accused bas no visible
means of support, and to prevent persons Sa
charged from av.oiding provisions of the subsection by baving wbat the City Prosecutor
of Vancouver cails "an 'alibi job,' sucb as a
sixth interest in a cigar stand or bootblack
chair." The words "and bas no visible means
of support" are stricken out; so the clause
wilI read,:
Where a maie persan is praved ta live with
or ta be habitually in the company of a
prostitute or prostitutes, or ta live in a house
of prostitution, he shall, unless he can satisfy
the court to, the contrary, be deemed ta be
living on the earnings of prostitution.
That section is
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
very indefinite. In the first place it says
"habitually in the com.pany of a prostitute or
prostitutes." You will have ta prove first
that they are prostitutes, and I fancy there
will be some difficulty in doing that. It scems
ta me the section is very badly drawn. It
saYs, "wbere a male persan is proved ta live
With or ta he babitually in the company of
a prostitute or prostitutes." That should be
within bis own knowledge.
0f course the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
anus of proof is upon the prosecution.
Not necessarily;
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
and I do not tbink the anus shauld be upon
the accused. If he is accused of a certain
offence, surely the Crawn sbould prove -the
offence. To my mind the section is entirely
useless.
Section 5 was agreed ta.

284

SENATE

On section 6-prohibiting dýriving; copy of
order for registrar:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is simply
a question of procedure. The object of this
ameodment is f0 require a copy of an order,
which fiay ho issued, to be forwarded to the
registrar of motor vehicles in any province
wherein a licence or permit to drive has been
]ssued to the person convicted, so that the
provincial authorities may have a record of
such order. The proposed amendment, which
is indicated by underlining- and vertical line
in the text, reads as follows:
lu the event of sich an oiIcr bcbig mnade the
court or justice shall forw ard a copy thereof
to the registrar of lootor veiceles for the prov'inca wherejni a permit or licence to drive a
nmotor vehicle or automobile xwas isstîed to such
persan. Suehi copy shail be certified under the
seal of such) court or justice or, if there be
no sucb seal, undler the hand of a judge or
pre.silî:og magistrate of suelh court or of sucb
justice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is ail
righit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If is of no
great consequence, but it will be useful.
Section 6 wvas agreed to.
On section 7-publication of false advertisements f0 promote sales, etc.:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: This section
is aIl rigbt, but. certainly the English would
be improved if the words "either directly or
indirectly." in lina twelva, were placad after
the word "promofing," instaad of being before
it as they now are. The wording would then
read. "for promoting aither diracfly or indirectly."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I bow to my
right honourabla friend's superior knowledge
of English.
Righf Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The objection f0 the split infinitive is not just technical.
This is flot a split infinitive, but is somewhat
hîke it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move that the
change suggested by the righf honourable
gentleman be muade; that is, that the word
"promoting" be taken out of the thirteenth
line and placad in the twelfth line between the
words "for" and "either."
The CHAIRMAN: If the ameodmaent is
agreed to, the wording will ha:
Every parson who publishes, or causas to ba
publisbed, any advertisement for promoting
eitber directly or indirectly the sale or disposal...
and 50 on.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

The amendment was agreed to, and section
7 as amended was agreed to.
Section 8 was agreed f0.
On section 9-receiving clothing or furniturc fromn soldiars, airmen or deserters:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The object of
this amendmant is f0 make the section
applicable to airmen as wall as soldiers. The
only change is the addition of the word
"airman."
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It seems f0 me that
the penalty of five years is excessive. The
justice of the peace, or presiding- judge, would
have no discretion whatevar, but must impose
a sentence of five years, if there were a
conviction. That seems to me severe.
Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND:
change in the penalty.

There

is ne

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The only change is
the insertion of the word "airman," so, as to,
make the section applicable to airmen.
Section 9 was agreed

f0.

Section 10 was agreed f0.
On section 11-rfusing fo employ, etc.,
members of a trade union; intimidation f0
prevent workmen from balonging to a trade
union:
Hon. Mr. MecIJIRE: Honourable members, I f hink this clause might well be considered further. The objact of the amendment here is apparent ly to ansore the freedorn
of workmen, but, as the section stands, if
applies only f0 'workmen who are trade
unionists. I suggest that a couple of words
be inserted, s0 that if would apply f0 aIl
workmen. The section makes an employer
hiable if hie refuses f0 employ or dismisses
a workman simply because he is a trade
unionist, but thera is no reference f0 workman
who are not members of trade unions. I
would suggest that affer the word "is" in line
33, the words "or is not' should be inserted.
This would make the section read:
Any employer or bis agent, whether a parson,
company or corporation, wbo wrongfully and
without law fuI authority
(a) refuses to amploy or (ismisses f rom hMs
employmient any person for the sole reason that
such person is or is not a membar of a lawful
tracte union...
and so on.
Hon. Mr. GRJESBACH:
the offence dhen?

What would be

Hon. Mr. McGIJIRE: That would prevent
a man froin hc'ing penalized bcasie hie did
flot belong f0 a trade union. If should nof

MAY 2,1939
be necessary for a workman to join a trade
union in order to be eligible for employment,
or free from the risk of dismissal if he is
employed.
I suggest that in order to provide the alternative in paragraph (b) the words "belong to
or" be inserted between the word "to" and
"abstain," in line 43. That paragraph would
then read:
(b) seeks by intimidation, threat or loss of
position or employment, or by actual loss of
position or employment, or by threatening or
imposing any pecuniary penalty, to compel workmen or employees to belong to or abstain from
belonging to such a trade union or such an
association or combination to which they have
a lawful right to belong.
As I say, this amendment in the Criminal
Code is intended to protect the freedom of
workmen. I submit that it should apply to
all workmenHon. Mr. POPE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: -and not alone to
workmen who belong to trade unions.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I am unable to grasp my honourable
friend's argument. As the explanatory note
says:
The object of this amendment is to make it
an offence to unlawfully refuse to employ a
person, or to dismiss a person, for the sole
reason that such person is a member of a lawful
trade union or association, or to seek, by
intimidation or threat, to compel an employee
to abstain from belonging to such a trade union
or association, or to conspire with any other
employer to do any of these things. The section
is new.
It bears on a special situation. It protects
the right of a workman to belong to a lawful
trade union, or a lawful association or combination of workmen or employees formed
for the purpose of advancing their interests
in a lawful manner. In these circumstances
I should not be disposed to alter the form
of the section, which bas been prepared with
considerable care by the Department of
Justice in order that we may effect the desired
purpose and remain within our constitutional
jurisdiction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
object to the amendment proposed by the
honourable senator from East York (Hon.
Mr. McGuire), though I do not think many
employers will dismiss a man solely because
he is not a member of a trade union. There
are some odd features to this new section.
A man ought not to be dismissed just because
he is a member of a trade union. Indeed, no
man should be dismissed for any lawful act.
So long as it is lawful for a man to be a
member of a trade union, he should not be

28à

punished for that. It seems to me that when
legislation is being passed to prevent intimidation or threats which would have the effect
of keeping a man out of a union, it would be
logical to legislate the converse also, against
intimidation or threats to get a man into a
union.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw my right
honourable friend's attention to the fact that
members of two unions may be working under
the same roof.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Then there
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
would be a question of what pressure could
be exerted against an employee because he
did not belong to the union of which a
majority of workers in the plant were members.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman bas missed my point, which
is that if you make it impossible or dangerous
to seek by intimidation or threat to prevent
a man from joining a union, you ought also
to make it an offence to seek by intimidation
or threat to compel a man to join a union.
Workmen ought to be left free to exercise
their own choice.
Then I find it difficult to understand why
an employer should be punished because he
does not hire a man.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It bas to be solely
because the man is a member of a trade
union, though.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If I am a
member of a union and apply to an employer
for work, he cannot refuse to take me on
if bis sole objection is that I am a member of
a union. If he does so refuse, he commits
an indictable offence. Why should it be an
offence not to do something?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: How will it be possible
to obtain a conviction under this, in any
event?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know.
I think I am aware of what is in the mind
of my learned friend from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris). I do not think there need
be any fear and trembling throughout the
land as long as the words "wrongfully and
without lawful authority" are retained.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: At the request of
my leader I move:
That in line 41 of paragraph (b) of section
11 the word "causing" be inserted after the
word " by."
The amendment was agreed to.

clause

as

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What has the
honourable gentleman who leads the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) te say on the
question of whether we have jurisdiction to
pass this legislation? There is some fairly
substantial opinion that we have no such right.
Last year, when a similar bill was before the
other House, the Minister of Labour said, as
reported in the Commons Hansard at page
2971:
There is in this measure, however, a very
definite attempt to secure protection of the right
to organize by an amendment to the Criminal
Code, and it is the opinion of the law officers
of the Department of Justice that such legislation would be colourable and that the proper
means of giving due effect to freedom of association lie within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. In those circumstances, therefore, obviously the Government cannot accept
le islation which, in the opinion of the law
oficers of the Crown, would be inoperative and
invalid.
The Minister of Justice had spoken along
mucli the same lines earlier in the same year.
As reported at page 840 of the Commons
Hansard, he said:
But my honourable friend wants to go further
than that. He wants to make a crime of something which in pith and substance relates to
contract and comes under property and civil
rights, and under our constitution is within the
jurisdiction of the provinces.
Those are two weighty opinions. I sbould
like to know how the honourable gentleman
reconciles the introduction of this Bill by the
Government in face of the opinions of those
two Ministers who thenselves last year quoted
the law officers of the Crown as authority for
a contrary view.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
same legislation.
Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH:

The principle was

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
know that the wording was exactly the same,
but undoubtedly if the argument applied to
the other wording it applies also te this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister
of Justice was asked in the other House:
Could the Minister indicate what legal constitutional interpretation there is of the term
"lawful trade union" or "lawful association"?
He replied:
This, as in the case of other words in this
section, is for the purpose of ensuring that the
section will be held valid and within the jurisdiction of this Parliament. As my honourable
friend knows, in a general way relations between
employers and employees and labour matters in
general are under provincial jurisdiction, and
if in any province there was anything that proHon. Mr. MURDOCK.

vided that a certain union was not lawful in
that province, of course this clause would not
apply.
The Minister of Justice proceeded to state
that in every province but one legislation
had been passed lately, and, was merely
strengthened by the intervention of the Parliament of Canada through the Criminal Code.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Did the Minister of Justice say, in effect, something had
been donc to the former bill to bring it
within the jurisdiction of Parliament? If se,
what was donc?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read his
statement. After this clause had been conmended by all those in the other Chamber
who rose to express an opinion, the Minister
of Justice said:
Obviously this section meets with the approval
of all honourable members in the Committee. I
may say the drafting of the clause was difficult.
The difficulty arose in framing it in such a way
as to permit its being upheld by the courts.
We had it in mind also to frame it in such a
manner that it would not result in unfairness
or injustice to anybody. That is why certain
words, which the honourable member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Woodsworth) bas mentioned, such as "wrongfully and without lawful
authority," have been inserted in the section.
I agree with the honourable member for
Kootenay East (Mr. Stevens) that it is not
desirable to use the Criminal Code for all sorts
of purposes, especially in connection with
matters which are rather within provincial
jurisdiction. When the bill proposed last year
by the honourable member for Winnipeg North
Centre was being discussed, J referred to the
clecision of the Privy Council in connection with
the Insurance Art of 1917, and I quoted the
words of Chief Justice Duff, who sat on that
case. J quote them again:
Lordships think it is .Their
no longer open
to dispute that the Parliament of Canada cannet, by purporting to create penal sanctions
under section 91, head 27, appropriate te itself
exclusively a field of jurisdiction in which,
apart from such a procedure, it could exert no
legal authority, and that if, when examined as
a whole, legislation in form criminal is found,
in aspects and for purposes exclusively within
the provincial sphere, to deal with matters coinmitted to the provinces, it cannot be upheld
as valid."
That is what made the matter difficult.
There is no doubt that matters concerning
labour are provincial in scope. The provinces
have te do with hours of labour, wages and
relations between empioyers and employees. I
was afraid that the bill presented last year
could be challenged successfully by any employer against whom proceedings miglt be
taken. As the Committee knows, employers
would have the means to go through all the
courts. It is desirable that legislation should
be proof against the possibility of adverse
judgment by the courts. The trade union
officers realize that, and they have applied to
all the provinces to do what my honourable
friend recommended should be done by this
Parliament. As my honourable friend said
last year, and as the trade unions stated in
their brief presented to the Rowell commission,

MAY 2, 1939
the trade unions want the Federal Parliament
to supplement the provincial legislation and take
a stand as to the validity of labour unions and
the right of labour to belong to a union.
Last year I gave a list of the provinces which
had adopted legislation making it unlawful for
an employer to dismiss an employee because
he was a member of a union. Practically all
the provinces have now adopted legislation which
entitles us to pass this implementing legislation.
In spite of what the honourable member for
Broadview (Mr. Church) said, the province of
Ontario has no legislation of this kind. However, I am happy to see in the press that a bill
has been presented. If it is accepted by the
Ontario Government there will then be no
province in which the act of an employer in
dismissing an employee for membership in a
labour union will not be considered unlawful.
In Quebec the Fair Wage Act, chapter 50 of
the Statutes of 1937, and another Act, chapter
49, respecting workmen's wages, deal with this
question. It is specially stated that whoever
revents by threats or
From becoming a memberotherwise an employee
of an association, and
so forth, or who makes an attempt upon the
freedom of an employee by dismissing him
because he is a member of an association, commits an unlawful act.
I am sure, and it is the opinion of the officers
in the Department of Justice, the legislation
of the various provinces being what it is
to-day, that Parliament bas the right to pass
this legislation and adopt the principle of the
Bill of the honourable member for Winnipeg
North Centre merely by adding the few words
which have been inserted in the section. As to
the fear expressed by the honourable member
for York South, I do not think he needs to
worry. The section bas been carefully drafted,
and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr.
Manion) mentioned, the word "sole" is put
there for the purpose of protecting the employer
who may have other reasons for dismissing an
employee. An employer is committing a crime
oniy when lie dismisses an employee for the sole
reason that he belongs to a labour union. I
think that is protection against the situation
suggested by the honourable member for York
South.
In conclusion I need only say that the Bill
of the honourable member for Winnipeg North
Centre was discussed last year. Even this year
there was almost unanimous approval, the constitutional difficulty being the only obstacle to
its acceptance. I .think that has been overcome,
and L believe this legislation will make it clear
that employees in this country have the right
to belong to trade unions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thoroughly
appreciate the argument of the Minister of
Justice. I do not think this legislation will
ever go to the Privy Council. It is merely
intended as a bid for the lalbour vote. That
fact could not be made plainer if it were
written across the top.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it not come
before Parliament for a number of years?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes; but
what is now being handed Labour is just an
empty dish. The Minister's reasoning makes
clear that the, dish is empty. He said the
Bill was ultra vires before the insertion of the

words on which lie laid such stress. And it
was. It sought, by making certain actions
of the employer criminal, to invade the jurisdiction of the provinces in respect of contracts
between employer and employee. In that
way we have the same circuitous humbug
which we had when Parliament made insurance companies guilty of crime if they carried
on business without a Dominion licence.
Consequently the Minister of Justice said:
"This is just the same kind of legislation.
It really relates- to contracts and therefore is
provincial, but if we make it a crime we
He added that that
secure jurisdiction."
reasoning was exposed in the insurance case;
and lie was right. But now he argues: "Inasmuch as we have inserted the words 'wrongfully and without lawful authority' we bring
the legislation within federal jurisdiction."
He made it plain to me why this is so, but I
doubt whether it would be plain to others who
have not followed his interpretation of the
law. If under the law of a province it is
wrongful and illegal for an employer to
dismiss an employee because lie is a member
of the union, then such dismissal is wrongful
Therefore, wherever the dismissal is wrongful,
it is wrongful by virtue of a provincial law,
and the penalty is already prescribed therein.
This Parliament comes along and says:
"What the provincial law has said to be
wrong we will say is wrong, and we too will
prescribe a penalty." Now, what is the sense
of that? It is just 'sham.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Nonsense.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The province
must first say the dismissal is wrong; otherwise this legislation will not apply. That is
the argument of the Minister; and the
Minister is right. If it is wrong within the
province now, Labour has everything it needs.
So we are just coming upon the scene
aribitrarily, without any real purpose, and are
declaring something to be wrong because the
provinces declare it to be wrong. Now, if
Ontario does not pass an Act-I do not know
whether it has done so or not, but I think
I have seen a statement that it had notthis measure does not create an offence within
Ontario at all, for the doing in that province
of what is referred to here is not without
la'wful authority, and therefore this measure
does not apply. So what this section does is
to make certain action an offence in a place
where you need not make it an offence at all,
and to omit to make it an offence where it is
necessary to make it one. It is just an effort
to catch the vote.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Mr. Chairman,
it seems to me that we are going a little
too fast in creating a crime when a penalty
has already been provided in the Small
Loans Act, which was passed a few days ago.
Clause 3 (1) of that Act said:
Any money-lender who enters into a transaction in contravention of the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of an indictable offence
and liable, if an individual, to imprisonment
for a terrm not exceeding one year and to a
penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and,
if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding five
thousand dollars.
Now, without even knowing whether this
law is going to work or not, without even
knowing whether there will be a breach of

this law, we make the transaction referred
to a crime, and say in sub-clause 504 of section 12 of this amending Bill:

section. shall be guilty of an indictable offence
and

to imprisonmient

for a terni not exceeding one year and to a
penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and.
if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding five
thousand dollars.
It seems to me we are going rather fast.
We should at least give the law passed a few
days ago an opportunity to prove whether it
is workable or not.
I do net want to seem to be protecting the
money-lender, but lot us look at what is
called "cost," and see how this provision would
work, for example, in Saskatchewan. We have
poor people there. Suppose a man wants to
borrow $100 for one month. According to the
section before us, the cost shall not exceed $2
a month. Take a chattel mortgage as security: it costs $3 to write it, 75 cents to swear
the affidavits, 50 cents to register it, and 25
cents to make the search; or a total of $4.50.
The lender can charge only $2. At that price,
if money-lenders operate at all, they will
form a charitable institution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We make philanthropists of the money-lenders. I think
they will succeed in adapting themselves.

Section 12 was agreed te.
.On section 13--refusing to make alterations,
etc.:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Fire
Marshal of Ontario wrote me with regard to
iis Bill, and I am pretty sure this must be
the section to which he referred.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It covers the situation.
Section 13 was agreed to.
Sections 14 to 26, inclusive, were agreed to.
On the preamble:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Chairman, if I
may do so, I should like to refer to section 7
of the Bill, which deals with the penalty for
the publication of false information in advertiserments.
I am net opposed to the
principle at all, but it strikes me that the
provision goes pretty far. If, in order te sell
goods, a person publishes or causes to be
published "any statement purporting to be

MAY 2, 1939
one of fact which is untrue, deceptive or misleading," he is liable upon summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding $200, or to
six months' imprisonment. We all know that
there are hundreds of advertisements throughout this country respecting which there is at
least very grave question as to whether or not
they are misleading or deceptive.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is pretty hard
to cover.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Every day and every
night the air is filled with all sorts of exaggerated statements which are made over the
radio to bring about sales. One question that
occurs to me is whether we should not insert
in this section some qualifying provision that
would to some extent safegu'ard innocent persons. You will notice that there is a provision
protecting newspaper publishers. Suppose I
am a merchant, and I buy goods from a
manufacturer in Toronto for the purpose of
selling them. In the course of his business
that manufacturer in Toronto makes certain
representations to me as to the quality and
use of the goods, and that sort of thing. On
the basis of that information I make up an
advertisement. As soon as that advertisement
appears, anyone who wishes to do so can
attack me on the ground of its inaccuracy,
and unless I can prove it to be accurate I
immediately become liable, on summary conviction before a magistrate, to a penalty of
$200 and six months in prison. That seems to
me to be dangerous.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out to my honourable friend that this section
is not new. The fact that it is old does not
necessarily mean that it is perfect, but it has
been on the Statute Book for some time. I
cannot trace it back to the time when it first
appeared in our criminal law. I would draw my
honourable friend's attention to the amendment now before us, which is in these words:
"or promoting any business or commercial
interests." I think this amendment is worthy
of adoption, because, especially in the promotion of new business, false representations
are made which induce innocent persons to
join in such ventures. It seems to me that
we are under obligation to offer some protection to people approached by oily tongued
individuals who make representations for the
promotion of a business or commercial venture.
The object of this amendment is to make the
provisions of the subsection apply not only
to a false advertisement respecting the sale
of real or personal property, but also to a
false advertisement promoting any business or
commercial interest. The proposed amendment
is indicated by the underlined words in the

289

text. It seems to me that, if there is any
virtue in the clause itself, it is improved by
the addition of these words. Of course we
are on somewhat delicate ground, because
there are many ways of reaching the public
and making representations.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The matter may be
very difficult.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The proviso
seems rather odd. It says:
Provided that any person publishing any such
advertisement accepted in good faith in the
ordinary course of his business shall not be
subject to the provisions of this subsection.
Accepted by whom? By himself?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The publisher.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That refers
only to the newspapers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Oh, they
always get off.
While on my feet, may I ask the leader
of the Government whether he bas received
requests from any business interests that they
be heard regarding this Bill? I received some
such requests, and told the writers that the
proper person to refer to would be the Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My secretary
informed me yesterday that a gentleman,
whose name is well known in the labour world,
wanted to see me before this Bill passed.
I told my secretary to notify him that the
Bill would be considered in Committee to-day.
I have had no further information.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
what I mean. I had a request for a hearing
from certain employers of labour who were
opposing the Bill. I did not say they would
be heard, but I intimated that if they wrote
the leader of the Government he would, I
was quite confident, have the Bill referred
to a committee.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have received
no information in regard to that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suppose
they came to the conclusion that the legislation was just a mockery anyway. They
referred to only the one clause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend treats our legislation lightly.
The preamble was agreed to.
The title was agreed to.

STATE OF CANADA'S
DISCUSSION

DEFENCE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the question proposed
by Hon. Mr. Griesbach, calling the attention
of the Senate to the state of the defence of
Canada.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, the naval defence of Canada is at
all times a very serious problem, and it has
been especially so during the last few years.
At the present time it is an acute problem.
In the circumstances I should be glad to
obtain some information through the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The Government discarded the
Jellicoe plan of three light cruisers and four
submarines, which had been arrived at only
after Canada's naval needs had been expertly
examined.
What
examination, by what
experts, preceded the adoption of the present
destroyer policy? Who advised the Government to digress from the Jellicoe plan?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Jellicoe plan made public?

When was that

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sure the
House is aware that during the Imperial
Conference of 1918 the Prime Ministers of the
overseas Dominions, accompanied by their
lon. MIr. DANDURAND.

Ministers of Defence, met in London, where
the question of naval defence was discussed.
It was unanimously agreed that the very
distinguished Admiral Lord Jellicoe should
tour the Dominions, consult with the various
governments and give expert technical advice,
as he was so well qualified to do. I happened
to be at the time Minister of Naval Defence
for Canada.
Admiral Lord Jellicoe spent
some six weeks in this country, during which
time he had discussions not only with me,
but with the Government, and his final report
recommended as a minimum prograrn the plan
which I have referred to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that?

What year was

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 19'19. It may
be asked why this program was not implemented years ago. For a period following
the War, as honourable senators know, all
countries were considering disarmament. As
a matter of fact, a Disarmament Conference
was held at Washington in the year 1921.
So there was very good reason why Lord
Jellicoe's recommendation was not carried out
by the governments which were in office from
1919 up to, say, three or four years ago. But
in view of the extreme anxiety which we have
undergone in the last two years, and the
most serions condition now existing in Europe,
I cannot understand why the present Government have not implemented that very reasonable program. I brought it to the attention
of this Chamber some two sessions ago. I do
not want to repeat what I said then, but I
sbould just like to remind honourable members
of a reference I made to the state of affairs
which developed on our Atlantic coast in
1918. German submarines, which were at that
time off the coast, fired upon a number of
our fishing boats and sank one ship of some
7,000 tons. We could get no help at all from
England, and had our neighbour to the south
not happened to be one of our war allies at the
time and not sent a cruiser to patrol our
seaboard, matters would have become a great
deal more serious.
During these last few years we have been
without submarines and light cruisers, confining our naval defence to destroyers, two
of which are new and four second-hand, three
of them ten years old. The Royal Navy set
aside a number of destroyers as being obsolescent, but not obsolete, and we bought four of
that type. I have felt for many years, and
more so lately than at any other time, that
the Minister of Defence and the Government have not really been alive to the seriousness of our lack of naval defence. As I said
on a previous occasion, I do not pose as an

MAY 2, 1939
authority. However, it seems to me clear
that if we are going to be attacked at all it
will be from either the sea or the air. To-day
the German fleet is no longer bottled up in
the Kiel canal. About forty of its vessels
are in Mediterranean waters, and if unfortunately war were to break out, our Atlantic
seaports might be attacked by some of those
ships. A number of them are most likely
equipped for raids, and would be engaged
in hit-and-run undertakings. Besides, German submarines would in all probability come
over here again.
Yet we have no submarines or light cruisers
for our own defence. All we have are a few
mine-sweepers and destroyers. I know the
destroyers would be very effective in dropping depth charges, provided the positions of
submarines were known; and considerable
damage could be done if it were possible to
shoot torpedoes within the range of an
enemy ship. But the guns on our destroyers,
as I said last night, are not larger than 4.7,
and these would not be of much use against
the six-inch guns on enemy light cruisers.
What I am particularly anxious to know is
why the Department of National Defence,
and particularly the Naval Branch, have not
given the consideration that should have
been given to the plan recommended by such
a distinguished and experienced man as
Admiral Lord Jellicoe, who during the War
was Commander in Chief of the greatest of
all naval fleets.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
Honourable senators, while speaking on the
necessity of defending our country, I do not
wish to discuss the participation of Canada
in extra-territorial wars. In 1917 conscription
was a great mistake. Those who understand
the mentality of French Canadians know it
will be impossible in the future to enforce
overseas military service.
"Canadians should not be forced to go and
fight on foreign soil." I am proud to see that
the leader of the Conservative party is
against conscription. Let there be no further
question of compulsory participation by
Canada in Imperial wars. I wish to make
sure of Canada's real defences and of the
protection of Canadian territory. Public
opinion is favourable to a rational policy,
made, up, of reasonable measures for the
defence of Canada.
- The Conservative leader's statement in the
House of Commons against conscription
satisfied my compatriots and calmed their
fears.
71498-191

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why not add
at the same time the name of the Prime
Minister, as they both spoke along the same
line?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: He will. His speech is
not over yet.
Hon. Mr. PAQUET: I shall do so at the
end of my speech.
My first duty is ta work for the maintenance
of national unity. As has been said, "National
unity is assured so long as the main purpose is
to safeguard the rights of the Canadian
people."
The Minister of National Defence asks
Parliament ta vote $63,000,000. We must
bring our material up to date, so it will be
on the same footing as that of other countries.
We must protect our trade routes. Canada
has become vulnerable. Aeroplanes and submarines are new factors of importance. I
know my compartiots wish to defend Canada,
our religion, our liberties and our institutions. They are ready for such sacrifices, and
will not shirk them.
I must state that I am opposed to compulsory participation of Canada in foreign
wars.
In discussing this grave question of
Canada's defence and our participation in the
wars of the Empire, we must consider the
interests of Canada. The honourable member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
called our attention to the defence of Canada.
I wish to speak in a truly Canadian spirit in
making a few remarks on a question which
ruined my political career, threatened Canadian unity, and might to-morrow endanger
the lives of our brothers and our children.
On the 31st of March last I was bitterly disappointed. Thanks ta the Statute of Westminster, I thought Canada's foreign policy
might be that of an entirely independent
nation. I do not wish ta make light of the
noble efforts put forth in the course of this
century towards the winning of our national
independence. The right honourable Minister of Justice stated on March 31, 1939, that
our independence is not absolute, and that
the Statute of Westminster had not conferred upon us complete autonomy. The
words spoken by the right honourable Minister of Justice troubled me and disquieted
the whole country.
Further, the Prime Minister of Canada repeated a famous argument heard during the
debates on the Navy: "When England is at
war, we are at war, and subject ta attack."
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Is it not true?

te me tbat tise very feundation uDson which
we must buiid home defence is the confidence
cf or people in the demnocratie systemn cf
geverniment. Tbey must have a feeling that
it is the best possible form of gevernment,
and scmething worth fighting for. It is very
difficuit at the present time for many of our

MAY 2, 1939
people to have that feeling of confidence
while they are suffering deep privation in the
midst of plenty. So to Canadian women today patriotism means many things. It means
the conservation of food and the proper distribution of surplus supplies in order that
all our citizens may have healthy bodies,
without which it is impossible to have healthy
minds or a proper outlook on the pressing
problems of the day.
I must admit that many times when we
try to talk about this to men, we are called
impractical. Well, we have in this country
to-day contrasts which I can only designate
as stupid-contrasts of under-nourished children in a land of plenty, of people in the
Prairie Provinces starving for fresh fruit while
apples go to waste in British Columbia. We,
with our impractical minds, can sec no reason
why there should be an outbreak of scurvy
among the women and children of Northern
Ontario from lack of fresh fruit and vegetables
while in old Ontario thousands of bushels of
apples and tomatoes lie rotting on the ground
because there is no market for them. Yet
when we ask for a solution the answer usually
comes: of course women are not practical in
these things. If, honourable members, this
anomalous condition be the result of applying practical business methods in a mangoverned country, then, frankly, I do not
think even impractical women can do very
much worse! I have a feeling that perhaps
they might do better, because women abhor
waste. The great majority of us are accustomed to economizing and planning in our
homes, and I really believe that Canadian
women might offer some helpful suggestions
towards the solution of these problems-if by
any chance they were consulted.
To-day we Canadian women desire to give
concrete form to our feeling. During the last
few weeks we have given it expression by
launching a scheme for the national registration of women. As I have been asked by
several members of this Chamber for some
details of this scheme-for they, in turn, have
been asked for information by women in their
respective constituencies-I may be allowed
to read a letter which will be sent out by the
provisional committee, of which I have the
honour to be a member, to presidents of all
women's organizations of national scope. With
this letter upon Hansard, honourable members
will be in a position to supply information to
any who may request it. I shall read only
the pertinent parts of the letter:
For the past six months a group of women
have been working on a plan in which all the
women's organizations in Canada would under-

take as a co-operative and voluntary effort the
registration of the women of Canada with a
view to determining what service they could
render to the country in the event of a national
crisis.
Various groups of women in different parts of
Canada have already, from among their own
membérship, collected certain records and undertaken different forms of voluntary service and
training. In order to make these records and
services readily available in the event of a
crisis and to extend the plan to include al]
Canadian women, some more comprehensive survey must be undertaken.
We have assured ourselves that the project
is acceptable to the Government of Canada and
that the information which we propose to get
will not only be welcomed by those responsible
for the defence of the country, but will be of
great importance in the event of a crisis.
In organizing for emergency service, the
women of Canada have the advantage of the
experience and example of a similar undertaking
in England.
It is hardly necessary to say that if
democracies are to hold their own against the
highly organized dictatorships, spontaneous and
voluntary effort must in substantial measure
take the place of the force and suasion exercised
by dictators. The members of this provisional
committee, though not more concerned than
other women in Canada, have felt that they
could be doing their country a service if they
were to do what they are doing in this letter,
namely, inviting the leaders of all national
organizations of women to meet to consider some
organized plan of service which would coordinate the efforts already being made in this
direction.
The concrete plan we have in mind is to
secure, through the various organizations of
women throughout the country, a complete registration or tabulation of all women who are in
a position to give any kind of service that
may be valuable for defence or other emergency
purposes.
A questionnaire will be sent out by way of
ascertaining the capabilities of every woman
and her position, including her readiness to fit
herself for possible emergency duties.
It is intended that the registration shall be
purely voluntary, and that the completion of
the questionnaires does not involve any commitment on the part of those who complete them.
Although the occasion for making this survey
of the women is the present strained international situation, it is hoped that it will not
have to be used for the purpose of defence, and
that by making the questionnaires wide enough
in their scope, the information obtained from
them may be useful in enabling women to help
solve other urgent national problems, for
example, unemployment, conservation of food
and its proper distribution.
This letter is being sent to the presidents or
other heads of women's organizations of every
kind which have Dominion-wide organizations.
Later, provincial and local organizations will
be formed to carry out the actual work. of
registration and tabulation.
May I emphasize the fact that though this
plan will entail a great deal of work, it will
be on an entirely voluntary basis. We hope,
as is stated in the letter, that the registration will not be needed for defence purposes,
but we do feel that if it is not so needed

294

SENATE

it may be made of inestimable value to the

people of this country in helping solve sone
of our other problems.
I am firmly convinced that the great
majority of Canadian men and women to-day
are only waiting for .leadership-leadership
that will enable them to demonstrate to the
world at large that Canadians love their
country sufficiently to devote all their energies
to some scheme for the national good, and
that without any thought of monetary gain.
But I believe it is equally true that when
that call to service comes, if there is to be
that whole-hearted and enthusiastie response
whieli will be necessary, our people must also
be assured that in so far as it is humanly possible, if trouble .comes tiere will be equality
of sacrifice.

DEFENCE PURCHASES, PROFITS
CONTROL AND FINANCING BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consider the
amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 38,
an Act to establish a Defence Purchasing
Board to control the awarding of contracts
for the manufacture of defence equipment and
the construction of defence projects, to limit
costs and control profits in respect of such
contracts, and to authorize the raising by
way 'of loans of certain sums of money for
such purposes.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, when the motion for second reading of this Bill was before the House I proposed three amendments. First, I suggested
that the Chairman of the Defence Purchasing Board should be made a member of the
Defence Council. That suggestion has been
adopted'by the committee. Secondly, I suggested that all contracts now existing between
the Government of Canada and any other
person with respect to the supply of equipment be brought under the supervision of the
board. The committee bas made this amendment too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: At the same
time I questioned the value of the clause
which limits profits on non-competitive contracts to 5 per cent. As will be observed
from the report, the committee has done
nothing with that clause.
When the Bill was before the Senate I
pointed out that a limitation of 5 per cent
on non-competitive contracts was dangerous,
in tbat it would hamper the Government in
acquiring equipment which is urgently needed
at the present time. For instance, need
might arise for a type of equipment covered
by patents, and this equipment could be
supplied only by the person or corporation
in Canada in control of those patents. On
the Government endeavouring to purchase
such equipment the patent owner would
state his price, which might carry a profit
of 20 per cent. Thereupon, as a result of the
limitation imposed, the Government would
be compelled to refuse to purchase at that
price and, in the alternative, would have to
take equipment of a type which might be
very inferior. I may say that often the
difference between an up-to-date and an
obsolete weapon is merely the difference of a
contrivance covered by patents.

SENATE
In the committee, while we were in agreement that the 5 per cent limitation was
dangerous in view of the necessity for speedy
rearmament, our difficulty was to say what
would be a fair profit. To arrive at a sound
conclusion on this point we needed to obtain
a great deal of technical expert advice from
a large number of persons, and in the time
at our disposal this was not possible. The
committee thereupon took this somewhat
unusual step. It passed a resolution to the
effect that in its judgment the clause was
dangerous in that a limitation of 5 per cent
was too low and was likely to prevent the
Government from carrying out their duty to
effect speedy rearmament. We asked the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to
lay that resolution before the Government,
as well as some evidence presented to the
committee by those who might be thought
to know somnething about the matter, namely,
the president of the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association and a number of persons engaged in aircraft construction. The« honourable leader returned to the committee and
announced that the Government intended to
stand firm upon the clause. Of course, the
responsibility rests with the Government.
I know that in the minds of some persons
it is almost a criminal offence to reflect upon
the good faith, the honesty and the integrity
of the
present
Administration. So,
as
delicately as I may, and with every intention
of being as inoffensive as possible,Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -I go so far as
to say that I cannot but feel that the Covernment are seeking to gain political advantage, with regard to the next election, by
being able to point out that in this legislation they have limited profits to 5 per cent.
As a matter of fact, I am informed that every
technical officer of the Department of National Defence knows that this limitation of
5 per cent is dangerous. I repeat, the Government have seen fit to put themselves in an
advantageous political position, having regard
to the next election, and they are doing so
at the expense of the rapid and efficient
equipment of our military forces. Against
that I most strongly protest.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have already spoken at
very limited length on the subject of this
measure. Since I did so the Bill bas been
before our Committee on Banking and Commerce, whore a series of amendments have
been made, with practically all of which I
am firmly in accord. One or two others I
Hon. Mr. GIUESBACH.

had intended to suggest in committee, but,
not having before me the copy on which I
had made my notes, I failed to place those
suggestions before its members. The amendments are more or less of a detailed nature.
I mention two details now, before proceeding
to what I regard as infinitely more important
in the discussion of this measure than any
amendments of that character.
I do not quite understand two provisions
with respect to the Civil Service. It occurs
to me that of itself the second, that is subclause 3, is enough without tho first, that is,
subelause 2. No one wants a civil servant
to lose by being seconded, but I fear that
under the Bill as it now stands some will
gain by being seconded, fron the standpoint
of collateral services, such as pension.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What clause?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On page 8.
I should like the Government to consider the
addition of the following words after the
word "gratuities" in the third line of subsection 2 of section 10: "to which he would
be entitled had he not been so seconded."
It occurs to me that possibly, without those
words, new rights would accrue to seconded
persons or certain of them. I do not speak
with absolute certainty that this limitation
is necessary, for I am not thoroughly familiar
with all superannuation provisions, but I
think someone who is should look into it
carefully.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would my
right honourable friend suggest that subsection 2 be withdrawn-that subsection 3, covers
the point?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My suggestion is that the leader of the Government
submit what I have said te, say, Dr. Clark.
I would accept his opinion, because he knows
the other Acts more fully than I do. I fear
there is danger of additional advantages, not
intended by Parliament, being given by that
subsection 2.
Now, I will deal with the main feature of
this measure as it appeals to me and as, I
think, it will appeal with increasing force to
the people of this country as days, weeks and
months move on, and as the time arrives when
our mood of seriousness is even deeper and
more foreboding than it is to-day-in a word,
when this Act is in definite and formidable
operation. The subject I now discuss will
then be a feature of infinite consequence to
the people of Canada. I do not think any of
us can claim that we are more anxious than
others to avoid undue profits of any kind
made in industry because of war conditions.

MAY 3, 1939
I put myself on record as in favour of every
limitation that can be put on, consistent with
the functioning of industry for war purposes.
There should be no limit too strict, so long
as we are certain our machinery will work;
so long as we can get goods produced and
results achieved.
We submitted this Bill to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce after the very few
words I and others expressed on the motion
for second reading. Evidence adduced before
that committee not only entirely justified, but
absolutely proved every word that the senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) and
myself had uttered in this House. There was
not a sentence of evidence to the contrary.
It proved that this 5 per cent clause was
utterly unworkable, utterly absurd and grotesque. Not only was there not a tittle of
evidence to the contrary, but there was not
even an attempt by a single member of the
committee to argue with the witnesses so as
to bring about a different impression. In so
far as our hearings were concerned, all
accepted the evidence. Personally, I could see
no answer to it. Apparently no other member
of the committee could either, and if anyone
had an answer, he never gave it to his
colleagues.
The committee took the view, howeverI was absent at the time-that the proper way
to handle the matter was to express its judgment and submit that judgment to the Administration. This is a Government measure
on a subject of policy the most vital this
country bas ever faced. Further, this, in
essence, is a taxation measure in the feature
to which I am now addressing my remarks.
The Bill provides that taxation shall be levied
on all producers under contract with the
Purchasing Board, other than producers who
get their contracts by tender. It is a taxation
measure taking 100 per cent of all profits over
5 per cent on average capital employed in
production. Evidence showed clearly that in
a most favourable case-namely, where a
contractor would have no other income te be
taxed, and the percentage of his taxation
would not be raised because of such other
income-he would, after he had paid in levies
everything above 5 per cent, and his income
taxes on the 5 per cent, have only 4 per cent
left, and that out of such 4 per cent be would
not be able to charge interest on the borrowed
money. In addition, all risks of accident and
loss must be taken by the contractor. The
unanimous evidence was that no executive in
this whole Dominion could possibly recommend to his board of directors acceptance of
such a contract. The committee heard not one
breath of testimony to the contrary.

297

As to this phase of the Bill, I call attention
again to the fact that it is a taxation measure.
I have always taken the ground in this flouse
-and I know of none who has taken a contrary stand-that, whatever our strict rights
may be, we will not interfere with the taxation feature of any bill. Therefore I shall
not move to strike out this clause, no matter
how strongly I feel about it. It is, I insist, a
taxation clause. It is a clause definitely for
the House of Commons. But I should be a
poor exponent of the public interest if I did
not call attention to its effect and emphasize
what I believe to be the truth, that this clause
is just playing and trifling with the most
vital crisis which has confronted us for twenty
years and in which may be at stake the life
of this British Dominion.
Honourable members say, "Oh, this restriction only applies where we have to contract
'by negotiation and cannot ask for tenders."
That is true; but let us reflect for a moment
whether the field to which it must apply is
large or small. I express the view that it is
large, immensely large; I express the view
that it is vastly larger than it was during the
last conflict, twenty years ago. War bas
become mechanized since the days of the
great struggle. War now is a vast conflict of
deadly mechanisms of the most specialized
type.
You cannot construet a special type of
aeroplane under a contract reached by tender.
There are many reasons why it cannot be
done. The reasons are that patents cover not
only the product, but also the process; leases
intervene; the real ownership may be in
another land; there is only one who can make
the product here. Designs, plans, drawings,
are covered. Everything is the property of
one, and only one, company. And what applies
to aeroplanes applies to a vast multitude of
the complex devices of mechanistic war. It
applies particularly to the Diesel engine, which
will have to be part of every tank. It applies
right down the line. The contracts which
must be let by this board when the hour
strikes-and which should have been let long
months or years before-become the most
terribly serious business that bas ever faced
our land; and the proportion which will be
governed by this clause is going to be very
great. I want to know how the Government
will feel when it finds its board, on entering
that field, tied and paralysed by a clause
under which nobody can contract at all. Does
the Government think this board can contract?
If it does, then this Government has been
most derelict in its duty during the last three
or four years. Has it fixed a limit of 5 per
cent in the past when making contracts?

71498-20
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
Was it able to do so? It bias made contracts,
many of them. We have had one of tbem
investigated lately. I ar n ot going to refer
to it; it lias been discussecl enough. I ar n ot
going to refer critically to a single contract.
Members of the Government made contracts
for aeropianes; with the Boeing Company for
eighteen, I think; witli Fairchilds, of Montreal,
for eighteen, and with tlie National Steel Car
Company for twenty-eight. Did they make
those centracts under sucb conditions that thie
profit would bclie iited to 5 per cent of
capital empioyed? If tliey could bave, should
tliey not have done so? And remember, it is
not 5 per cent of the cost of production, wbicli
is one tliing, but 5 per cent on the average
amount of mnney empioyed.
I tell tliem
tliey did not make thec contracts already

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
scuators, w-e bad tbis Bill before us in coinmittee, and tbc foots as related by my riglit
honourabie friend as to tbe procedure foiioxved
fliere are uncontroverted.
Witnesscs xvere
beerd, and the committee feit tbat 5 per cent
was too lxv. Tbis information xvas comnmunicated to the Covernmnt.
The Government bias Lad tliis Bill closely
examincd by the Department of Finance,
xvbici lied a representatix-e in the committee.
and tbat departmeut feels tbat tbere are txve
clauses, number 4 and number 7, wbicli play
an important role in the Bill. Clause 4 fixes
the procedure with respect te contracts for

MAY 3, 1939
which tenders are invited. To this clause no
objection was taken. The necessary safeguards
are provided in it. Clause 7 fixes the rate of
profit at 5 per cent. It was felt by members of the committee that this clause would
be inoperative. The Department of Finance
says that most of the contracts will come under
clause 4, dealing with cases in which tenders
will be invited; and that as to cases in which
the Government or the Purchasing Board
would encounter ,some difficulty because of
patents covering the equipment needed, there
would probably be but one competitor and
the board would have to devise a means of
protecting the treasury.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of getting
around the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of protecting
the treasury. Now, I do not know what
situation would face the Purchasing Board in
the case of a price fixed by a person or firm
holding the sole right to sell under a patent.
That situation would relate mostly to aeroplane equipment. As my right honourable
friend knows, the board would then have a
problem to solve. The Minister of Finance
thinks there is no insuperable difficulty in
dealing with such a case, and, probably with
that situation in view, he says it must be
remembered that the members of the House
of Commons, representing all sections of the
country, are not disposed to allow the profit
to go beyond 5 per cent.
My honourable and gallant friend from
Edmonton has said that the members of the
Commons had their eye on the electors.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should suppose
that from the 1st of January to the 31st of
December the 245 representatives of the people
in the other House would have their eyes on
the electors, inasmuch as they represent those
electors and must secure their sanction before
they return to continue their mandate.

My right honourable friend knows full well
that all parties, as represented by the present
House of Commons, have agreed to the 5 per
cent. I think it was agreed to unanimously
in the Commons; that is, not only by the
Government and their supporters, but by His
Majesty's loyal Opposition and the other members. This indicates that all the members
there realized full well the situation as
explained by my right honourable friend, and
that not one of them was disposed even to
suggest an increase in the percentage. So, if we
did send the Bill back with an amendment
which would permit a net profit of, say, 10
per cent-that percentage was mentioned in
71498-20b

299

our committee-would the Commons not be
unanimous in rejecting that amendment, just
as they were in supporting the original clause?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But our skirts
would then be clean.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, my
right honourable friend has not moved that
the Bill be sent back with any such amendment.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The bonourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) knows
very well that if the Bill had limited net
profit to 2 .per cent instead of 5 per cent, the
other House would have agreed to that just as
readily, for the same reason that was outlined
by my right honourable leader (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Speeches have
been made outside the House of Commons by
very responsible parties, whom I need not
name, to the effect that not only is 5 per cent
net profit on armament contracts too high,
but there should, he no profit at all on
such contracts, even on those made in times
of peace. I think honourable members -know
what the state of public opinion is upon
this matter.

_ However, since my right honourable friend
has suggested certain amendments for consideration by the Government and the Department of Finance, I will move adjournment

of the debate in order that I may submit
these amendments to my colleagues and the
department.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does my honourable friend intend to submit to the Government only the one question with respect to the
5 per cent limitation of profits?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will submit
to the Government all the amendments suggested by my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen).

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I rise to say
simply that my suggested amendments, while
worth being submitted, are of negligible consequence when compared with the big feature
which I discussed.

I would ask the honour-

able leader to submit that feature to the two
or three very good business men who are
members of the Government. Let us not make
a mockery of this thing.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE
REPORT
SENATE

EMPLOYEES

Hon. G. V. WHITE prcsented, and moved
concurrence in, the third report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
in view of the fact that we have had so much
agitation to reduce rather than increase the
number of civil servants, I should like to
know, for my own information, the why and
wherefore of this particular report.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there is to
be a discussion on the report, it would be
perhaps as weil to postpone consideration until
the next sitting of the House, so that in the
mneantime honourable members might have an
opportunity of reading the report in the
Minutes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I want it understood
that I am not opposing the report now. 1
simply want information.
Hon. Mr. WIHITE: Honourable senators, I
should like it very much if the House could
consider the report at the present time, because
a similar report bas been adopted in the other
House, and it is the desire of the committee
that both Chambers should act jointly and
concurrently in forwarding their recommendations to the Civil Service Commission.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

With reference to the point raised by my
honourable friend from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black), I may say that, as mentioned in
paragraph 5 of this report, the new permanent positions created by the recommendation in paragraph 1 will necessitate neither
the employment of additional staff nor any
additional expenditure. The purpose is simply
te enable certain employees of the Senate with
more than five years' service to be placed on a
permanent basis and brought, under the Superannuation Act.
The motion was agreed to.
DEFENCE PURCHASES, PROFITS CONTROL, AND FINANCING BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the amendments made by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 38, an Act to establish a Defence
Purchasing Board to control the awarding
of contracts for the manufacture of defence
equipment and the construction of defence
projects, to limit costs and control profits in
respect of such contracts, and to authorize
the raising by way of loans of certain sums
of money for such purposes.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, yesterday when this report from
the Banking and Commerce Committee came
before us my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) drew attention to certain
amendments which lie thought it might be
advisable to make, although he was not quite
sure that the points they were intended to
meet were not already covered by the Bill
itself. I submitted that expression of doubt
to the Law Clerk, as well as to the Deputy
Minister of Finance, Dr. Clark. Both agree
that the matters in doubt are completely covered by the text of the Bill. I assume ny
right honourable friend will be satisfied with
that statement.
Now, as to the point raised and emphasized
by the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) and miy right honourable friend, concerning the paucity of profits
under contracts awarded without competitive
tenders being invited. I may say that the
Department of Finance and the Department
of National Defence are coninced that the
Purchasing Board will be able to deal with
any special case in such a way as to protect
the treasury and at the same time secure
participation of contractors in armament work.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Will the
honourable gentleman permit me? Does he
not think the House is entitled to know how?

MAY 4, 1939
Is this House to be satisfied because the
Department of Finance says it will be able to
meet any exigency which arises? Are we not
entitled to know what means the department
will adopt in meeting exigencies of the kind
disclosed in our committee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend is perhaps a little late in asking
for that information. The point was taken
up before the committee, and he could, have
questioned the Deputy Minister of Finance,
who was present. I will not now dilate upon
the point. The committee reported the Bill
to this House; I suppose, with the idea that
responsibility would rest with the Government. The Government accept the few
amendments made by the committee and are
disposed to give the measure as it stands now
a favourable reception in the other House.
It is believed that the Bill, with sections 4
and 7 as they are, can be operated to the
satisfaction of the Department of Finance.
I have no expert evidence to offer to my
right honourable friend. I hope we shall
enjoy peace for some time. If peace continues, experience will be gained from the
operation of the measure, provided it is
passed, and the Government will be able to
study the results before Parliament convenes
again. But should ill fate will that Canada
shall be drawn into a war and have to defend
itself, then, as my right honourable friend
knows, all his fears about the Bill would
disappear, because under the War Measures
Act, which could be applied, the Dominion
could take charge of any institution needed
for national defence. He knows very well
that the safeguards now upon the Statute
Book would avail to protect the country's
interests thoroughly.
With these remarks, I move concurrence in
the report.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does the honourable leader take the view that the War
Measures Act might be brought into effect
before a declaration of war, or only after a
declaration of war?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
Act before me. My first impression is that
it would be after a declaration of war, but
I am not sure.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If the honourable gentleman's impression is correct, the
Government would not be able to avail themselves of the War Measures Act in the
preparatory period at all. If the capacity to
acquire equipment with which to make war
is contingent upon the War Measures Act,
which would only come into effect when war
was declared, the position is not very sound.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not able,
at the moment to say just when the War
Measures Act would apply.
The departments interested say that under
this measure they can produce the necessary
results and at the same tirne completely safeguard the Canadian treasury. I do not know
what conditions may arise, but I rely upon
the statements of the Department of Finance and the Department of National Defence
to the effect that this measure would work
to the satisfaction of the treasury and would
protect the interests of the people at large.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators, I do not intend to speak at any length
upon this matter, for it has already been
thoroughly discussed. It has been clearly
shown that there is no desire whatever on
this side of the House, at any rate, to hamper or embarrass the Government in this.
matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sides are at one in that.

I think both

Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is a recognition of the very urgent and vital necessity
of expediting armament production, and the
object here is to assist the Government. It
is feared by a large portion of the people
that this Bill would delay, rather than expedite, the procuring of armaments by the board
which is about to be set up. No one at all
has any desire to see a contractor receive one
dollar more than a legitimate reward; but,
because of the urgency that exists, the first
and vital consideration, as has been emphasized on this side of the House, is to get
armaments. In view of the contracts that
have been made and other things that have
occurred during the last few years, and in
view of the evidence submitted to the Banking and Commerce Committee, which was al
to the one effect, that industrialists would not
contract if this Bill became law, and of the
fact that neither before the committee nor
in this House has anything been produced to,
break down that evidence, honourable meabers on this side fear that, as our right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
has said, the Bill would prove futile, because
industrialists would not enter into contracts
subject to such limitation of profits as is
here provided.
It is currently known that a large number
of contracts have been entered into by the
Department of National Defence since 1935,
and that not one of them limits the profits
te five per cent.
Right Hon.
twenty.

Mr. MEIGHEN:

Nor toa

302

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have heard
that, but I have not seen those contracts.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Numerous contracts
have been made which allow the contractors
a much larger reward than five per cent.
Upon what basis of fact do the Government
expect to get people to make armaments if
the profit is restricted to five per cent on the
capital employed in the work? We have a
riglit to know that. When the Banking and
Commerce Committee was considering the
Bill I raised this point, but it was not
answered. J also asked the Deputy Minister,
who was present for the purpose of explaining the Bill, if he could tell us the average
profit provided for contractors under contracts that had been made. The answer was
no. The only infornation we hald froin contractors was that they would net be able to
enter into contiacts under the termus of this
Bill.
I put an inquiry on the Order Paper, hoping
to be able to get information about armanent
contracts already entered into, but I am inforimed that the answer is not at all likely to
be made before Parliament is prorogued.
However, I have before mie one of the
contracts, and I intend to give a snrummary of
its provisions. I talke it tat
the ternis in
regard te profits or rewards are pretty unch
the same in all armament contracts. This is
a contract made on Noveemnber 17, 1937, with
thc Montreal Construction Supply and Esiuipment, Limited. It is for the machining of
sheis, 20,000 quiek-firing, 18-pounder high explosive and 10,000 quick-firing, 4.5 howitzer,
high explosive shells.
The reward to the contractor is contained
in paragraphs (ru) and (n) of subsection 1 of
section 4. Paragraph (ru) reads:
Subject to the provisions of clause (o) of
this section, the wages and salaries to be paid,
with the prior written approval of the party
of the first part (the Covernment) for labour
employed directly on:
(1) The machining of the said billets and
forgings.
(2) The construction of special tools, jigs,
and dies.
(3) The supervision of the work mentioned
in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this clause.
Then paragraph (n):
Ten per centum of the amount of wages and
salaries paid for labour as mentioned in clause
(mu) of this section.
Paragraph (o) contains the limitation upon
that ten per centum. It reads:
It is expressly agreed that the total amount
payable under this section in respect of wages
and salaries as mentioned in clause (mu) thereof,
and bu respect of the allowance of ten per
centum as mentioned in clause (n) thereof,
Right ion. Mr. MEIGHEN.

shall not exceed an amount computed at the
rate of $4 for each 18-pounder shell, and $6.75
for each 4-5-inch howitzer siell.
Honourable senators will recall that when
the contract conditions were given out te the
press it was emphasized that the price of
these shîells was fixed at $4 for the 18-pounder
and $6.75 for the howitzer shell. I think the
publie accepted that statement and believed it
te be correct. In this connection J would draw
attention to the fact that under the terms of
this contract the ten per centium is te be based
upon the machining of billets and forgings,
construction of special tools and supervision
of the work. I do net entertain the slightest
doubt that the contractor will see to it that
the wages and salarie and the ton pr cent
aggregate precisely $4 and $6.75 respectively.
The Governmnt,
however, have also to
supply to the con t ractor the machinery set
out in rxhibit B attaced to the contract. Lit

neces.ary to carry out the contract, and te
pay the cost of installing the nachinery and
equipiiient in the contractor's building, the
cost of converting the plant te make it suitable for carrying out the contract, and the
cost of dismantling the machinery and reinstalling the property of the contracter when
his service is ended.
And that is not nearly all.
lon. Mr. MeMEANS:

It

is enough!

Hon. Mr. TANNER: As I read the contract, it will run for about two years, and
the Covernment have te pay for the following: electrie light and current, fixed at $1,270
per annum; heating, fixed at $1,067 per annum;
taxes, fixed at $900 per annum; water supply,
at $100 per annum; maintenance of railway
sidings, at $300 per annum; power, $1,500

MAY 4, 1939
per annum; telephone service, $360 per annum;
clearing snow from sidings, etc., $1,200 per
annum; insurance, $1,200 per annum; rentals,
depreciation, heating and plumbing and repairs,
$3,976 per annum; administration charges,
$336.80 per annum; workmen's compensation
assessments, etc., not fixed; and all materials
used in production of shells. In addition,
the Government have to supply, free of cost
to the contractor, f.o.b. at railway sidings
nearest to the plant, all billets cut to length,
forgings, base plates, driving band rings, special
paint, varnish, packages and boxes required
for the shells.
I think it will be manifest to honourable
members that when the public were told these
shells were to cost the country only $4 for the
18-pounder and $6.75 for the howitzer, they
should also have been told that apparently
the Government were to outfit completely a
shell of a building and pay the cost of the
various items which I have enumerated.
I am not saying that this is an injudicious
contract. I assume that the Government were
compelled to enter into a contract of this
kind, and that from their standpoint it is
justifiable because otherwise they could not
get the shells.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Why not?

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I think the other day
some thirty or forty contracts were laid on
the table of the House of Commons. This is
one of them. It seems to me fair to assume
that all the other contracts entered into by
the Department of National Defence are on a
parity with this one, and that any limitation
of 5 per cent never entered into the mind of
the Government at all. This is all the more
reason why the Governm'ent should be candid
and give Parliament the facts upon which
they expect to get contractors to furnish
armament at a maximum profit of 5 per cent,
as is proposed by this Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill, as amended.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I have no longer any hope
of convincing honourable members opposite.
I cannot convince the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and
therefore I fear I shall not be able to convince
those who sit with him. But there is still
something to do along the line of letting the
country know what a pantomime the Government are going through.

303

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my right
honourable friend allow me to answer a
question by the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)? It bears
on this matter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He asked me
whether the War Measures Act could be
applied before or only when war was actually
declared. I may inform him that the Governor
in Council can, by proclamation reciting that
war is apprehended, bring the Act into force
immediately.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If matters
were not so serious, one could get a good deal
of amusement out of the antics the Government are performing. They are antics of the
most transparent and fantastic type. We were
told this was a Bill to limit war profits; that
when our soldiers were fighting, manufacturers
and others should not be able to make money
out of the nation. This House referred the
Bill to a committee in order to get, from
people who are well informed on the matter,
some comprehension of the effects of the
measure in operation. Citizens of Canada
engaged in business analogous to manufacturing contemplated by this Bill, some of them
in the very business so contemplated, came
before the committee. One and all pointed
out that the limitation of profit was not to
five per cent, but to less than five; that
permissible net profit would not even be
uniformly four per cent. They contended that
in many cases, as, for example, in aeroplane
production, where the contract would run over
two or three years, the very maximum of
profit would be two per cent per annum, and
the contractor would have to assume all risk
of not making anything at all.
A lot of people seem to think that business
consists in simply going into some enterprise
and then taking in profits. I venture to say
that statisties will prove two out of every
three who go into business, whether industrial,
manufacturing or any other kind, make losses
rather than profits. The proportion of those
who lose is, I think, higher than that. Where
three or four men lose, one man, extraordinarily efficient, will make something. The risk,
which varies in accordance with efficiency between two to one and five to one against
making a profit, is all taken by the contractor;
and bis permissible profit, after income tax,
is limited to two per cent if the contract
lasts two years, and to four per cent if it
lasts only one year.

304

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I interrupt
my right honourable friend for a moment?
Is he quite right in saying the limitation is two
per cent? According to section 7 the profits
are limited to five per cent per annum.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN:
That is te
say, if a contract requires two years to
finish, the contractor will be allowed that rate
for the two years?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Yes.

That may
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
be the case. I had argued differently with a
witness and he did not contest my point. I
will not take time to argue it out at this
moment, because it is relatively immaterial.
No human being who has a right to be at
large will enter into any contract where all
the risks are his and where he can make only
bank interest on his money if everything goes
one hundred per cent right. The Government
know that.
After all evidence had been placed before
the committee the Deputy Minister of Finance stood there and never said a word in
answer to it. Did he bave to be asked whether
he had an answer? If he ad an answer and
did not give it because he was not asked, he
is not fit to be Deputy Minister of Finance.
It was his business to tell us that the evidence was all wrong, if it was. He should have
said, "Here is the way we are going to have
the tihing done." He did not do that, and
nobody did. A good many witnesses were
present before the committee, and three or
four said they did not need to testify, because
what had been stated by others was so plainly
right that there was no necessity of saying
anything more.
The committee reported the Bill. Does
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
tell the House how the Act is going to be
made to work, how the Government are going
to meet the practical conditions about which
evidence was given through the committee?
No. He says, "I have seen the Deputy Minister of Finance, who tells me we shall work
it somehow in peace-time." The "somehow"
we are not privileged to inspect. It is apparently no right of ours to know anything about
this mystery. After we are told "somehow,"
we are expected to open our mouths wide
and take that "somehow" in, and digest it,
if we can. Nothing else is expected of us,
according to the testimony of the honourable
leader. And Dr. Clark, the Deputy Minister
of Finance, says, "We shall find some way of
applying the Act." Parenthetically, let me
say: look out for the man who is going to
find some way which is net specified. What
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

he is really hoping is to avoid doing anything, or to beat the devil around the bush
"somehow." As to how to beat him around
the bush, I have not the kind of ingenuity
requisite for a suggestion. If it was not a
devil he expected to meet, he would tell us
the saint it was.
And here is the best feature of all. The
honourable leader says we are net at war
now; so this measure will apply; but if war
is to come, the War Measures Act of 1914 is
on the Statute Book and will govern. Are
all honourable members listening to me?
Were we not told this Bill was to govern
war profits? But now we are told it is a
measure, net for war-time at all, but for
peace-time, and that if war is to break out
war profits will be regulated by the War
Measures Act of 1914.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Possibly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wonder
what other adverb might be put in there?
Imagine a Government coming to a House
of Parliament and saying: "We are putting
through a Bill governing war profits, but it is
intended only for peace-time. When war
comes, we shall use the War Measures Act."
But the farce of this whole thing is even
more preposterous than I have yet indicated.
As long ago as two years or more this Government let contracts for the building of
planes to three contracting firms. In net
one single instance could any of those contracts have been let to any other firm, even
if the Government had so desired. No other
firm had the legal right te build planes of the
type contracted for in each case; nor was
there any other firm which had the necessary
mechanical equipment, or which was in a
position to get that equipment within any
reasonable time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Contracts for
how many planes?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For sixty-four
planes, I think. Will the House listen while
I state how many planes have so far been
delivered? Net a single one
And those
firms were not limited to a maximum profit
of five per cent on capital, as I showed the
other day. They made contracts which permitted a profit of ten per cent on all their
costs, and I showed that those terms would
give a contractor the possibility of making
as high as 25 per cent on capital.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Those contracts would not be affected by this measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly net.
But if the limitation of profits to five per cent
is practicable, why were those contracts not
made on that basis?

MAY 4, 1939

s

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because the
first orders which are fulfilled generally cost
more than those that follow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have no
real defences in this country, not even enough
to stop the raider of a chicken roost. We
have to start now right at the beginning,
except that we have contracts two years old
on which no delivery bas yet been made. I
am not complaining because no delivery has
been made, for I am not at all persuaded that
any delivery was possible. It takes a long
time to prepare for war. The Government
say to Parliament, "We can get contracts
fulfilled on the basis of four per cent
maximum profits"--for that is what it would
mean-"on average capital invested," although
so far it has been found impossible to get
any delivery under contracts which permitted
profits of as high as 25 per cent. The Government of the United States, having experimented with a guaranteed profit of ten per
cent upon cost-which might well be equivalent to about 25 per cent on the capital employed, with all the risks taken by the contractor, as provided in this Bill-and having
found that percentage was not high enough,
raised it to twelve per cent within the last
few weeks. And the Government of that
country have at their disposal arms-manufacturing organizations which outclass and
outdistance ours in every wvay. Does the
honourable leader of the Government realize
what an utterly revolting pantomime we are
going through? We are asked to pass a
measure which the Government hope will catch
votes-a measure whieh has no relation whatever to preparation for defence.
During the last war the first costs of munitions were certainly higher than later costs.
Why? Because while we held profits down
by means of a graduated tax, we made it
worth while to improve efficiency. The higher
the profits the higher were the taxes which
we placed upon them, but we still made
it worth while for contractors to aim at
efficient production at the lowest possible
cost. The consequence was that under very
able management the cost of munitions
went down by about 75 per cent. Would
costs go down under this Bill, except where
Even
contracts were let under tender?
if any contractor could be induced to enter
into a contract, what incentive would there be
to reduce costs? Not the slightest. Nor
would there be any incentive to employ a
minimum of capital and to lower costs in
that way. The incentive would be in the
opposite direction, to put every possible article
of capital already on the ground into production, so as to be entitled to interest on it,

and thereby, through subterfuge, get the same
result as if higher profits had been specifically
permitted.
This Bill puts a premium on inefficiency
and subterfuge. I venture to suggest, and I
do so reluctantly, that the expectation is that
if section 7 becomes workable at all it will
be only through subterfuge. I urge that the
Government, in order to achieve the goal at
which I believe they are sincerely aiming,
should follow the line along which we have
proceeded before. Can they think of a better
one? I do not know of any, and the witnesses before our committee did not. In other
words, I urge there should be a continuation
of the system which provides an incentive to
contractors to keep costs down. If the Government do that, they will be encouraging the
building of an armament industry, which we
must have if we are in earnest. Of course,
if we are only shamming, it does not matter
whether we have an armament industry or not.
We have not to-day any plants equipped
for the big end of essential armaments. Money
will have to be got to equip plants. I ask
honourable members to put themselves in the
position of a man who sets out to get money
for building and equipping plants to turn out
armaments as cheaply as it can be done. Does
anybody think such a man could raise a
dollar if this Bill is to control? The Government have placed such a restriction on profits
that nobody but a simpleton would ever
engage in the manufacture of war equipment
in this country. If this Bill is applied in a
straightforward manner and without contortion, it will drive the manufacture of arms
out of this country. The only possible way
of inducing manufacturers to enter into contracts would be by subterfuge and misinterpretation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend is of course confining himself to section 7.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.
My honourable friend says that section 7 may
not be applied at all; that contracts may be
awarded under tender in every case. I was
not going to touch upon that, because I dealt
with it the other day and I do not like to
repeat myself. In respect of a very high
proportion of contracts of the kind contemplated here you could get only one real
tender: the rest would be fake tenders. I
should not like to give an estimate of the
proportion of contracts in which tenders
would not be practicable, but men who know
about these matters tell me that would be
true of half the contracts. That is because in
so many instances equipment of the type

SENATE
required is produced by only one firm. The
Government were not and are not able to
advertise for tenders for aeroplanes. A royal
commission was infornied that tenders could
not be called for when Bren guns were needed.
It would have been a thousand times casier
to procure tenders for Bren guns from a number of firms than tenders for acroplanos.
If there is any trouble in the application
of this Act over the whole range of defence
equipment, the Government will be faced with
extra costs of many millions. I repeat that
if the Government truly want to provide for
our defence they will have to break away
from this measure.
A serions situation is squarely in front of
us. There will come an hour when our judgment on this Bill will be looked back upon.
I shall at least be able to say then that I
tried to persuade the Government to have
-erious regard for our position and for the
high purpose which should control their conduct, and to amend the Bill so as to make
possible its operation with credit, with real
results and without subterfuge, without fraud
and without dishonesty.
Hon. \Ir. DANDURAND: All I can say
to my right honourable friend is that there
is an outcry against any war profiteering.
Right

lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No contract
wrhich permitted any liberal profit could be
entered into without being viciously attacked
on al the hustings in Canada fron the
Atlantic to the Pacifie.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Forget about
the election.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, let us
forget about the election. But let us remember the reputation, the honour and the
integrity of our publie men. Some of them are
responsible for the government of this country. Vicions criticisms are being made of
large war profits. The contract referred ta
by my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) may indicate that big sums were
made by the contractors. If so, we shall hear
the people say again that profits should not
be permitted on contracts for defence equipment. Because of the state of public opinion
the Government have decided that profits on
contracts given without competition should
be limited to five per cent.
I contest the statement of my right honourable friend, and I do so with some diffidence,
because I do not know that I can successfully
pit my opinion against his. I feel in my
bones that nine-tenths of those contracts will
come under clause 4 and not under clause
Right

Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

7. Those that come under clause 7 will meet
this condition. In many factories work on
contracts will be under way, and the Government will say to the manufacturers, "Will you
take a contract which limits your profits to 5
per cent?" They will be disposed to accept
such contract in order to spread their general
costs over a larger output. If, bowever, they
will not accept that limitation of 5 per cent,
we shall have to bring them to a reasonable
state of mind by stating, "We can place in
Great Britain or the United States a contract
for the very same article upon which you may
hold the advantage of a patent licence, and
thus we shall satisfy the people of Canada
that we are not being blackmailed or held
up by you."
This Bill, as amended, will be returned to
the House of Commons. There, when it was
introduced, opinion was almnost unanimous in
its favour. As honourable senators are aware,
many of the members of that House are
business men. My honourable friend may say,
"Oh, yes, but they are afraid of facing their
electorate after demagogues have charged thei
with voting for a higher profit to enable
manufacturers ta make fortunes ont of war
contracts while our soldiers are risking their
lives in defence of the country." Well, I
repeat, this Bill will be returned to the House
of Commons, and if it is accepted there in
its amended form, experience will show under
what conditions we have been proceeding.
My right honourable friend says, "With
my statement in Hansard, I shall await you
on the day of reckaoing." He will, I think,
admit that neither he nor I claim infallibility,
and I hope ha will not have occasion to point
Lis finger at me and say, "I was right."
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill,
as amended, was read the third time, and
passed.
STATE

OF CANADA'S DEFENCE
DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Sonate
the adjourned
by Hon. Mr.
of the Sonate
Canada.

resumed from Tuesday, May 2,
debate on the question proposed
Griesbach, calling the attention
to the state of the defence of

Hon.
ARTHUR
SAUVÉ:
Honourable
senators, although I am far from sharing
entirely in the opinion of the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach),
I must admit the merit of his speech and his
soldierly frankness. Had the issue al:ways
been discussed with as much fearlessness and
sincerity, the Canadian people would not now
bave their backs to the Tower of Babel. His
fearlessness reminds me of Bourassa.

MAY 4, 1939
The " arsenal speech " of the honourable
gentleman is full of ammunition for the
defence of the British Empire, outside as well
as inside this country. The question he has
raised is submitted with military laconisa
and is skilfully directed towards provoking a
debate on Canadian armament and its usefulness in a war in which Canada would be called
upon to participate.
He is right in asking for an improved militia
and a better military education. It is useless,
ridiculous, even disastrous, to spend millions
of dollars on equipment if soldiers are not
properly educated and trained. Such an
expenditure, instead of being in the interest
of the militia, would rather favour speculators.
Our militia must be strong and capable of
defending us from attack from without and
maintaining order within.
The honourable senator is also quite right
in blaming what he calls the " go-slow," the
" laissez faire " policy, when one million
unemployed would like nothing better than
to be fed and well paid, and at the same time
receive a good training which would be useful
not only from the military standpoint, but also
in the organization of civil life in the best
interests of Canadian production.
But I must differ with the honourable
senator when he extends so far the limits of
our own needs and means. Canada has bled
herself of hundreds of millions of dollars by
participating in extraterritorial wars, which,
like the last one and so many others in the
course of past centuries, have resulted in
foolish geographical disruptions, and consequently in creating centres of hatred and
revenge. The wish of the Canadian people is
to live in peace with the world. In view of
the enormous war debt which we have to
carry, it is not possible to spend additional
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.
The military issue was wrongly raised in the
country. It was useful only for political
exploitation and was recklessly exaggerated.
This is not, it must not be, a racial issue.
It must be governed by common sense, not by
animosity.
I do not know which element the honourable senator from Edmonton referred to as
being opposed to expenditures on armament,
but I must say that such an element is
recruited from all races in the country, and
te would be surprised to hear our people
express their views. It is fair to say that
amongst them are represented the authors,
the sponsors and the educators of Canadian
evolution, and also of the colonial evolution
of the British Empire.
Now, honourable senators, the experience
I have gained in this House prompts me to

307

continue in my own language. But may I
add that, speaking in French, I shall frankly
and respectfully express my views without
any feeling of acrimony, prejudice or narrowmindedness. My natural and logical sympathies are with England and France, whose
alliance is now happily the emblem of the
two mother-races in Canada. On their part,
the French Canadians have no feeling against
the two great nations, the sources of all that
is best in Canadian civilization-a civilization
for which they will always nourish sympathy
and gratitude. Our reasoned opposition to
participation in war is simply directed to the
question of Canadian interest, of interpretatien of our status, and, above all, of ways and
means and needs.
The central Government, enlightened by
strong, impartial, competent authorities, should
find a truc definition, a truc sense of our status
as a nation. It should find also a way to
teach an official doctrine in every part of the
Dominion through our schools and universities,
and the editors of the press. This work is
urgent and should be undertaken before we
speak of Canada again participating in war
beyond our shores.
(Translation) Honourable senators, need
I repeat that this question is not a subject
.for religious controversy?
To those who
might still entertain the petty notion that
the French Canadians are misled by their
clergy, I may say that they are entirely
wrong, and I would remind them of the highminded and Christian teachings of glorious
Pius XI and of his most worthy successor. I
would remind them also that the Catholic
hierarchy, the high officials of the clergy,
in the province of Quebec as elsewhere,
have always firmly supported royal authority,
even at the risk of creating rare and discreet
discord. On his return from Rome and other
European countries, especially Poland, His
Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve addressed his
clergy in a letter which shines with the light
of history and is replete with Christian
loyalty, dogmatic observance and Christian
respect for established authority-for the
British Crown. When the Prime Minister
of England, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, for
whom we all entertain such deep sympathy,
called on the Vatican, we did not fail to be
impressed and to appreciate such an example
of Christianity and of high-mindedness; and
we contrasted his behaviour with that of the
Fuehrer when te visited Italy.
Our reasonable opposition is simply based
on the question of Canadian interest, a question of interpretation of our status as a
nation; above all, a question of means.

SENATE
The central Government, enlightened by
scrupulously impartial, evidently efficient experts, should have given Parliament a true,
clear definition of our status. Once it was
accepted, the Government should have found
the means of teaching it as official doctrine
in all parts of the country, in our institutions
of learning, in the press, etc. Such teaching
is more imperative than the present discussion
on the duty or the opportunity of participating or not participating in the impending war.
The question of participating in the wars of
Great Britain has the highest but a different
interest for Canadians, ever since Queen
Victoria's Jubilee in 1897, when the Prime
Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
addressing England, proclaimed: "Sound your
clarions, light your bonfires on your hills, and
Canada shall answer your call'
Especially
since the Laurier Cabinet decided for the
first time to co-operate with England for the
There
conquest of South Africa in 1899.
never was a question which aroused so much
controversy, taught so many bad lessons, so
much falseness, engendered so much hypocrisy,
so many divisions and se many disasters. Our
people were never so badly deceived as over
this question. After the South African War,
they were persuaded that it would be "the
most suicidal policy that could be devised for
Canada to enter the vortex in which the
nations of Europe, England included, are
engaged at the present time and which compels
them to maintain great military armaments."
Those were Laurier's words in 1902. Because
of his sincerity we were taught that it would
be a crime to oblige Canada, "with an immense
territory, but with a sparse population scattered
over an area 3,000 miles in extent from east te
west, with a heavy budget of public works, yes,
to oblige Canada to divert any part of that
necessary expenditure to the supply of guns,
cannon and military equipment." Again I am
quoting Sir Wilfrid Laurier, speaking in the
House of Commons on April 15, 1902. At
the time he was the great leader of the
electoral majority of the country, a majority
which he retained in 1904 and 1908.
Such was the education the Canadian people
received from their main political leaders,
before British Imperialism made serious
progress. Since then, one of the most brilliant
minds of the century, the Canadian best
informed on matters of universal history,
Henri Bourassa, truc to his past, to his
political mandate, made himself the passionate
propagandist of such national education. His
incomparable and popular eloquence was
especially powerful among the young, in whom
he inspired sentiments which soetimes were
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

expressed in violent language, and provoked
exaggerated attitudes from all sides.
Mr.
Monk, the Conservative leader in the province
of Quebec, a great scholar, whose moderate
language and distinguished manners made
him a commanding figure, allied himself with
Mr. Bourassa, a step which made a profound
impression in the whole country, but particularly in Quebec. In 1910, he suggested submitting the question to the electorate, as did
the right honourable leader to the left (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) in 1926 in Montreal. It
would be a great and serious errer to let
people believe that the anti-militarists and the
anti-participationists were to be found only
among French Canadians. It would also be
a great injustice against the French Canadians,
who would thereby be represented as enemies
of England.
I need not quote here the views of Adam
Shortt, of Goldwin Smith, of Professor
Marshall, of the Granges of Ontario, etc. And
lately, did not the member for Selkirk, Mr.
Thorson, professer in the University of Manitoba, show himself in the Commons to be
most radically opposed to compulsory participation?
Since then, the thousand millions spent by
Canada in the late war. have increased the
number of oppositionists throughout the
country. The opposition is to a defence policy
too expensive for our means, to a participation
which would exact ruinous sacrifice.
That
does not mean that those who believe in a
pacifist policy are indifferent, careless before
the threats of war which may provoke interference from France and England. Their
sympathy, for the greatest part at least, goes
to the two great powers to which we are
attached by sentiment and reason, even if
they deplore, like so many others in England
and in France, the weakness of the two great
democracies and the fatal errors committed by
them against young, fresh dictatorships which
have proved themselves efficient for production and aggression. Let us net believe that
everything is for the best in our democratie
regime, nor that all is reprehensible in the
new dictatorships.
Canadians believe that Canada, an adult
country, an independent nation, should have
a proper militia, but without running the risk
of falling into the vortex of European militarism. The interest of Canada, our vital
intérest, lies in showing to the world a definite
attitude as a pacifist nation, and extreme care
in avoiding so far as possible the vengeful
North
enmity of the aggressor countries.
America may rise to world supremacy through

MAY 4, 1939
economie lines, tbrougb frank aversion towards
international quarrels and wars. The character
of the new world must differ from the nervous,
bellicoýse temperament of the ofld European
civilization. If Canada does flot live up to
its exact part as a member nation of the
Commonwealth, we shaîl feul to attain the bigh
station which belongs to us. FronX both sides,
we might be exposed to exeggeration. Canada
should rise to the position which belongs to us,
but not an inch further. We have reached our
majority, but let us not follow the exemple of
the son and heir who, in one year, dissipated
a fortune hoe had thought inexhaustible.
If our independence sbould corne to mean
a vexatious interdependence. it would be better to decide on it at once.
Before we
involve our country in European conflicts we
sbould study the causes of sucb confliets. We
have no rigbt to commit our country ligbtly.
There bas been much talk latel3y of the conquests of Hitler and Mussolini, no thougbt
being given to the fact that' these conquests might amount simply to resumption of
ownersbip.
Albanie, the kcy to the Adriatic, is of
speciel interest to Italy, because of the mandate conferred on Italy in 1919 and abro-gated
by the treaty signed at iRapallo. Is it true
that in 1919 England and France were ready
to give Italy a mandate -over Albanie? Mr.
André Tardieu, lately *Prime Minister of
France, states it positively.
And Danzig? Is it true that it is a large
city whose people are German, a city governed
by "elected" men who are dependants of the
Polisb Government? Is it true also thet the
railroad station is Polisb and the post office
German?
Well thon, would it be worth while for
Canada to sacrifice or risk its future tbrough
a war due to such details of rather local interest? Neither France nor England is attacked;
they might be if they interfered to defend
frieýndly nations wbich are strangers to Canada.
In the study of our problems let us not
forget the extraordinary and quick evolution
of the world. It is the duty of our real leaders
to keep the Canýadien people well informed
as to contemporary ideologies and their conflicts, which, according to Mr. F. R. Scott,
professor of law at McGill university, are
of great importance in the study of international problems. Our public mon would ýbe
more at ease if the electors entertained, not
felse ideas, but exact notions as to geographie
realities and commercial routes, end on the
inevitable influence of seas on the trade of
the world. They sbould be in a better position to act according to our national interests
if our people were kept bonestly posted as to

309

causes, conflicts, aggressions, dlaims and wars
in Europe.
As the honourable leader of the Government knows better than enyono else, the
future holds very difficult problemns in store.
Immigration is one of tbem. In the lest
thirty years bas it flot deformed the mentality of the country et the expense of our best
institutions, in defiance of our most beautifui traditions?
Its audacious advance in
trade and indu'4ry, with the evident desire
tc control politics and the economic strengtb
of our country, should inspire the two great
races of the country with a salutary fear,
and give us furtber reason for uniting in the
înterest of the institutions dear to all of us.
Most of the money spent on military affairs
in the lest third of a century was used for
extraterritorial wars, in 1899 and 1914. And
we speut tbuo billions notwitbstaîidiug thîe
pi-omises made to the people by botb parties
in turn. The people were deceived, end it is
no wonder they fedl ever more strongly against
armement policies. Tbey are more logical,
more sincere then some governments.
I repeat that the bon. member for Edmnonton (Hon. Mr. Griosbacb) and bis supporters
are right in demandîng a well organized, well
equipped and well educated Canadien militia.
But it is essontial that it should be proportionate to our needs andl to our meens.
Our militery education is not what it used
to be. Fifty years ego, theo parislios in the
province of Quebec hed completely organized
battalions with practical drilling. People
were prepared for the defence of the country,
and they knew their preparation was for that
purpose, and for that elone. We bad not
yet been doceived. It is ridiculous, unjuet
and barbarous to send to the battlefield young
men who are utterly devoid of military training and moral preparation in thet respect.
That is wbat bas been done in the lest
tbirty years. The Goveroment is preparing
to send our young men to the firing-line
while promising them they shall not go. The
people have been deceived. Tbey bave been
exploited witb wer stories. Remembor the
ugly incident of 1930, just beforo the election,
when Salse rumours of a war witb Turkey
were spread for the sole purpose of saying
that the liSe-blood of Canadiens would agein
flow over the bettlefields overseas, if Bennett
were elected. It is in sncb dishonest feshion
that our people bave too often been exploited,
and it is because of this education based on
Salseboods that all
military orgenization
erouses fears, prejudice and radical opposition
in the country. Better than eny one else, the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurend) will understand to whet I
refer witbout insinuating anytbing.

SENATE
In 1910 the Laurier Government plunged
the country into the vortex of armaments,
forcing us into the construction of a war navy,
and passing the Naval Service Act, section
22 of which says:
The Governor in Council (i.e. the Government) may place the Naval Forces, or any part
thereof, on active service, at any time when
it appears advisable so to do by reason of an
emergency.
Then section 23 specifies that "in case of
an emergency, the Governor in Council may
place at the disposal of His Majesty for
general service in the Royal Navy, the Naval
Service or any part thereof." That Act is
still on our St.atute Book, as well as the
Militia Act of 1904, which authorizes real
conscription. Is it or is it net truc? The
section on definitions, 2 (d), explains that
emergency means war, invasion, etc.
Then, from 1914 to 1918, Canada was
plunged into the vortex of militarism, with
the consent of both parties in Parliament.
Now, twenty years later, when the country
is net yet out of the abyss, Parliament, on
the Government's advice, sinks us in further
[hrough a policy of defence and military
participation, the cost of which no one can
foresee. This is done at a time when our
debt for participating in the last war is
over a billion of dollars; when our national
budget alarmingly and unexpectedly reveals
a deficit; when the demands of government
exact more than $50000,000 above the revenue,
increased through additional taxation; when our
farmers eau survive only through abnormal
subsidies frein the State; wben our manufacturing industries leave out on the street
hundreds of thousands, and our commerce is
left more and more in the hands of a monopolizing, revolting plutocracy. And all this
after our population in Quebec bas been told
that with the Right Hon. William Lyon
Mackenzie King, grandson of a patriot of
1837, at the bead of affairs, Canada would
never take part in foreign wars; the rest
of the population being told that the King
Cabinet wouldl never "do anything without
the
authorization
of
Parliament." The
Prime Minister often made that high-sounding statement, although he, better than anyone else, knew the obligation bad been defined
in section 24 of the Naval Service Act of
1910:
Whenever the Governor in Council places the
Naval Service or any part thereof on active
service, as provided in the two preceding sections, if Parliament is then separated by such
adjournment or prorogation, as will net expire
within ten days, a proclamation shall issue for
a meeting of Parliament within fifteen days,
and Parliament shall accordingly meet and sit
upon the day appointed by such proclamation,
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

and shall continue to sit in like manner as if
it had stood adjourned or prorogued to the
same day.
Is that section still on the Statute Book of
Canada? Yes. Has the Naval Service Act
been amended since? I do net think so. Is
the real conscription Act, the Militia Act of
1904, still thé law of the land? Yes.
Through section 24, the Government alone,
without authorization of Parliament, may
place our military organization and our navy
on active service, Parliament being able only
to approve or condemn the action of Government. That is what happened in 1899 and in
1914. The present Government cannot claim
such policy as peculiar to itself. But those
statements were made in order to delude our
people once more. Consequently the Prime
Minister proceeded vith the greatest hesitancy, the greatest circumlocution-and what
great skill!-to state in veiled sentences his
Government's policy on foreign affairs. The
Minister of Justice, with his great ability, was
also called to the rescue to forestall fatal
heart failure anong several of the members
who felt themselves threatened-among those
political patriots whose shaking hands are still
stained with the blood of the Bordens and the
Meighens. Some of them, rather than betray
their promises and jeopardize their terrestrial
salvation, preferred to disobey their political
leaders. But what ssems te me most strange
and illogical is the behaviour of those members who verbally oppose all foreign participation, as well as conscription, who roundly
denounce the conscription part of the Militia
Act, but none of whom bave yet dared bring in
a resolution with the object of repealing that
section of the Militia Act. I shall dispense
with reading the clauseHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Read it, so that
I may bear the law you are speaking about.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ:
it

With pleasure.

Here

is:

The Governor in Council may place the
Militia, or any part thereof, on active service
anywhere in Canada and also beyond Canada,
for the defence thereof, at any time when it
appears advisable so te do by reason of
emergency.
The Governor in Council means the Government.
Now, bere is section 8, chapter 132 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, enacting
compulsory military service:
All the male inhabitants of Canada, of the
age of eighteen years and upwards, and under
sixty, net exempt or disqualified by law, and
being British subjects, shall be liable to service
in the militia: Provided that the Governor

MAY 4, 1939
General may require all the male inhabitants of
Canada, capable of bearing arms, to serve in
the case of a levée en masse.
How is it that not one of the members, at
the time of the revision of the Statutes in
1927, dared ask that these sections should be
struck off? I wonder how it is that in the
course of this session not one member has
dared so far to ask for the repeal of these
clauses, when all of them proclaim their
opposition to all participation in wars outside
Canada.
The Right Honourable Prime Minister
(Right Hon. Mr. King), the honourable
leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
the right honourable leader on the left (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) all maintain that the
axiom, "When England is at war, Canada is
at war," does not mean that Canada undertakes to participate in all of Great Britain's
wars. Well then, if in some cases Canada has
the right, nay the duty, of refusing to participate in one of England's wars, without thereby
being forced to withdraw from the British
Empire, why have we not that right to-day
with regard to the war being prepared so
ambiguously, so equivocally, through pretence
based on ambition and bitterness, after a
division of spoils which carried in itself germs
of revenge? Why should we not have the
right to remain neutral with our scepticism
towards entangling alliances, and before the
violence of problems risen in that Europe
which is nothing but a network of old
antagonisms? Will these ineffectual alliances
not necessitate another new map? But if the
conflict became universal, Canada might do
her share voluntarily, freely, limiting her
effort, according to her judgment, to ber
natural resources and her industrial production.
If Canada, as an independent nation, remained neutral, how could Germany seize
her, even if Germany defeated England? How
could it be done, when we have as our
neighbours the United States, who would
have to be reckoned with, as well probably
as an American League of Nations?
If there were a possibility, in the course of
the impending war, of a German attack
against Canada. would it not be another reason for keeping our militia, our soldiers at
home, for the defence of our coasts while
awaiting help from the United States and
from the Commonwealth of which we represent the twenty-seventh part? The Canadian
army would be of small importance in a war
such as may break out any moment, but it
could at least guard our Pacifie coast efficiently.
However, to show that we entertain neither
aversion nor bad feelings towards England,
we would not be opposed to Canada leaving

311

Canadians free to fight in the British army.
If necessary, Canada should be ready to supply
England and her allies with munitions, with
the products of our larms and our factories.
But it should be according to the decision of
ber Parliament, after it had been elected
with that mandate, and according to how and
why war had been started. In a word, Canada
must know where to lay the blame for the
conflagration.
Participation by Canada, proposed by our
Government and adopted by Parliament,
should be voluntary and at the expense of
England, who is rich enough to finance other
countries. Loyal to their King, in sympathy
with England, Canadians should be left free
to go and fight with Great Britain, with the
Mother Country, but not at the expense of
our country, whose revenues are too small
and whose obligations are too heavy to justify
such a burden. Besides, did not Sir Gerald
Campbell, British High Commissioner, state
recently that the Great Britain-United StatesCanada treaty represents for Canada a considerable sacrifice for the benefit of Great
Britain and the United States? Our volunteers
would represent a human capital which should
be taken into account. After the Great War,
Sir Robert Borden notified England that
Canada would not be able to repeat the 1914-18
efforts. Yet our economic position at that
time was far from being as precarious as it
is to-day, because of the depression which
endures and causes such ruin, and empties
the coffers of the State.
Our federal, provincial and municipal debts
amount to-day to $7,162,000,000, leaving out
the debts of the different churches. This
indebtedness weighs upon the shoulders of ten
and one-half million people.
French Canadians are not against voluntary
enlistment, for they entertain for Great
Britain and France a real and preferential
sympathy. It would be imprudent on their
part to object to this sort of voluntary participation at the expense of England. They do
not care to act in a way which will create
prejudice, grievances and hatred against themselves. And after the war is over, England
should also grant to our Canadian soldiers
the preference in the civil service granted
in our own to the British soldiers.
Our governors ask our people to economize
in order to help the country out of the
financial morass. The State should set the
example and not parade undue luxury when
the country is threatened with the terrible
suffering which will afflict the world if another
war starts. In expenditures for armaments as
well as in all others, the Government should
consider not only our future needs, but also

312

SENATE

our prosent means in view of our future needs.
Think of it, our debt is over seven billions!
I agree with the honourable leader of the
Opposition in the House of Commons (Hon.
Mr. Manion), the first leader who had the
courage to declare against conscription. Those
their
against conscription cannot refuse
admiration to this evolution loyally accepted
by a party which numbers many loyalists and
imperialists who are proud and happy to live
within the British Empire, to fight by its
side and to trade with Great Britain and the
Commonwealth. Let us also give due appreciation to the statement of the Prime Minister
against military conscription; let us not lose
sight of that statement. Those who approve
this attitude of the Prime Minister should be
honest enough, sincere enougb net to deceive
public opinion about the Conservative leader
and other members of the Opposition who
entertain the same views as the Prime Minister.
Honourable Mr. Manion was a glorious
volunteer during the Great War. He joined
the heroes in the trenches without waiting for
the law to force him there. He saw the worst
horrors, as well as our errors. As a good,
experienced Canadian, he states that conscription is one of the errors we should net repeat.
lis opinion is of exceptional value.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That goes back to
1917.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: My honourable friend
speaks with the voice of the past.
Mr. Manion is in favour of Canadian
participation, but would rather that we contributed food than men and money. His
opponents who are trying, in the province
of Quebec, to turn the public against him,
because he joined the army voluntarily as a
young physician in 1914, are unjust, dishonest,
and their actions in that respect are worthy of
contempt.
Canada is able to feed the French-British
armies and those of their allies with her
inexhaustible resources. What a great contribution, recognized as such in 1917 when the
Borden Government exempted from conscription all those considered necessary to national
production. Unhappily, that Act was exploited
in an odious manner, wbich became an
injustice. Our population, already inadequate
for our territorial needs, may contribute
products, but it would be imprudent for
Canada, even for Great Britain, if many of
our men were taken to the trenches. Moreover, most of our young men have no military
training whatever. They are utterly unready,
both physically and morally, for military
service. It would be cruel and barbarous to
conscript these young men who have been
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

given no notion of love of flag, of national
pride, no military spirit. If the Government
is of the opinion that Canada is obliged to
participate in all wars where England is
concerned, it should long ago have directed
popular education accordingly. It would have
been fairer and more courageous than to make
those young men believe they would never go
to war as long as Messrs. King and Lapointe
are at the head of the Government.
The duties of Canadians, the lessons of the
flag and examples of bravery should be taught
in peace-time. Then should love of country
be inculcated. It would hardly be fitting to
reproach Canadians for their wish for peace
when we are so ill prepared for war. Besides,
whv have France and Great Britain so far
sacrificed their pride in such a way as to avoid
war? Because they were not prepared to face
the enemy. We are in the same position teday. Why should we show such enthusiasm
in Canada for conscription when England faces
it reluctantly and accepts it with hesitation
and repugnance, over violent opposition which
comnes close to disloyalty, and deliberately
weakens the negotiations of Mr. Chamberlain
and his Government, If T, a French Csnadian,
sat in the British Parliament, I should be
ashamed of such bebaviour and example.
But I must say that if we had a general
election, and a war started in Europe, and
the samie leaders favoured conscription, I
would deny them the right to apply it without consulting the people, before obtaining
authorization from the parliamentary majority
of the elected reprosentatives o f the people,
either by way of an election or a referendum.
If they did net adopt that course, they would
be the object of popular indignation, and
might provoke a revolution which would
destroy our parliamentary system and Confederation.
In all conscience, with the knowledge I have
of my country. with the respect due to the

authority of our King, with the knowledge of
history, of economie geography, in which we
are deeply interested, I cannot decoive my
compatriots by stating that never, never should
Canada take part in a foreign war. For
example, what if Japan were to attack the
United States to-morrow, and the latter called
If to-morrow the King of
for our help?
Canada were unjustly, brutally attacked and
seme part of the Empire threatened with collapse, if lie were to call on us to assist him,
rould we refuse to leave Canadians, who are
at the same time British subjects, frce to
respond to the call? No, we should place at
his service, if not men, at lecast all the munitions and food that we could supply. Would
it be possible to refuse that kind of conscrip-

MAY 4,1939
tion? No, no. To those who answer yes, I
would say: If the United States, allies of
England, flew to her defence, what should we
do? If they asked us to join with them in
the defence of the interests of the King of
our country, if Australia were attacked, for
instance, we should be unable to refuse. Let
us be honest. The Canadian people expect
it of us; they are disgusted with circumlocution, displeased because they are kept too
much in the dark by their governors. Let us
tell the truth. There has already been too
much false education.
My attitude to-day is the same that I
adopted in 1914-18, when I was openly against
conscription. I respect those who do not share
my opinion, yet I maintain that we must act,
not through antipathy towards England and
France, not absolutely refusing to sympathize
and contribute, but with the desire to safeguard the future of our country, dear above
all others. Canada First!
I express myself in this way without any
ulterior thought of political ambition. Advancing years and my position have put an end to
my electoral activities, but I love my country
more than ever, and until my dying breath I
shall keep the desire to serve its best interests,
always to be worthy of the popular mandate
which was left in my hands for over twentyfive years.

-Hon. Mr. Marshall.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: To-morrow.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I hope that when the House debates
this Bill and the preceding one, which have
been set down to be read a second time
to-morrow, there will be someone present
who bas had time te give attention to the
constitutional phase of each. They are both
the same as respects constitutional difficulties.
It will be recalled that a Bill entirely similar
in purpose te these Bills, though different in
method, passed this House in 1934, was in
operation for two or three years, and was then
finally declared ultra vires. I have not had
time to read all the debate in the Commons
on these two measures, but I have read much
of it. I should have thought justification of
the Bills from the constitutional point of view
would have been. discussed, but, so far as
I have been able to read, no reference was
made to that. Therefore, though I am not
taking issue on the constitutional phase-for I
have net had time te study either the judgment in relation to the 1934 Bill, or these Bills
as compared with that one-I certainly think
this House, even more tiae the other House,
should give the very closest consideration to
that topic. I hope, thcrcfore, that when thesc
Bills come up to-morrow someone on the
Covernment side of the House can speak on
the subject, and also that someone on this
side will be able to speak more authoritatively
than J can, in view of the work I have to
do between now and to-morrow.
I think we

of the purport of the legislation.

BRITISEI COLUMBIA-ALASKA HIGHWAY
DISCUSSION

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to a proposai for the construction of a military
motor road f rom the United States houndary
through Canadian territory to the United States
territory of Alaska.
He saiel: Honourable senators, the matter to
which I desire to dra-w the attention of the
House is a proposai to construct a motor
hîghway from some point on the road system
of the United States, through Canada, to the
American territory of Alaska. The proposai
is largely sponsoreel by the Premier of British
Columbia. In brief, the proposai is that the
money shail be suppliced by the Unitedl States,
tbough that point lias not yet emergeel as
cicarly as it probably wili ultimately. Coupled
with the advance of the money necessary for
the cost of construction is the further proposai
that tbe road shahl be made availabie to the
United States in time of war, for the movement
of troops andl military supplies.
Hon. Mr. PARRuS: May I ask my honourable frienel who bias proposed that the road
.shoulel ho made available to the Unitedl States
in time of war?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is proposeel in
a Washington dispatch, which I shahl read
presently. Discussion in the newspapers of
British Columbia bears out my statement. I
do flot see how any.one from that province
can ho ignorant of that aspect of the matter.
The proposai is made attractive hy the
suggestion tha t it will contribute to the tourist
trade and aiso will open up the country.
The estimateel cost of construction is anywhcre from $20,000,000 to $50,000.000. A commission lias been set up in the Unitedl States
by the American Qovernment, andl another
commission hias been set up in Canada by the
Canadian Government, for the purpose of
going further into the matter. Here it hias
been covereel hy an Order in Council, No. P.C.
3252 of December 22, 1938. After the, usual
opening, the Order proceeds:
That the Premier of B3ritish Columbia has
repeatedly emphasized the important and beneficial resuits which, in his opinion, would follow
froni the decision to construct a highway which
would unite the road system of British Columbia
and the Yukon Territory with that of Alaska;

SENATE
That representations have been received from
the United States Government with regard to
the desirability of providing for the construction of such a highway;
That pursuant to the passage of a Bill through
Congress instructing and empowering the President of the United States to appoint a Commission of five persons "to co-operate and communicate directly with any similar agency which
may be appointed in the Dominion of Canada
in a study for the survey, location, and construction of a highway to connect the Pacifie Northwest part of continental United States with
British Columbia and the Yukon Territories in
the Domini',n of Canada and the Territory of
Alaska," the President did appoint a Commission consisting of the following persons:
Congressman Warren G. Magnuson, Seattle,
Wash.
Dr. Ernest Gruening, Director, Division of
Territories and Island Possessions, Department of the Interior, Washington
Donald McDonald, Engineer, Alaskan Road
Commission, Fairbanks, Alaska
J. W. Carey, Public Works Administration,
Portland, Oregon
L. W. Riggs, Former Governor of Alaska,
New York;
That the United States Commission was
further emnpowered te discuss "plans for the
financing of the construction and maintenance
of the said road";
That it is expedient that the Canadian Government should have before it a full report on
all aspects of the proposed construction before
any decision with regard thereto is taken.
The Minister, therefore, with the concurrence
of the Minister of Mines and Resources, recommends:
1. That a Commission of five persons be
appointed to enquire into the engineering,
economic, financial, and other aspects of the
proposal to construet the said highway te
Alaska and to meet for the purpose of discussion and exchange of information with the
United States Commission appointed for that
purpose, and subsequently to submit te His
Excellency the Governor in Council a report
setting forth the evidence received and the
conclusions drawn therefrom;
2. That the following persons be appointed
for this purpose:
Honourable Charles Stewart, Ottawa (Chairman),
Brigadier-General Thomas L. Tremblay, Quebec,
J. M. Wardle, Esquire, Department of Mines
and Resources, Ottawa,
Arthur Dixon, Esquire, Department of Public
Works, Victoria,
J. W. Spencer, Esquire, Vancouver.
3. That authority be granted for the payment
of the necessary and legitimate travelling
expenses, during the current fiscal year, of the
members of the Canadian Commission from
Vote No. 530, S.E. 1938-39, of the Department
of Mines and Resources.
The Committee concur in the foregoing recommendations and submit the same for approval.
E. J. Lemaire,
Clerk of the Privy Council.
It is by virtue of this Order in Council that
the body was created which at the present
moment is, I understand, in consultation with
the American commission.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

The only revenue possible from this proposed road would be by way of tolls. It
is net a commercial proposition in any sense;
it is simply a military road. I am not unfamiliar with the devices which might be
adopted to conceal the fact that the money
was being found in the United States. We
are familiar with the formation of a company
which would sell its bonds there, the money
to reach this country.
What should interest everybody is the
nature of the agreement te be entered into.
Its sole purpose would be to aid the naval
and military situation of the United States
in case of a conflict. A glance at the map
discloses that the Territory of Alaska is
continued in an easterly and southerly direction by a chain of islands which are at this
moment being fortified by the United States.
Drawing a line through. them down south
through the Hawaiian Islands gives you the
naval outposts in the defence system of the
United States.
At present the only means of communication from the mainland of the United States
to their fortified possessions in the Aleutian
Islands is roughly 2,000 miles by sea. If we
take for instance a shipment of 10,000 tons,
the whole of that quantity of goods may
move in one ship and arrive intact at its
destination in six or seven days. If the
proposed road were constructed, and the same
quantity of goods were to be moved a similar
distance, it would require 2,000 five-ton trucks
with 4,000 drivers, at ton times the cost,
and with inconvenience and other frictional
factors. It is obvious that the road is net in
competition with sea-borne traffec at all, and
it can b of no value whatever except for
military purposes. It would be urgently
needed only if the United States lest control of the north Pacifie ocean in a war with
Japan. Thon, of course, it would have an
outstanding value to the United States.
In a speech which I made to this House in
1934, and which will be found at page 509
of the Senate Hansard of that year, I discussed at considerable length the duties, obligations and responsibilities of this country
in connection with the maintenance of our
neutrality in the event of a war between the
United States and Japan. I pointed out that
if we permitted the Japanose to use our coast
for the purpose of harrying American trade,
and we were unable or unwilling to maintain
our neutrality by the exorcise of proper air,
military and naval force--which I thought was
our position thon, as I think it still is-the
United States, under international law, would
be entitled to abate the nuisance by forcibly
occupying our ports and harbours to put an
end to the inconvenience they were suffering

MAY 8, 1939
by reason of our failure to maintain our
neutrality, and that if such a thing should
happen it would result in the loss of our
sovereignty.
Let me give honourable members an idea
of the viewpoint of some persons in the
United States. A senator from one of the
southern states has suggested that the United
States should make application to England
for the granting to them of a corridor fifty
miles wide, through Canada, from the Canadian-American boundary to Alaska. I need not
discuss the peculiar views of such persons,
but I would certainly direct attention to the
fact that, having regard to the importance
of the road to the United States in the event
I have described, and the practically entire
uselessness to Canada of such a road meanwhile, we may assume the United States will
not put a dollar into the construction of that
road unless there are assurances by somebody
in Canada that the road will be made available for military purposes in time of war.
A dispatch from Washington, dated February 17 of the present year, describes the formation of these commissions, and so forth, and
concludes with this paragraph:
In return it was believed the United States
would seek Canadian assurances that this country could use the highway for military purposes
in time of national emergency.
In the British Columbia papers from which
I have clippings, that aspect of the matter
has received considerable attention.
I desire to point out that, should war break
out, if that road were built with American
money and some understanding existed as to
the shipment of troops and supplies, or, even
without such an understanding, if we permitted
such shipment, Canada would be guilty of
an unneutral act which would operate to
the disadvantage of Japan. Japan, by international law, would be entitled to rectify
and liquidate that situation by military action
against Canada, and that in turn would bring
us into conflict with Japan almost immediately.
If Canada, not being at war with Japan, consented to an invasion of her territory by
United States forces, she would have lost her
sovereignty by failing in an obligation imposed by international law. There I am stating the international law on this question.
I repeat, if we were to permit the United
States in time of war to use that road for the
transhipment of troops and military supplies,
we should be guilty of an unneutral act and
therefore liable to offensive action on the part
of Japan. In other words, we should be projected into a war in which we might have no
great interest-in which, in fact, we might
have no concern at all.

317

The importance of this matter becomes all
the greater when we remember the recent pronouncement of our Prime Minister, reviving
what I had thought was ancient doctrine,
that when Great Britain is at war Canada is
at war. Quite recently our Parliamentary
Counsel, Mr. OConnor, laid it down that
the Crown is indivisible, and that it is inconceivable that the Crown with respect to the
Kingdom of Great Britain could be at war
and the Crown with respect to the Dominion
of Canada could be at peace with the same
state. The converse of that proposition is
equally true, that, if the Crown with respect
to Canada becomes involved in war, it follows
that we drag in with us the whole Empire.
The point I should particularly like to make
at the moment is this. The discussion so far
is about the construction of a motor highway
extending from the American road system,
through Canada, to Alaska. Canada having
become engaged in that discussion, it follows
that if the proposal received the assent of
Canada, circumstances from then on would
take charge of the situation, and, in the event
of war, would take charge of Canadian national
policy. I desire to protest against any such
possibility. I am willing to discuss on its
mnerits, and by itself, an alliance, defensive
and offensive, between Canada and the United
States, but I object to a discussion of the
mere construction of a road of this kind,

which, by a side wind, may have the effect
of bringing us into a defensive and offensive
alliance with the United States. I go further.
Having regard to the doctrine of the indivisibility of the Crown, while it might be
desirable and in the interest of this country
to discuss an alliance with the United States
respecting the situation on the Pacifie Coast,
we cannot consider such a discussion unless
we bring into it the whole of the Commonwealth and the whole of the Empire. Consequently I draw attention to the discussion as
far as it has gone. What we have now is a
proposal with an active interest behind it.
Two commissions are now sitting, and undoubtedly a report will be made to the Government. This is a matter of outstanding importance, fraught with the possibility of very
serious consequences to this country, and I
hope that no very definite or positive action
will be taken by the Government without
Parliament first having an opportunity to
examine into the matter.from the point of

view not only of the best interests of Canada
itself, but of the Commonwealth and the
Empire as a whole.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, the debate
was adjourned.

SENATE

318
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
REPORT OF PARLIAMENTARY

COUNSEL

Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, with the permission of the House I
should like to move the following resolution:
That the Senate formally acknowledge receipt
of the report made by Mr. W. F. O'Connor,
K.C., Parliamentary Counsel, relating to the
British North America Act and made in
response to the instructions given him by this
House; and that the Senate express to Mr.
O'Connor their appreciation of the work he bas
done-his scholarly research, the accumulation
and arrangement of material, and his able
presentation of his opinions and comments.
I feel, honourable members, that it is fitting
and appropriate that the Senate in this way
record their appreciation of Mr. O'Connor's
work. I had occasion in recent weeks to be
engaged before the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in a constitutional case of importance,
involving a consideration of that field so often
in dispute, in relation to property and civic
rights in the province on the one hand and
the regulation of trade and commerce by the
Dominion on the other. During this controversy I had Mr. O'Connor's book constantly at my side. It is a useful book for
the practising lawyer in constitutional matters
and for the judges who are dealing with these
questions. But its usefulness and interest are
not confined to those concerned with litigation. They extend to all who are students of
the Canadian constitution and the history of
our institutions. It will prove valuable as a
book of reference, and the vigorous opinions
expressed by the author are enlightening and
stimulating. I feel I can speak without prejudice, because J am a firm believer in the
worth of the Privy Council and am strongly
in favour of its present continuance as a Canadian court of appeal.
Mr. O'Connor bas net hesitated to criticize
the judgments of seme of the greatest judges
that court has produced. I do net find, however, that this has crossed my opinion. He
bas net attempted to discover what might
have been the fate of the Canadian Constitution if there had been no Privy Council and
if the British North America Act had been
left to the tender mercies of our Canadian
courts.
In speaking in the highest commendation
>f what Mr. O'Connor bas donc, J would not
veaken that commendation by asserting that
[ agree with all be bas said. It would indeed
be an innocuous and evasive work if be could
have written 700 pages and have had another
lawyer entirely concur. I disagree in some
matters quite definitely. But it is in the field
of controversy that Mr. O'Connor is at his
best, most thought-provoking and stimulating.
Hon.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

I cannot but marvel at the amount of work
he bas done in so short a period of time,
assisted, I believe, only by his most competent
daughter.
I have pleasure in moving this resolution.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am very happy indeed to
hear this resolution. I think it most appropriate that it should come from one who is
not yet a leader of any side in this House
(Hon. Mr. Farris) and should be seconded by
another who is in the same position (Hon.
Mr. Haig). Not being engaged in the practice of law, I have net as yet been able to
make a study of the work which Mr. O'Connor
bas produced, and therefore I cannot speak
of it with such authority or intimate knowledge as is shown by the mover of this resolution. I did, however, have something to do
with naming Mr. O'Connor to perform this
task, for I had the certain confidence that if
be undertook it, no pains would be spared,
no toil would be too much, to carry it to a
Very
useful and serviceable conclusion.
rarely have I met anyone capable of the extremely hard labour Mr. O'Connor puts upon
all he undertakes. He knows no fatigue. He
bas the advantage also of possessing an exceptionally well trained and well ordered legal
mind. We are indeed fortunate in having
his services at our disposal.* From what I
have heard of this book. it is in fact a contribution te the legal literature of our country.
It was net our thought, of course-and in
this I believe the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) will agree
-that Mr. O'Connor should perform this work
especially for the benefit of the legal profession. We felt we should have very particular need of the work here, because it
was only too clear we were on the eve of
discussions of moment as respects our own
Constitution-discussions which will become
very imminent when the report of the royal
commission on the subject is brought down.
We thought we might have Mr. O'Connor's
discussions to enlighten us and his opinion to
guide us, and what be bas produced is, I think,.
going to be very well received.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
abel senators, I may say that I have net had
time to read the whole 700 pages of Mr.
O'Connor's report, but I have gone through
a considerable part of it. I have been surprised at the illuminating statements he bas
made respecting clauses 91 and 92 of the Act,
and the enlarged powers, as .he secs them, of
the federal authorities. Throughout the argument I was inclined to stand with him against
a prominent jurist of the Privy Council who

MAY 8,1939
whittled down the powers of the Federal Parliament. 1 may have to go more deeply into
the subject Vo be convinced of the correctness
of Mr. O'Connor's views on the indivisibility
of the Crown. That is a very big question.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has expressed surprise
at the volume of the information Mr. O'Connor
was able Vo bring before us within so short a
space of time. 1 would remind my honourable
friend of an occasion when * Mr. Thiers,
ex-president of the French Republic, and a
noted historian, was speaking of Egypt. H1e
had given a wonderful history of Egyptian
relations with Europe, and as he came down
from the tribune someone said, "What extraordinary improvisation!1" He replied, "Yes,
an improvisation about which 1 have heen
thinking for the past twenty years." 1 am
quite sure that when Mr. O'Connor brought
his faculties Vo a consideration of the questions
before him he had 'been thinking of them for
quite a number of years. Mr. O'Connor has
been a professor in Dalhousie University,
which has produced many men prominent in
provincial and federal life. In unanimously
supporting the proposal of my right honourable friend that we should co;nfide the work Vo
Mr. O'Connor, I think we showed excellent
judgment.
The motion was agreed Vo.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. E. S. LITLE moved the second
reading of Bill Z2, an Act to incorporate
Prescott and Ogdensburg Bridge Company.
'He said: Honouraible members of the
Senate, some of you may remember that a
Bill similar to this was 'before the Senate
some few years ago. The time allowed Vo the
company incorporated under that Bill elapsed
before any progress was made, sud during the
years of the depression there was no revival
of the company's activities, owing Vo conditions
in Canada and in -the United States.
The petitioners mentioned in the Bill before
us are sîl Canadians living in the town of
Prescott. Incidentally, they own the Prescott
and Ogdensburg Ferry Company. This fact
may allay the unrest in the minds of sume
people regarding the Bill.
The purpose of the Bill, primarily, is ta
enable the proposed company to co-operate
with the St. Lawrence Bridge Commission.
That commission was created some years ago
by the then Governor Roosevelt sud a site
was afterwards chosen for an international
bridge.

319

The legisîstion necessary Vo enable the State
of New York Vo carry on was passcd by
Congress several years ago. That legisiation
lapsed. It was re-enacted only some three
weeks ago. This explains why Bill Z2 is s0
laVe in cominýg hefore. us. As soon as there
seemed to be some prospect of the legisiation
being re-enacted in the United States, the
Bill before us was advertised here sud the
petition finally drawn up.
I do noV know that it is necessary for me
Vo go further into the details of the Bill. IV is
modelled very largely on the one creating
the St. Clair Transit Bridge Company, which,
along with a similar body in the United States,
built the Port Huron-Point Edward bridge,
opened a year ago. 1Vis my intention Vo ask,
if the Senate secs fit Vo pass the second reading
of this Bill, that it be sent Vo the Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs sud Harbours, where
the various clauses can be examined in detail,
and where those who are more closely
associated wîth the undertaking than I am
will be available Vo explain the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am very h.appy Vo support
this Bill. If there is any reason for a special
inquiry, we can have it in the committee.
This Bill brings Vo mind a similar measure
of last session with respect Vo the Niagara
Falls bridge. The Huse will recaîl that the
Qucen Victoria-Niagara Falls Park Commission, which represented the province of
Ontario, I believe, sponsored a Bill for the
erection of a bhridge across the Niagara river,
to take the place of a previous bridge which
was owned *hy the International Railway
Company.
After a considerable battle,
attempts at settlement having failed, the Bill
was withdrawn. I was sympathetic Vo the
building of the bridge under the auspices of
the Ontario Government, only I felt that
there should he some fair settlement of the
dlaims of the original company. I would noV
have supported the company in any exorbitant
dlaims at all. But I read in the press that the
Ontario Goveruiment are going ahcad with a
bridge, although no bull has been presented Vo
Parliament. Such a course apparently has noV
appealed to the honourable senator from
London (Hon. 'Mr. Little), for he is here with
his Bih.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Will the right honourable gentleman allow me? I understand that
the new commission that is being formed has
come Vo an agreement with the American
company, which owned the old bridge that
was carried away. I am noV certain of the
terms, hut I understand they have made a

SENATE
compromise at about $600,000 or $700,000, for
which the commission would acquire the old
company's rights.

THE SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am glad
to hear that, and I am pleased that the
bridge will bc proceeded with. What was
puzzling me was how the Ontario Government could go ahead with a bridge without
having hiad a bill put through here, and I
was curious to know what this Parliament was
going to do about it.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: I understand that the
Dominion Government bave approved all the
plans. The Ontario commission and the
American commission bave come to terms with
the International Railway Company.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I am very
glad to know that. I had not heard it.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I have no objection to our giving second
reading to this Bill, so long as it is understood that in so doing we shall not bo bound
to accept the principle of the measure. If
muy honourable colleague from London (Hon.
Mr. Little) is agreeable to that, I have no
further points to raise, but I should have
something to say in case the second reading
would bind us to the principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It would not.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Hon. Mr. LITTLE moved that Rule 119 be
suspended in so far as it relates to this Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LITTLE moved that the Bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
The motion was agreed to.
RAILWAY COMMITTEE
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I would remind members of the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours that the committee is meeting immediately after the Senate rises.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. HARDY.

CANADIAN

NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right lon. Mr. GRAJIAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours on Bill I 2, an Act to amend the
Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act, 1933.
He said: The committee have examined
this Bill and beg leave to report the same with
the following amendment:
Page 2, line 19, after the word "at" insert
the words "or after."
That is the only amendment. The Bill did not
provide for compensating employees needing a
settlement after the date of their retirement.
I do not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
understand the effect of the amendment. Maybe it is my fault.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The only effect
it has, so far as I can ascertain, is this. As
the clause was drawn, it allowed a settlement
only up to the date of retirement. This amendment shows that settlement may be made after
the retirement.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure
of honourable members to concur in the
amendment made by the committee to this
Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am informed
The
I did not state that quite correctly.
amendment refers, not to the retirement, but
to the coming into force of the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
understand it yet. Is the effect of the amendment to compel the companies to go back?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I read the
section as it came to us in committee?
"employee" means any person in the service of
National Railways or Pacifie Railways for compensation at the date of the coming into force
of this schedule.
That made no provision for employees who
might enter the service after this measure
came into force. So the subsection has been
made to read:

MAY 9,1939
"employee' means any person in the service of
National Railways or Pacifie Railways for compensation at or after the date of the coming into
force of this schedule.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Shall the motion
for concurrence carry?
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, when this important Bill was before
the House for second reading I expressed myHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does not my
honourable friend feel that he would have
more leeway on the motion for third reading?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I shal not be
here. When this Bill came before us for
second reading I expressed my disapproval of
its provisions, and I have had no reason since
to change my mind.
The Hon. Minister of Transport, Mr. Howe,
made last night a very fair presentation of the
Bill before the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. He stated
that when the representatives of the big international union waited upon him in regard
to this proposal, he pointed out that it was
a matter for them to settle with whatever
railway they happened to be employed by,
and that he should not be expected to ask
the Government to interfere. The railway
men had one or two conferences and then
came back and said they wanted the proposed compensation to be made statutory.
The Minister wanted to know on what ground
they based their request. It was their opinion
that such compensation as they were advocating could be made effective only by legislation.
The various railway representatives who
appeared before the standing committee last
night were asked to point to any place in the
Acts of 1933 and 1935 where there was any
justification whatsoever for claiming that compensation should be made statutory. They
were unable to do so, and I am satisfied that
there is not a single member of the legal profession in this House-I may go further and
say I do not think there is one at all-who
could find in the Acts of 1933 and 1935 any
justification for the claim of the railway men
that their request could be met only by legislation. I am still strongly of the opinion
that compensation is a matter for the employees to settle with the railways. I was
pleased to hear the Vice-President of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, Mr. D. C. Coleman,
make the statement that during the fifty years
of its existence the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
with its vast number of employees, had never
had the slightest difficulty in regard to this
matter.

This honourable House will wonder, then,
what has caused the big international union
to press so strorgly for this legislation. The
answer is not far to seek. Truc, the railway
employees want compensation as set forth in
this Bill, but they are out for something
much bigger. They are not at all pleased
with the co-operative measures that have
taken place, and they believe that if this Bill
passes this House it will absolutely prevent
any further successful attempts at co-operation. I would ask the House to bear with me
while, for the purpose of substantiating this
argument, I quote from reports of railway
employees' meetings, some held in the United
States and some in Canada. I shall quote first
from the statement of the Co-operative
Legislative Committee, Division No. 4, Railway Employees Department, American Federation of Labour, which appears in the
official organ, The Federated Railwayman.
March 8th: Conference at Ottawa, the Minister of Transport presiding. Representatives
of railways expressed agreement with principle
of compensation protection, but C.P.R. declined
to enter conference with 'hands tied" to legislation. Further conference was then agreed to
and arranged by Minister, a draft bill to be
prepared as basis discussion.
Then I refer to a conference at Montreal:
March 27: Conference at Montreal, Mr.
Matthews presiding. Redraft of bill by Mr.
Matthews assisted by sub-committee was discussed, conference concluded about 6 p.m., after
all items had been reviewed. At conclusion,
railways, being urged to state their position,
said in effect that they were not prepared to
sponsor legislation which would nullify benefits
of co-operative measures directed by the Act;
but C.N.R. indicated agreement with legislation
covering subject, but thought it was responsibility of Government.
Now I quote a statement made by Mr.
Fairweather, of the Canadian National Railways, before the special committee of the
Senate on May 11, 193S:
If you entered on that program with an
obligation within that limited scope you conpensate labour for its being displaced, and if
you took into consideration also compensation
of industries that would be dislocated, then you
would not come there at $10,000,000. I quite
admit that. But I do say this. It is based on
an expectation that railway labour would have to
take its chance with every other type of labour
in the country. When a factory finds a better
way of doing its work, it fires some of its men,
and it does net have to compensate them.
I quote now from the London Free Press
of April 24, 1939, reporting the action of the
National Labour Council, which opposed any
plan for further pooling of Canadian Pacifie
and Canadian National services.
A resolution expressing complete opposition
to any plan to pool the C.N.R. and C.P.R.
services any further, and particularly in the

71498-21
REVISED EDITION

322

SENATE

Woodstock to Windsor section, was passed by
the National Labour Council here yesterday.
H. T. Harrison, President of the Council
which represents the various all-Canadian
unions, said the delegates were decidedly
opposed to the latest proposals.
Pooling would certainly lead to amalgamation
and would mean virtual monopoly and the end
of bargain fare excursions enjoyed by the poorer
people to-day because of competition, the delegates believed.
With regard to the scheme to compensate
the men displaced by pooling, it was felt that
this was a scheme to shift the burden from
the railways to the people through the Government.
In pooling or merging the burden of the debt
of the C.N.R. would remain with the Government and benefits accrue to private interests,
according to arguments of the Council.
And here is an extract from the Saskatoon
Star-Phoenix of May 1 of this year, reporting
the action of the Saskatoon Joint Council of
Railway Unions, opposing this proposed
legislation as not going far enough in compensating workers.
A proposal by Senator Dandurand offering
separation allowances and dismissal compensation to workers who might be thrown out of
jobs through possible railway co-operation, was
rejected by the Council, in another resolution.
This resolution demanded that rail employees
be not expected to lose five cents through the
introduction of co-operative measures.
Next I quote from a statement by Robert
Hewitt, Vice-President of the Carmen's Union,
which appeared in Carmen's Journal, an
official organ, on February 23, 1939. Referring
to co-operative measures, he said:
Then there is still another school of thought
in connection with the problem: some prominent
leaders take the view that rather than seek
amendment to the present Act with a view to
protecting the interests of those who might
become displaced as a result of consolidations
here and there, we should concentrate our efforts
upon fighting against such consolidations, that
seeking protective legislation is acquiescing in
such consolidations.
Personally, I do not hold with the latter
view. There certainly is some logic in the fact
that any attempt to get the present Act amended
might be confused with our stand on unification,
but I believe that if Mr. Beatty's suggestion is
courteously, but definitely rejected, first of all,
we would be quite safe and quite free from
getting the two distinct questions confused, if
we later took up the question of securing a
consolidation agreement similar to that now in
force in the United States, which experience
there has shown, has, by lowering the economies
to be effected, caused many proposed consolidations to be withdrawn. I have uno doubt it
would have a similar effect in Canada.
Finally I quote Mr. F. H. Hall, Vice Grand
President, Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and
Station Employees, in the official organ of the
Brotherhood, "The Railway Clerk," for February, 1939. He too was referring to co-operative measures. He said:
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

The possibility that further such steps will
be taken was duly considered.
It was the
opinion of many that in the event the sponsors
of unification are not successful in enforcing
their program, there is great danger of many
more co-operative measures being effected under
the Act, with consequent great loss of employment. Therefore, it was decided to seek an
amendment to the Act, whereby displaced employees would be suitably compensated. This
will have the double effect of protecting those
displaced from the service, and raising the cost
of co-operative measures to the point where they
lose some of their attractiveness to the sponsors.
I think, honourable senators, these various
citations clearly indicate that the men have
at all times had in mind what is manifestly
more important to them, that is, to prevent
so far as they possibly can any further
co-operative measures by either of the two
roads.
When last night Mr. D. C. Coleman, VicePresident of the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
appeared before our committee to express his
disapproval o:f the Bill, but not of the principle of compensation if unification went
through, he said that the officials of the railways could not discuss further co-operation
in any intelligent way, owing to the fact
that they would be unable to find out what
the compensation to railway employees would
arnount to in regard to the particular cooperative measure under consideration, and
that it was essential for them to know what
would be the actual expense. He stated that
the railway wage problem was an intricate
and difficult one, and he did not think that
the executives of the two railway systems
would be able to come to an intelligent conclusion in regard to the cost of any proposal
for co-operation, and therefore could not tell
what the economies would amount to.
In these days of dire stress and strain, of
which we in this country have never seen the
like--I for one have not, though I have lived
the allotted span of "three score years and
ten"-When I think of the thousands upon
thousands of employees who during the past
seven years of the depression have been let
out, to the sorrow and regret of employers,
and reflect that nothing has been done for
those fine men and women, I ask, why should
we have a privileged class in this country?
For once I find myself in agreement with
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock). Often I have heard him
state that he was against class legislation,
because he knew that such legislation was at
the expense of the many. I agree with that
statement, and I say that if this Bill goes
through it will create a privileged class at the
expense of the many.

MAY 9,1939
Let me cite a case which was brought
before the committee last night. Take an
engine-driver of a passenger train drawing a
salary of $250 a month. He is demoted to a
mixed freight. When he takes up bis new
duties bis salary drops from $250 a month
to $225. But does he lose a cent? No, because
if this Bill passes he is compensated $25 a
month, and will draw full salary in bis new
position. That follows through to the conduotor; the brakeman, the station agent, and
so on. The only man who, it seems to me,
gets the short end of the. proposition is the
poor yard-man earning low wages. As my
leader tells me, that man goes out entirely.
To-day everyone with a fairly large income
is heavily taxed. Take my own city of
Montreal. In addition -ta the federal income
tax, we have to pay 20 per cent by way of a
civic income tax. Let me give an instance
of how this heavy taxation depreciates the
value of property. A neighbour of mine died
leaving a house for which he paid $100,000.
To-day bis executors are looking for a buyer
at $10,000, and they cannot find one. Why?
Because to-day, with such heavy taxation, few
men are able to keep up large houses. As
you go down the scale you will find appalling
poverty throughout the country, and especially
in our large cities.
Why should these railway men not stand
their fair share of the burden of taxation?
They now came ta the Government because
they believe this is a very opportune time,
and, virtually with a big stick, like Hitler,
they say: "We will have no further conferences at all. Our demand must be given
statutory effect-or else you know what is
going to happen to you."
I would remind these railway men that in
the Merchant of Venice Shylock took a very
firm stand and demanded his pound of flesh.
We know what eventually happened to him.
There is a growing public opinion from one
end of this country to the other that the
railway men, owing to their entrenched position as members of strong international
unions, are not playing fair with the railways in particular and with Canada in general.
Therefore I for one shall vote against this
Bill.
I am saddened by the thought that if the
Bill does pass, co-operation will not amount
to anything; it will virtually be dead. The
quotations i have read show, in my view,
quite clearly, the ulterior motive of the railway union officials. Instead of our railway
problem being eased, as we hoped it would
be, it will be aggravated. The public are
anxiously waiting to see what this House,
and more particularly our Special Railway
7149&-21j

323

Committee, will do, in the hope that some
scheme may be found to reduce the heavy
annual deficit, and thereby ease the burden
of taxation.
I have expressed my own personal views,
and, as I said a moment ago, if the occasion
arises I shall vote against the Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Shall the motion
carry?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: As I shall
be closing this debate, I would ask whether
any other members desire ta add anything
to my honourable friend's statement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By what
right would the honourable gentleman close
the debate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a Government Bill, and there is a motion before the
House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a motion
by the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: True, but he
has asked me to reply for him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He cannot do
that.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I desire to
state the facts confronting us. We all know
that since 1929 thousands upon thousands of
railway men have been laid off. It is a
stupendous total in relation to the two railway
systems. Those men were laid off because of
the sharp decline in railway business, rendering
their services no longer necessary. Men of
that class are not affected by this Bill. Tomorrow the Canadian Pacific or the Canadian
National may feel the necessity of dismissing
a certain number of men, hundreds or perhaps
thousands, because of reduction in freight or
passenger business, and those men would not
be compensated under this measure.
But it was represented to the Hon. Minister of Transport that a special situation had
arisen which deserved to be examined. It is
that of employees who, because of the Act
of 1933, instructing the two railways to come
together and co-operate in order to effect
economies, are losing their positions. This
Bill covers only that class of men.
The principle of compensation for men displaced in the ordinary course of the business
of the two railways is embodied in the Railway Act. By section 179, where any change
is made by a railway company, railway employees who may suffer financial loss by change
of residence, and so forth, are entitled to
compensation. It is now sought to extend
that principle in favour of men who are laid

SENATE
off through the abandonment of lines or
through pooling arrangements between the
two railways, the compensation to be determined according to a certain scale as set out
in the Bill. To my honourable friend who
has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) this
seems to be exceptional legislation.
On moving the second reading of the Bill I
stated that the Canadian National could, of
course, accept this legislation, inasmuch as
the public treasury would be at the company's disposal if losses were incurred. I
stated also that the Canadian Pacific Railway could well afford to accept this legislation, for Sir Edward Beatty had declared
clearly to the employees of the Canadian
Pacifie, in a letter which I placed on Hansard,
that he was ready to bind himself and his
company to the granting of compensation
to men who would lose their positions
through unification. Last night we heard the
Vice-President of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, Mr. Coleman, who very sincerely said,
"The Canadian Pacific is disposed to grant
compensation to its men." That my honourable friend will admit, and I think he bas
even done so just now. Mr. Coleman said
that the Canadian Pacifie in its long career
had never failed to do the rigbt thing by its
men. I drew his attention to the fact that
since 1933, under the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act. men were laid off to
the number of 169-I think the figure was
mentioned-as a result of co-operation and
pooling arrangements between the two railways, and that no compensation whatever
was granted to them, notwithstanding the
boast of the Canadian Pacifie, as voiced by
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
that the coipany took carc of its men and
gave themn compensation. It bas not done
so under the Act of 1933, and it lias so
admitted.

coming together under co-operation, will lose
their positions, and I have asked in this
Chamber why the Canadian Pacific, which is
ready to declare that it will give compensation
to employees who lose their jobs under unification, will not do so if the employees lose their
jobs under co-operation. Last night the Canadian Pacific Railway did not take that stand. It
said: "We are disposed to accept the idea of
compensating the men, but we believe that the
principle carried into this Bill may be difficult
of application." As a matter of fact, the
Canadian Pacific has declared that it is ready
to give compensation to the men.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sorry to
interrupt my honourable friend so often, but
I was present at the committee meeting last
night also, and my hearing is pretty good.
Mr. Coleman said he was not opposed to
compensation, but that if it was made
statutory he could not see how further cooperative measures could be carried out.
Does the honourable gentleman recall that
occurring?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I am not
quite sure that the Vice-President of the
Canadian Pacific Railway stated that cooperation would be difficult under this BiHHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course we
can see, because we had shorthand writers
present. I am sure, however, that he said
the Canadian Pacifie was favourable to compensating the men laid off under co-operation,
that is to say, under the Bill which we were
discussing. He thought it would be difficult
of application, but be did not submit to the
committee any modified plan which might
be applied more easily.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Except one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Except, perhaps, as to the general declaration that the
Canadian Pacific, like the Canadian National,
was disposed to give compensation to the
men to be laid off under the Act of 1933. I
think my honourable friend will find the
statement was unqualified.
Now, the Senate can reject this Bill, but
the situation will remain the sane throughout the country. Sir Edward Beatty felt
that be needed to give some assurance to
the men who would be laid off. He knows
very well, as all railway men do, that you
cannot put through a scheme of general contraction on the two railways without laying
off thousands of men, and in view of that
situation he made his appeal to the employees.
We have heard my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) say that union railwaymen

in various parts of Canada were opposed to
unification and co-operation because they
feared they would lose their jobs. Undoubtedly that is true. But last week I
asked one of the labour leaders who appeared
before us to state whether labour was
opposed to co-operation and unification just
because men might be laid off. I said, "If
we provide for fair compensation, do you
assert that the country should not lighten its
burden by a reduction of expenditure?" He
pondered for a moment and then said, "Oh,
well, if there is compensation, that is
different."
Well, we may go on without this Bill. The
two railways may be asked to continue to
co-operate. If the policy followed since 1933
is continued, men .will be laid off without
compensation. My honourable friends who
know the situation between Montreal and
Quebec know very well that the men laid
off there because of the pooling arrangement
went out without compensation. Those men
are victims. The past is not taken into consideration in this Bill. We are thinking of
the future, and if the two railways decide to
make a considerable effort to reduce their
expenditure, quite a number of men will be
laid off. Under these circumstances I wonder
whether it is not provident for the Parliament of Canada to say to the railways, "Part
of the profits you will make out of cooperation with a view to reducing expenditure
should go to the men who will suffer-the
men who will be laid off as a result of that
co-operation." Altbough theoretically it may
appear, as my honourable friend has suggested, that for five years these men would
be in receipt of the full amount of their
salaries, my impression, based on my experience during our long inquiry into the situation
of the two railways, is that by reason of
attrition in the service a number of these
men will be recalled, and the cost will to a
certain extent be minimized.
I leave the matter in the hands of the
Senate. The question is whether we will
indicate some sort of compensation to the
men who will suffer under schemes of cooperation, or whether we will leave them to
their fate.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Before the vote is
taken, and merely for the purpose of keeping the record correct, I should like to say a
word. My honourable friend referred to Mr.
Coleman as making nu suggestion with reference to this proposed measure. My recollection is that be made one very definite suggestion. He first of all pointed out the difficulties of operating under this l'aw. He then
said he had made the sugg-stion that when

326

SENATE

the railways knew what the economies
in
connection with any co-operative measure
would amount to, a certain percentage should
be set aside, and that the men themselves
should determine how it should be distributed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is absolutely right: that statement was
made by Mr. Coleman. At the same time he
said. though, in reply to a question from me,
that he meant, not that an agreement between the men and the company would be
based on each co-operative move, but that
there would be a general agreement. I do
not see how there could be an understanding
as to the share that would fall to the employees in each particular case when a general agreement would be signed covering ail
cases.
The motion of Right Hon. Mr. Graham for
concurrence in the report of the committee
was agreed to.

PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 6, an Act to amend the Pension
Act.
He said:
Honourable senators, I should
like to make a few remarks with regard to
the proposed amendments to the Pension Act.
The Bill does not introduce any new prineiple into the Act; it simply amends three
features of the existing law.
The first amendment abolishes the Pension
Appeal Court, which I think lias been in
existence since 1934, and the "quorums," composed of members of the present Canadian
Pension Commission, and sets up appeal
boards, each consisting of three members of
the commission. These boards will hear evidence not only in Ottawa, but throughout
Canada. The applicants' right of appeal and
personal appearance will be preserved under
the present amendment.
The following table shows the decrease in

Court froum January 1, 1934, to January 1,

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
From
my honourable friend quoting?

901

what is

Hon. Mr. KING: From a memorandum
given to me by the department.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am looking at
page 77 of the report of the Department of
Pensions and National Health, where the
figures are very different from those.
Hon. Mr. KING:

For what year?

MAY 9, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: On that page
there is a table of decisions rendered on
appeals before the Pension Appeal Court
during the fiscal year ending March 31, 1938.
It shows that the number of those appeals,
under various headings, was 2,363. In addition,
decisions were rendered on applications in
205 cases.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think we must be at
cross purposes. I am merely quoting from a
table to show the decrease that there has
been in the number of applications between
the first of January, 1934, and the first of
January of this year. The memorandum
which I have before me shows that in 1934
commission counsel submitted 382 cases, and
there were 847 cases from applicants, a total
of 1,229 The next year commission counsel
and the Crown submitted 17 casesHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is the commission counsel the officer known as the reviewing officer? Would these be his cases?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They would be
appeals entered by him with respect to
decisions registered by quorums of the commission. But these figures do not pretend
to be all the cases that came before the
appeal court?
Hon. Mr. KING: I am speaking only of
the appeal court, not the quorums.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The report sets
out that 2,363 cases were adjudicated upon
by the appeal court in the year ending March
31, 1938.
Hon. Mr. KING: There would be that
number.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think there
must be a mistake of some kind, because my
honourable friend and I have not the same
figures at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How many
cases did my honourable friend say had been
submitted to the court- this year?
Hon. Mr. KING: Up to the first of
January, 1939, there were 201 cases.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: From what
time?
Hon. Mr. KING: January 1, 1938, to
January 1, 1939. That is for the last year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought
my honourable friend had already said there
were 384 cases in 1938.
Hon. Mr. KING: No; 371 cases in 1938;
and 201 cases from January 1, 1938, to
January 1, 1939.

327

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That would
be for 1938, then. I understood that the
number of cases in 1938 was 384.
Hon. Mr. KING: No; it was 371, between
January 1, 1937, and January 1, 1938.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is for
the year 1937. Then 200 for 1938?
Hon. Mr. KING: That is it. I think the
total given by my honourable friend would
be the number of cases dealt with by
the appeal court from January, 1934, to
January, 1938.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman explain what he means
by "cases." I notice the annual report for
19%8 of the Pension Department gives, at
page 77, the number of cases in 1938, not as
200, but as 2,363.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am advised that the
figures my right honourable friend is reading
represent cases pending before the court at
the end of each of those years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So there are
2,000 odd cases pending now?
Hon. Mr. KING: I suppose there would
be.
ýRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A good time
to abolish the courtl
Hon. Mr. KING: I am giving the number
of cases dealt with by the board from year
to year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Disposed of.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, disposed of.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Two thousand cases are now pending, and you propose
to abolish the commission!
Hon. Mr. KING: That is not my information. During the last five years the number
of appeals in which the Crown was successful
has been exceedingly small. For example,
out of 2,516 favourable decisions of the
quorums of the commission from December
31, 1934, to December 31, 1938, only 349 were
appealed by the Crown, and only 85 decisions
reversed. The Crown has not desired to lodge
many appeals.
Under this Bill it is proposed to abolish the
Pension Appeal Court and, as I have stated,
to set up appeal boards of the commission,
consisting of three members chosen from the
present commission.
The annual cost of the Pension Appeal Court
has been approximately $45,000. In five years,
as I have already stated, only 85 Crown
appeals have been allowed by the court, involving an estimated annual saving of pension

SENATE
liabilities of about $30,500. It is felt that
the proposed appeal boards will have better
opportunities of carrying on this work than
have been available to the present court and
quorums.
This Bill was very fully discussed in the
House, and no disagreement was
other
expressed with the proposal to abolish the
appeal court; in fact I think it was unanimously accepted as likely to improve administration of the Act.
The Bill also deals with the dead-line in
regard to the time for receiving applications.
From time to time Parliament has seen fit
to take such action. In 1933 a dead-line was
set for men who served in the army, but not
in the war zone. That dead-line will not be
disturbed. In 1936 a dead-line was set for
those who saw service in France and the other
theatres of war; it was advanced again to
1940; it is now proposed to extend that deadline to January 1, 1942. Some members of
the other House contended that there should
b no dead-line. Probably there will not be
any, because Parliament will from time to
time move that dead-line forward as the
cases warrant. This Bill does not provide for
the reopening of any applications heretofore
dýisposed of by the court, other than to the
extent set out in the Act, whereby, in special
circumstances, leave to review an application
may be granted,.
The Bill also deals with widows' pensions.
Under the present Act provision is made for
widows whose husbands were in receipt of a
pension of 80 per cent or more at the time
of death attributable to war injuries. Some
9,000 widows are in receipt of pensions of $60
a month. In 1930 legislation was passed giving the widow the benefit of the doubt in
regard to the cause of death of her husband.
Prior to that time proof had to be given that
the soldier had died from bis war injuries.
In many cases it was difficult to say whether
the soldier's death could be attributed directly
to such injuries or was caused by some disease
rontracted before enlistment. To ensure that
the benefit-of-the-doubt principle may be
extended as far as possible, this Bill proposes
to admit to the benefits of the Act all widows
whose husbands were in receipt of a pension
of 50 per cent or more at the time of death.
It is estimated that 350 widows will benefit by
this provision, but I am informed it will entail
no increase of our present expenditure, for
the widow simply takes the place of her
husband.
True, if we did not extend the
pension benefits to those 350 widows there
would be a corresponding amount saved. As
I say, this Bill was discussed at considerable
length in the other House. Members there
Hon. Mr. KING.

suggested that in the case of the death of a
soldier bis widow should receive at least a
year's pension, a principle adopted in the
War Veterans' Allowance Act, but the Government would not accept the suggestion.
I believe the Bill should commend itself to
this House. Mr. O'Connor, our Parliamentary
Counsel, informs me that he has no amendments to offer. As this is a rather lengthy
Bill and contains fairly extensive amendments to the Act, I would suggest that after
second reading it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce. There
representatives of the department may appear
and answer any questions which honourable
members interested in the legislation may
desire to ask.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators. I shall not discuss this
measure at the present time, but I should
like to ask the honourable gentleman whether
he can tell the House what, year by year,
during the past five or ten years, has been the
charge for pensions, and what it was in 1919
or 1920. My information is that it bas been
steadily increasing year by year, whereas in
Great Britain similar expenditure is less than
half what it was. In fact, I am advised that,
step by step, seeking to be popular, we are
following the example of the United States,
and we may still have a Pension Act in force
a hundred years hence. I should like to get
those figures, and also comparative figures for
Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. KING: I shall be glad to have
the figures prepared. I am informed that
during the last two or three sessions our
pension expenditure has not increased.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am told it
has.
Hon. Mr. KING: Allow me to explain. It
is true that Parliament did pass what was
known as the War Veterans' Allowance Act,
which provides for an allowance to men who
were in the front-line trenches and did not
acquire pensionable disability. The payments
under that Act are running into a considerable
sum of money. That principle has since been
accepted by New Zealand and Australia, and,
I think, also by the United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is just a
difference in terms.
Hon. Mr. KING: No; it is not a pension.
A pension is for disability.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a cash
payment to returned men. I am not saying
it is not right, but it differs from a pension
only in name. It is pretty much like the

MAY 9, 1939

329

MAY 9,1939
habit, which has become quite fashionable, of
calling a new tax "excise" instead of "duty."
For instance, a new tariff has recently been
imposed on vegetable oils. It is called an
excise tax, although no vegetable oil is made
in this country.
Hon. Mr. KING: I will get the figures for
my right honourable friend and submit them
later.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
members, as has been pointed out, this is
quite a lengthy Bill, but a good deal of it
consists
of
the necessary
consequential
amendments due to the abolition of the
Pension Appeal Board.
Hon. Mr. KING: Right.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Notwithstanding
the pacific tone of the honourable gentleman's
speech, there has been a good deal of discussion about this court, and the Bill may be
described as remedial legislation, that is, the
righting of a wrong.
The figures read by the honourable gentleman are entirely at variance with the figures
which I intend to use for the purpose of my
argument. I am about to refer to page 77
of the Annual Report of the Pension Department for the year ending March 31, 1938.
On that page will be found a report from
the President of the Pension Appeal Court,
giving the activities of the court for the past
year. He deals with four classifications of
cases: first, appeals from pension tribunal
decisions, to the number of 94; second, appeals
from the Canadian Pension Commission, to
the number of 113; third, appeals from
decisions of quorums of the commission, to
the number of 2,078; fourth, appeals by the
Crown from decisions of quorums of the commission, to the number of 78; making a total
of 2,363 cases considered by the Pension Appeal
Court for the year ended March 31, 1938.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is one year.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, one year.
Then to those classifications are added:
Decisions Rendered on Applications
That leave be granted to the Canadian
Pension Commission to entertain a
fresh application.. ............
187
For leave to renew before the court
applications for compassionate pension
or allowance under section 21 of the
Act.. ......................
18
The addition of those 205 cases to the cases I
have already mentioned gives a grand total
of 2,568.
Briefly, the record of the Pension Appeal
Court is this: "We have considered 2,363
appeals, and we have given a decision in favour

of the applicant in 19 cases." That is the
wrong which this Bill seeks to remedy.
Right Hon. Mr.
abolish the board!

MEIGHEN:

Therefore

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Undoubtedly the
agitation is to abolish the court. I repeat,
that is the wrong which this legislation seeks
to remedy.
It is interesting to examine the situation
further in order to ascertain whether there
is a wrong to be remedied. Again I give the
figures: 2,363 appeals heard and only 19 decisions rendered favourable to the applicant.
Those who think that this is an outrageous
state of affairs may be basing their opinion
upon their general knowledge and experience
of litigation in our law courts. My general
recollection is that in our civil courts the
decisions are about fifty-fifty; that is, in
about half the cases either the original plaintiff
or the original defendant is successful. The
proportion may be sixty to forty. That would
be my general impression as to the courts.
Consequently, when you are confronted with
this statement that of 2,363 applications only
19 were decided in favour of the applicant
you at once assume that there is a wrong
to be righted, and that the way to right it
is to get rid of this court.
But civil litigation is not quite the same
sort of thing. In civil litigation a man who
has a grievance or complaint of some sort
begins by consulting a lawyer. This lawyer
will say to him, "You have a good case," or
"You have no case," or "You have a doubtful case." In any event, the private litigant
has to pay his lawyer. He knows that if lie
proceeds with the case he will have te pay
his own lawyer, and that he may have to
pay the lawyer for the other side as well.
There is a close connection between that fact
and the fact that in our civil court the favourable decisions are divided as between plaintiff
and defendant on a basis of about fifty-fifty.
In the case of applications for pensions, the
Government begin by stationing throughout
the country pensions advocates who are paid
by the Government. An. applicant can apply
te them, and it costs him nothing. I fancy
that in the earlier days the advocates used to
say to a man: "You have no case. You had
better drop it." But they gave that up long
ago. Now they simply take the instructions
of the applicant and proceed to the end of the
road, because if they were to advise him that
he had no case it would not be long before the
local soldier organization would be informed
that this official was unsympathetic and not
doing bis job. So the pensions advocates paid
by the Government simply take the case-I
do not say there is no consultation-and make

an application to the Pension Commission.
If the applicant is turned down by the commission he may then appeal to a travelling
quorum of the board when it comes around.
That again costs him nothing. If his claim
for pension is rejected by the travelling quorum
he may then proceed to the Pension Appeal
Court without any expense to himself.
The Chief Pensions Advocate bas put
the statement on record somewhere or other
that in the case of 75 per cent of the applications which come into their hands the
pensions advocates knew from the very
beginning that there was no hope of success.
I did pension work free of charge in my
part of the country for nearly nineteen years,
and from an examination of the evidence I
could tell pretty well what were the chances
of succeeding. I was free to say to a man,
"You have no chance at all," and he would
accept my say-so. But applicants will not
accept the say-so of the paid advocate. So
it is possible to go to the highest court free
of charge, which accounts for the fact that
there are 2,3163 cases before that court. If
some Socialistic government were to bring
in legislation providing that in civil litigation
nobody would have to pay any costs, the
judiciary would have to be increased one
hundredfold, because everybody would be
at law.
I think I have established that there is
no wrong to be righted.
As to the 19 decisions in favour of the
applicant, I do not know that they prove
anything except that a favourable decision
was made.
Now, there are some curious things that
would seem to merit the attention of a committee. The Pension Commission here at
Ottawa operates through two commissioners
who are detailed to the job, and who sit here
and examine the applications that come to
them. If those two commissioners sitting
here in Ottawa grant an application, a pension
is thereupon issued, and there is no appeal.
These two officers of the board rate the individual and assess what he shall receive. But
if the decision of the Pension Commission is
adverse to the applicant, and be appeals to a
travelling quorum of the board, and that
travelling quorum grants him a pension, then
the Reviewing Officer may enter an appeal.
When the pension is granted by the two
pension commissioners ho cannot enter an
appeal, but when it is granted by a quorum
he can. That is something I am not able
to understand. In fact, I did not discover it
until the other day.
Another curious thing is this. If the
Crown appeals from a travelling quorum of
the board to the appeal court, the appeal
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

court must be unanimous in rejecting the
claim. In other words, if one member of
the appeal court says, "I am in favour of
granting the pension," his opinion overrides
that of the remainder of the court. I was
not aware of that until a few days ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If you win
the support of one member, that is all you
need.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, that is all
you need.
Now, the appeal court costs us $40,000 a
year. It may be said in its favour that it has
assured a uniformity of decisions. If honourable members will carry their minds back to
the old tribunals which were set up years ago,
and which travelled about the country, they
will remember that those tribunals inaugurated a perfect saturnalia of decisions that were
not in uniformity with anything but the views
of the individuals on the spot. I remember
that one of the things I insisted upon was a
uniformity of decisions frorn Vancouver to
Halifax. As I say, this appeal court brought
about a uniformity of decisions. In certain
cases the appeal court bas permitted new
evidence favourable to the applicant. But
the real value of this court, though it can
never appear in any statute, will probably
be understood by honourable gentlemen when
I outline the situation.
The quorums travel about the country in
twos. They occupy certain areas.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The quorums
of the commission?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The quorums of
the commission. They are all composed of
ex-soldiers. They are splendid fellows and
are welcomed wherever they go. They are
approached in their hotel rooms under social
conditions by individuals who want to get a
pension either for themselves or for someone
else. In the course of friendly conversation
the matter is raised, and the commissioners
are put on the spot. This court of appeal is
very useful to the commissioner. It enables
him to say: "My dear fellow, if I had the
deciding of this matter everything would be
all right, but this wretched appeal court has
the final say. Not only that. Its members
criticize my decisions and are quite nasty
about some of my rulings; so I am not able
to do this kindly thing for you, because these
people are sitting over me and watching me."
So, while the value of the appeal court cannot possibly be estimated in cash, in this
rather roundabout fashion it bas a real value
which is known to anybody who bas had
anything to do with it.

MAY 9, 1939

It must be borne in mind that the applications, before reaching the appeal court, have
already been rejected by the Pension Commission and the quorum of the Pension
Commission.
If this Bill passes, the appeal court disappears, and, so far as I can see, carries with
it the Reviewing Officer. I may be wrong
about that, but the provision for the appeal
from the quorum to the appeal court is not
repeated in the Bill, because a quorum no
longer exists. I think the Reviewing Officer,
representing the Crown, disappears, and he
is the only one in -the whole hierarchy who
represents the Crown.

The demand for the treatment of this court
in this fashion is rather curious. From
information that has reached nie, and from
my general knowledge, I think I can assert
that there is no demand for the destruction
of this court from thoughtful and responsible
ex-service men. This court was recommended,
I think, by the committee of 1930.

If she married

Hon. Mr. KING: That was an innovation
in 1933.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think that principle is very old; but its age does not
make any difference-it is there. The reason
behind that provision was that in ninety-nine
cases out of one hundred the man pensioned
in those classifications from 80 to 100 per
cent was mentally or physically incapable of
making a living for himself. He was not
able to take care of himself; he was not able
to escape common colds or any disease that
became prevalent; he was not able even to
get out of the way of a motor-car. So if an
80 to 100 per cent pensioner died, the presumption was that the cause of death was his
pensionable disability, and his widow got a
pension. The widow's pension was $60 a month
with respect to all classes of pensioners up
to the rank of lieutenant.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
that, more?

And above

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Above that the
widow's pension keeps pace with the pay of
ber late husband. Of course, the proportion
of cases above that rank would not be more
than two per cent. The complete officer personnel is about two and one-half per cent
of the total number of men in an army.
This Bill proposes to bring widows of men
with a 50 to 79 per cent pension into the
same class as widows of men with an 80 to
100 per cent pension. In other words, under
this Bill it will be assumed that the death
of a veteran with a 50 per cent pension is
due to his pensionable disability. I am told
that the actual evidence before the authorities
does not begin to support that assumption.
A number of honourable members who have
given some thought to this matter have assured
me they intend to vote against the Bill. I
thought it might be possible to reach a compromise, for we know that in the hard times
through which we have passed there were
many men and their wives living on $50 a
month.
Supporters of this Bill will find it pretty
difficult to defend the provision whereby, after
the death of a man receiving a pension of
50 per cent, which would be $50 a month for
himself and his wife, his widow would receive
$60 a month.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In other words,
the widow would get more for herself alone
than had been received by herself and her
husband during his lifetime.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And if a pensioner and his wife were getting $80 a month,
after his deathi the widow gets $60. That is
more than half of the payment for the two
persons. Under the War Veterans' Allowance
Act the pension is cut in half for the widow,
and there is no objection to that.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is a different thing
altogether.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Under this Bill,
the widow of a man who dies while receiving a 50 per cent pension, that is $50 a month,
would be paid $60 a month. The widow of
a 60 per cent pensioner would get the same
amount, as would the widow of a man who
while living drew a pension of $79 a month.
Actual records show that the proportion of
men who die from their pensionable disabilities is by no means as high in the class
receiving pensions of froîn 50 to 79 per
cent as in the 80 to 100 per cent class.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But in either
of those groups, if death occurs from pensionable disability, the widow becomes entitled?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
can you expect than that?

What more

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But my
honourable friend does not understand.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

I think I do.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Under this Bill
it would be presumed that the death of a
man in the 50 to 79 per cent class was due
to his pensionable disability. But upon the
death of a man who was drawing a pension
of less than 50 per cent, his widow, in order
to become entitled, would have to prove that
he died from a pensionable disability.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thoroughly
understand the matter as my honourable friend
is explaining it. I never understood it before.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
When we go
into committee I should like honourable members to consider a compromise.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Oh, yes. In
discussing this matter with some honourable
members I have suggested that the Bill be
amended to provide that when a veteran in
the 50 to 79 per cent class dies from pensionable disability his widow shall receive half
the amount that was being paid him during
the last three years of his life. That would
be less than $60 to the widow in every case.
And I think it might be well to insert a clause
requiring proof of need.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Why do you say the

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In any pension
legislation that I know of, the computation is
made with respect to the average income for
the last three years. The basis for computation in our superannuation systems is the
average salary for the last three years. Under
this measure, though, the term could be the
last ten years, if honourable members desired;
or no terni at all need be specified.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the last five years.

It is generally

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My understanding is that it is generally three years. As I
say, I think the Bill should require that need
should be established as well.
In my opinion it would be a great mistake
to abolish the Pension Appeal Court. I think
the honourable gentleman who sponsored the
Bill (Hon. Mr. King) should re-examine the
figures he quotedi, because they do not agree
with those contained in the department's
annual report, to which I referred.
I should like to see the Bill sent to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, where
evidence could be heard and the whole matter
argued out.
Hon. Mr. KING: I take it that in conmittee the honourable gentleman will move
amendments.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
I am quite
prepared to move an amendment striking
out the clause which would abolish the Pension
Appeal Court. I also would invite the conmittee to consider the other points I have
raised.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Surely the
sponsor of the Bill (Hon. Mr. King) does not
intend us to understand that it will not increase our pension expenditures.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am informed that a
saving will be made through abolition of the
appeal court. Of course, where a pensioner
has been getting $50 and his widow is given
$60, there will be an increase.

333

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have entirely misunderstood the Bill if it would not
result in a gigantic increase.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am informed not. As
I have said, there would be an increase in those
cases where widows are paid more than their
late husbands received. But where no pension
is granted to the widow of a pensioner, there
will be a saving.
I think my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) will have difficulty
in justifying the payment of $60 to the widow
of a pensioner of 80 per cent disability and
a smaller sun to the widow of a pensioner of
50 per cent disability.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why so? It
would be no more difficult to justify than
paying one soldier for an 80 per cent disability and another for a 20 per cent disability.
Hon. Mr. KING:

No, no.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Is our
liability to the widow of a soldier who had
a 10 per cent disability the *same as our liability to a widow whose husband's disability
was 100 per cent?
Hon. Mr. KING: Certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Then we
have the sane liability to the widow of a
soldier who had no disability.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. We have not
recognized that principle, but we may do so
some day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I fear that if
my honourable friend gets in charge, we shall.
I do not know where we are going to end,
and I see very little hope of checking expenditures. We are simply drifting down the easy
road. There is no business-like grasp of our
expenditure problem at all; not the slightest.
I do not know how we expect ever to take
care of unemployment, to help bring about
conditions under which more people can get
work.
The case presented by my honourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
made this subject clear to me for the first
time in a long period. I presume the whole
thing will go through. It always does.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend is not challenging the second
reading?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For quite a
while I have not seen much use in challenging
anything.

Encourage the Co-operative Marketing of
Wheat.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is the honourable gentleman not going to explain the Bill?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Of course.

I have some objection

to it.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take up very much
time in explaining this Bill or in talking
about it, because it simply embodies only one

or two principles, besides providing a method
for the more or less orderly marketing of
wheat, which perhaps concerns Western Canada more than any other part of the country.
When the Bill was introduced the right
honourable leader on the other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) said there might be some
question of our constitutional power to pass
such a measure. I questioned the law officers
of the Crown about this aspect, and their
reply was the same as when I asked some time
ago for their opinion on the Grain Futures
Bill, which opinion is on Hansard. I also
discussed the matter with our Parliamentary
He says that, as he views the
Counsel.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

British North America Act, this measure
comes within the jurisdiction of Parliament,
but that if a finding were given in accordance
with the decision handed down on the Natural
Products Marketing Act, which was passed by
a former Government, the measure would
probably be held ultra vires. I cannot sec
how a deliberative assembly like this could
decide on the constitutionality of such a Bill,
because in order to do so it would be necessary
to make up our minds on the basis of arguments which would not be very clear to a great
many of us. However, I doubt if anybody
is going to question whether or not this Bill
is constitutional. That may not be a very
good position from a legal point of view, but
from Western Canada's present point of view
it is good common sense. We have a lot of
legislation affecting the marketing and handling of wheat that is vital to Western Canada,
and particularly to the three Prairie Provinces.
If it were all abolished we should certainly be
in a very bad way.
The purpose of this Bill is to give Western
Canada farmers, elevator companies and other
organizations that are interested in the marketing of wheat a guarantee to some extent
against loss. There is no doubt that the
marketing of the products of any producer is
the most important feature of his business.
It is a comparatively easy thing for factories
to turn out goods; it is when they cannot sell
them promptly that they get into difficulties.
The selling of farm produce presents the
greatest problems of all. The producers are
for the most part operating on a small scale,
and because of the circumstances in which
they carry on their business they are incapable
of doing their own marketing. I have no
doubt that the man engaged in mixed farming
can best market his products right on his own
farm. Most of the successful producers who
are engaged in mixed farming on a small scale
in Ontario have done their own marketing at
home.
But wheat is an entirely different thing.
A Western Canada farmer who lives some
distance from a railway may not have enough
wheat to fill a car, and if there is no Government wheat board or pool or other organization to which he can deliver his wheat he is
under the necessity of selling at the street
price. And I need not tell anybody who
knows anything about selling wheat what the
street price means. To put it briefly, the
farmer in that position gets three or four
cents a bushel less. It was that sort of thing
which was responsible for the organization of
the -wheat pool in Western Canada. I listened
to Mr. Aaron Shapiro at the first meeting he
held out there. One had only to look at the

MAY 9, 1939
people in his audience to see that he could
do just about as he liked with the business.
They had suffered for a long time by being
trimmed in one way and another on the
products that they had to sell. So that
organization looked good to them. It worked
well for a time. As long as there was a rising
market there was no trouble about pool
marketing. But the difficulty in this as in
every other business is that there must be a
capable manager at the head of it. I am not
placing blame on any particular person or
group of persons for the failure of the pool.
The price of wheat continued to rise for a
few years after the pool was started, and they
thought, just as we are all prone to think,
there never would be a poor day, and the price
would continue to go up. When the price
began to go« down, I remember a prominent
man connected with the pool saying that he
was sitting on his bag of wheat. Well, he
would have to sit on it a long time before he
would have hatched out anything like the
price he would have got had he sold it right
then. The price went down until the pool
found itself about $24,000,000 in debt.
There never has been any doubt in my mind
that Mr. Bennett did a good thing when he
got Mr. McFarland to take charge of the
wheat business.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: He was skilled in
a business that he had long practised. He
had made handsome profits for himself and
his associates in the handling of wheat in
his elevators throughout Western Canada.
As a matter of fact, it would have been difficult to find anybody better equipped for the
job. I think the then Prime Minister recognized that what was most needed was a man
who understood the selling of wheat and
could handle the situation.
This year the wheat is being marketed by
the Grain Board. There are suggestions that
there may be a loss running up to more than
$40,000,000. If that is the case, then at the
end of this crop year we shall find ourselves
in about the same position that those in the
pool found themselves in, for that is too
heavy a loss to bear, year after year, in
marketing wheat in that fashion.
As a result, the wheat producers, the
elevator owners and others interested in this
business in Western Canada will have to
organize in order to handle their own business.
I think it will be much better if they organize
small pools. As a matter of fact, the wheat
pool now is just an elevator company. It
owns about 1,647 elevators in Western Canada. It is probably at the present time the

largest owner of elevators in the West. But
there are large numbers of other companies
who have built elevators to handle grain.
The purpose of this Bill is to enable elevator companies and farmers in groups to
organize what is virtually a marketing association. It is called a co-operative association,
but we all know that most of the co-operative
associations we have in Canada-there are
hundreds of them in operation at the present
time; in fact the list is surprisingly long-I
say most of those co-operative associations
are joint stock companies in which the stockholders hold small shares of stock. Nearly
all our cheese factories in Ontario are called
co-operative cheese factories, but they are
joint stock companies in which the farmer
takes a little stock, for which probably he
pays $10 down and the balance out of the
cheques he receives for his milk delivered to
the factory. Those stockholders have a meeting every year to engage their cheese manufacturer, who is paid a certain percentage on
the cheese he manufactures. A good many
creameries are also run along similar lines.
Under this Bill the Government will protect
these wheat organizations against loss, provided the payments made are based on a

60-cent price

at Fort William for No. 1

Northern wheat., with variations for other
grades, less storage charges and operating
costs. It means that the farmer on delivery
of his wheat would get an advance payment
based on that 60 cents. This is highly important
to farmers in Western Canada, since unfortunately many of them have only one cropwheat. They have store bills and other payments to make, and they must have money.
Private elevator companies have been buying
wheat over a long period of years and advancing small sums of money, and larger sums,
of course, when the price is higher. This Bill
will enable the wheat producer in the pool
to get an initial payment on the basis of 60
cents, and participation certificates which will
entitle him to all his wheat brings, less the
expenses of handling and shipping.
I know the farmers will be slow in forming
the organizations I have described. Honourable members will observe that the Bill does
not come into force until a date to be fixed
by proclamation, the reason being that as long
as the Grain Board is operating, as at present,
it would oerhaps be useless to put this
measure into effect. But we have to take the
long view of the situation, and must do
everything we can to put the wheat growers
in Western Canada in a position to carry on
their business in their own fashion, and so
get a reasonable price for their wheat instead
of having to sacrifice it at the street price.

336

SENATE

The figure of 60 cents has been fixed as the
price, because during the last forty or fifty
years wheat lias only once dropped lower than
60 cents at Fort William. No co-operative
association could pay what we hope will be
the full value of the wheat, because if it did
it would find itself in just the same position
as the pool when wheat took a tumble.
As I have said before in this House, Western
Canada will continue to grow wheat. Truc
it is developing the dairy industry and cattle
production, but a great deal of the prairie
is well adapted to grow wheat except when
there is a lack of rain. Unfortunately we
cannot do anything to remedy that handicap. We do know, however, that when it did
rain the farmers in those districts grew wheat
in abundance.
This Bill will lay the foundation for ceoperation between the wheat producers and
the marketing agencies-for that, after all, is
what the elevator companies are-in order
that they may carry on the marketing of
wheat as effectively as they can in Western
Canada.
Co-operation at times makes grcat strides
in our country, but very often when prices
rise co-operation goes to pieces. But we cannot change human nature. It has been sugges.ted that this Bill should be made conpulsory. I disagree with that view entirely.
It must be on a voluntary basis. I do not
think there should be any compulsion in
respect to the niarketing of wheat, though the
principle may very well be applied to the
distribution, in cities of milk and other
perislable produets.
It will be remembered by many honourable
senators that when Mr. Bennett's Government
introduced a bill to establish a wheat board
it contained a compulsory clause, but this
was afterwards deleted because it was felt
h would arouse very strong opposition among
our wheat producers. Naturally, they would
desire to have a free hand in selling their
wheat, though, as a matter of fact, under the
wheat board appointed by that Government
they should be able to get full value for their
product.
I am afraid. however, that this year the
producers are going to get substantially more.
I am bound to say I do net think anyone
either in Eastern or in Western Canada
begrudges what it will cost this year te pay
80 cents a bushel for wheat. I believe the
majority of Canadians feel that the people of
the West have suffered as only people can
suffer who live where no rain falls and the soil
is swept away in dust storms. Many honourable members have been in the West and have
seen just what can happen to somce of the
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

farms in the d.rought districts. Such a condition is not on.ly ruinons to the people; it
breaks their hearts. So if the guaranteed price
for wheat this year helps to some extent to
put the Western farmer on his feet, I believe
the whole Dominion will be glad, in spite
of the fact that it does cost so much money.
I commend this Bill to the support of honourable members, for it will enable our wheat
growers and the selling agencies in Western
Canada to market their product in a reasonable and effective fashion.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Section 2 defines
"elevator company."
Do I understand that
this covers co-operative as well as private
elevator companies?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Bill covers
any elevator company, private or co-operative.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Suppose I am the owner
oe one elevator at Reston, Manitoba. Do I
come under this Bill?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You can by organizing with a group of wheat growers and with
other elevators, if you wish.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Supposing I own 120
elevators, and am the Reliance Grain Company. do I come under this Bill?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I object to.
If you own 120 elevators you come under
this Bill; if yen own only 119 you do not.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If your answers to me
are correct, nly statement is correct. "Elevator
company" is defined as a company that owns
120 elevators.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No; "one hundred or
more."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Take 99 elevators, then.
If my company owns 99 elevators, I do net
core under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yeu would have to builà
another elevrator.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have protests from a
good many elevator companies owning five,
six, ten or twelve elevators scattered over
that country. A man may own an elevator
in this town, and another man an elevator
in another town, and they ship their grain to
one terminal elevator.
This Bill does not
cover them at all. and there are twenty
such companies engaged in the grain trade
in Western Canada. I want the definition
changed so as to include all elevator companies.

MAY 9, 1939
My honourable friend dealt at length with
the encouragement of co-operatives. If all
you want to do is to encourage the cooperatives, you should strike out the whole
of paragraph (d) of section 2, and the words
"or one or more elevator companies" and so
on, from paragraph (i). In other words, all
elevator companies should be included.
I do not know whether honourable members
understand what this Bill is really doing.
Anybody who has farmed in Western Canada
knows that if a man has two or three carloads of wheat in the fall, he takes it to the
elevator company, where it is graded. It
may be that he needs some money to enable
him to carry on his business. In that case
he does not want to sell the grain, but wants
to get an advance. In former years the
elevator company went to the bank and
borrowed the money and made the advance.
The difficulty came when the grain was sold at
less than 60 cents. Under this Bill the Government make up the difference. Therefore
it is of advantage to any elevator company
to come under it, for then, provided the
advance does not exceed 60 cents No. 1, Fort
William, the company is perfectly safe.
My honourable friend from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall) says that this is to help the
co-operatives. On the other hand, it discourages all the little fellows, for only the
man with a hundred elevators can carry on.
I have received protests against this Bill,
but I am not going to read them. Protests
were sent also to the Prime Minister and a
number of others. All I will say about those
which were sent to the Prime Minister is
that they were acknowledged. If this Bill
goes through, the smaller elevator companies
will find it difficult to operate in competition
with the larger elevator companies. I do not
know what can be the object of the provision
with respect to the one hundred elevators or
more in paragraph (d), unless it is to kill off
the little fellows, which it certainly will do.
I presume the Bill is going to committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does it provide for compensation or pension?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it does not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That will
come before the next election.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Paragraph (d) of section
2 defines an elevator company. It says:
"elevator company" means an incorporated
company or association of incorporated companies which operates or controls one hundred
or more country elevators in the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta or British
Columbia.

337

Paragraph (i) defines a selling agency. It
says:
"selling agency" means a person authorized by
one or more co-operative associationsI am agreeable to that.
-or one or more elevator companies or one
or more co-operative associations and elevator
companies to market wheat under one or more
co-operative plans.
Under section 3 a selling agency can be
absolutely safe in advancing 60 cents, Fort
William, because if it gets less than that
figure on the sale, the Government make
up the difference.
All I want is to have the Bill go to committee, so that it can be amended. There
is no reason why it should not be amended.
All the grain is graded at Fort William or
Vancouver, under Government supervision.
There are at present in Winnipeg twenty
elevators, which are licensed by the department, and I know there are dozens of others
scattered all over Manitoba. For instance,
there is the Forsythe Elevator Company near
High Bluff. It will be known to my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
Andy Forsythe has five or six elevators. Tom
Lytle bas one elevator. These people all
combine at one terminal, and the terminal
company tells me it represents a number of
scattered all over the
elevator people
Western Provinces who have each but a
single elevator. These people, I am told, will
be put out of business. I presume the Bill
is going to committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my honourable friend read the debate in the other
House? Has this point been presented to the
Minister?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know. I got
this letter on the 26th of April. Afterwards
I read the Bill over, and in my opinion the
statement in the letter is correct. The Prime
Minister acknowledged the letter on the 22nd
of April.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely there are
several Western members in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. But I come from
the city of Winnipeg, where the elevator
companies are located, and I have reason to
believe that the little fellow who owns two
or three small elevators scattered over the
province would not know about this Bill at all.
It was called to my attention by a terminal
elevator.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman for a moment?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: It would seem to
me that this does not mean that where there
is a group of small elevators one fellow
might be shut out. This co-operative plan
will be organized only when there are one
hundred elevators. The Bill says:
"elevator company" means an incorporated
company or association of incorporated companies which operates or controls one hundred
or more elevators.
It would be scarcely worth while to organize
an association unless there were one hundred
elevators.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
does not understand my point. It has to do
with the advancing of money by the company
to an amount in excess of what it could get
from the bank. No one would dare to advance
60 cents to-day, because the market price the
other day was 62 cents,.and it might go down.
The highest proportion ever advanced in the
old days was about 75 per cent of the Fort
William price. If the price at Fort William
were $1, the advance to the farmer would be
75 cents. During the last twenty years the
advance has been less than that, because of
the greater fluctuation in the market and the
lack of protection.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
ie one hundred elevators.

But there must

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I do not
vant, because the fellow with a hundred eleîators can squeeze the little fellow. That is
:lear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: This is not a very
iroper way of discussing these things.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend is
'discussing." I am nnt. I am trying to debate
the issue. My honourable friend had a chance
of speaking, and I was prevented from asking
him a question. Otherwise I would have
raised this point, and my honourable friend
could have answered it.
However, I shall be satisfied if the Bill
goes to committee, provided that officials of
the department are brought there who will
give me an assurance that the single-elevator
man is protected.

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: There is in southcrn Alberta a milling company which has
probably six or eight elevators on Canadian
Pacifie Railway lines. Does the honourable
gentleman maintain that that company would
not come under this Bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
under it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

No, it would not come

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if it would not come
under the definition of a selling agency?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Under paragraph
(i) a selling agency-means
a person authorized by one or more
co-operative associations or one or more elevator
companies or one or more co-operative associations and elevator companies to market wheat
under one or more co-operative plans.
Elevator companies are defined in paragraph
(d).
Therefore the definition of an elevator
company will apply to the selling agency, and
the elevator companies are the only ones who
can get'the advance from the Government.
All I want is a promise that the Bill will
go to committee, and if the Department of
Agriculture can show me that I am wrong in
my understanding, well and good. If not, I
suggest that we should amend the Bill so that
the single-elevator fellows will have an equal
opportunity with the hundred-elevator fellows.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, apart from the constitutional
feature, I am not quite clear what the program
is. This is a Bill to assist and encourage the
co-operative marketing of wheat. There is
ils
a Bill to assist and encourage the cooperative marketing of agricultural products.
If I understood correctly what the sponsor
of the Bill said, he intimated that there was
another Bill fixing a price for wheat. Was I
wrong in that?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I just mentioned
Mr. Euler's Bill, which is now in the Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
What does
it do? If it fixes a price for wheat, what is
to bu the effect of it on the consideration of
this Bill, which clearly contemplates that the
farmer will get what the wxheat brings, subject only to tho minimum of 60 cents?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The other Bill is
not bere yet, but it has been discussed in the
Commons. I have listened to some of the
discussion there. It fixes the price of wheat
at 70 cents for the next wheat year. Under
tiis Bill companies will be organized, provided the price of wheat goes up. If it does
not, it will probably not be worth their while
to organize.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
understand yet. Why would anybody advance
60 cents under this Bill? What is the object of
advancing 60 cents to the farmer and telling
bim he will be sure to get that anyway, if
there is another Bill which says he is really
going to

get 70 cents?

MAY 9, 1939
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think I can clear up
that point. Under this Bill there is an advance of 60 cents. If the wheat brings 80
cents when it is sold on the world's market,
the farmer will get the benefit. Under the
other Bill there is a straight payment of 70
cents.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, that
cannot be pinned on me. That was done
before I came into this House.

In other
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
words, the Government intend to buy wheat
at 70 cents, and if the price goes higher the
difference will go to the treasury?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I will
take responsibility for anything I do, but not
for something that was done when I was a
private citizen of Canada.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It will go to the pool.
This Bill will not come into operation at
all if the other Bill goes into effect.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that I
know far less than my right honourable friend
about the operations of this Bill.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, now I
see. Things are clearing. We may be wasting our time and brains on this Bill-and I
fancy we are-because a Bill which gives 70
cents will pass the other House much more
easily than one which gives only 60 cents. I
think my honourable friend from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall) has been put in charge of a
very worthless expedition. What is the sense
of our considering this Bill if the passage of
another Bill which is coming from the same
I was

troubled. I could not figure it out. When
this Bill came down and 60 cents was mentioned, we heaid a lot of thunder and saw
a lot of lightning in the western sky. I knew
it would have its effect, because I know the
Government.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will never
bc put into operation at all.

but I have stood my ground. I never knew this
Government to stand their ground on anything. Just as soon as they sec a few more
votes are to be got with payments out of
the treasury, they make the payments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
statement to make.

That is an easy

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And it is an
easy course to follow. But I know where it is
leading. We are going to have a bill which
provides for 70-cent wheat; so I see no use in
considering this one any further.
I think-my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend may correct me if I
am wrong-that the principle of fixing a price
for wheat was adopted by himself, or his
Government. And the price was then fixed
at 87½ cents. Now we are down to 70 cents.
However, that is by the way.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my right
honourable friend should take responsibility
also for what was done a few months before
he came in.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I listened to the
explanation given by my honourable friend
from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall), and by using
the little common sense which I possess I was
able to understand him. I looked at the
explanatory note to see if it contained anything in addition to what was pointed out by
my honourable friend. It reads this way:
The purpose of this Bill is primarily to assure
that selling agencies marketing wheat on the
co-operative plan for co-operative associations
or elevator companies and who make an initial
payment contingent upon the sale price for
the various grades of wheat at Fort William
shall, under certain conditions, suffer no loss.
The Bill proposes that co-operative associations
or elevator companies who desire to avail themselves of the provisions of the Act shall create
a selling agency and enter into an agreement
with the Government. This agreement is to
provide, amongst other things, that if the
average sale price for No. 1 Northern, basis in
store Fort William, is less than sixty cents per
bushel, with variations for other grades, and
if the initial payment, together with storage
charges and operating costs, does not exceed
sixty cents, but does exceed such average sale
price, the Government will pay to the selling
agency the difference between the average sale
price and the total expenditures on account of
initial payment, storage charges and operating
costs.
Authority is vested in the Minister, with the
approval of the Governor in Council, to make
regulations respecting the provisions that shall
be included in any such agreement and in particular with regard to the variations in the
initial payments necessitated by the various
grades of wheat and the establishment of a
reserve fund.
If I am not mistaken, this means that if
there is a loss because of the advance of
60 cents a bushel, the Government will make
good the loss. If the price goes above 60
cents, there will be no loss to the Government.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask the honourable
gentleman from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall)
how many co-operative societies he has known

340

SENATE

of in Western Canada that have been successful. While he was speaking I was thinking
back over the years and I was unable to recall
a single one of these which proved a success.
Co-operation is all right, but exploitation
is wrong. The farmer las been exploited: lie
bas been given very little for bis product.
As the honourable member who is piloting this
Bill (Hon. Mr. Marshall) knows, the old
cattle buyer who used to come onto the farm
and make lis purchases was driven out of
business. Now the farmer takes bis cattle on
a truck into a packer's yard and lets the
packer set the price. When the farmer used
to bring in a load of grain and sell it at the
elevator, lie got bis moncy, and then went
to settle bis account with the storekeeper. I
can remember seeing. written in big letters
at the Winnipeg stockyards, "The Organized
Farmer in, Business." Well, there was a cooperative, with a pool, but it finally went to
pieces. The honourable gentleman can also
remember that. Just to see what the live
stock end of the pool was doing I put in
one lot of cattle, and I received about two
cents a pound less than I could have made
out of them in the yards. And later I got 30
cents a head as a dividend fron the pool.
Creameries are another co-operative enterprise into which the farmers have gone and
which have proved unsuccessful. The honourable gentleman knows about the Saskatchewan
creameries.
As to this Bill, my suggestion is that the
farmer be given a chance to do something
on the land. and that for this one year lie be
helped out by a payment of 80 cents a bushel
for his wheat. One year we gave him 87J
cents, and if that wheat had been held instead
of having been sold at a fire sale he would
have got $1.30 or $1.40. Having lived in the
West for nearly half a century, and knowing
the conditions that the farmer faces, I urge
in an advisory way that lie be given 80 cents
a bushel this year, to help him out. Do net
bother witli co-operatives. Let him bring in
the wheat, give him 80 cents, and lie will pay
bis bills to the merchant.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Give him a dollar.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: I think that is the
only way to help out the wheat grower. I am
net in the wheat business, and I never sold
a bushel of grain to an elevator. I have grown
20.000 bushels of oats in one year and successfully marketed them on four feet. I do net
want to be exploited by co-operatives and
elevators. Wbat happened at Fort William?
Some honourable members have read the
story-have read Price Waterhouse's report on
the exploitation of the grain grower.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS.

I repeat that the way to help the farmer is
to guarantee him 80 cents a bushel for his
wheat this year. Let him bring the wheat into
the market himself and sell it at the elevator,
and take bis money.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I should like to say a word in reply to
the remarks of my honourable friend from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig).
As I read this Bill, it does not shut out the
small elevator companies. But you cannot
afford to engage a selling agency for one elevator, or a group of two, three or four elevators. A hundred elevators would net have
more than enough grain to make it worth
while to pay a selling agency to handle it,
and this Bill makes it necessary to have one
hundred elevators in any co-operative organization that is formed. It defines "elevator
company" as an incorporated company or
association of incorporated companies. Therefore if the elevators south of Lethbridge wish
to take advantage of this Bill they will join
with another group of elevators, but unless
there are 100 elevators in the scheme they
do net form a co-operative plan under this
Bill. The reason is that if you had many
peddling little things all over the prairies you
would multiply the cost of doing business.
As to whether we are wasting our time on
this Bill, as has been suggested, I said, in the
few imperfect remarks I made on the motion
for second reading, that the Bill was intended
for the future, that it was net likely it would
be proclaimed immediately. but that we had
to develop some system by which we could
sell our grain te the best advantage. As the
honourable member for Winnipeg SouthCentre has pointed out, if the farmer is
guaranteed an advance price of 60 cents Fort
William for No. 1 Northern, lie will take bis
wheat into the pool elevators, where he will receive enough money to go on with, and later
whatever balance is coming to him lie will get.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. DUNCAN MoL. MARSHALL moved
the second reading of Bill 89, an Act to Assist
and Encourage Co-operative Marketing of
Agricultural Products.
He said: Honourable senators, I shall be
briefer still with regard to this measure, because it is along the lines of the preceding
bill except that it deals with all other agricultural products.

inclination not to listen too much to anything
dealing with agriculture.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, not
at all.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Wait until you
get to committee.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: There is a group
of farmers near Saskatoon who this year
raised more registered alfalfa seed than was
grown elsewhere in Canada. They sold early,
and the price doubled. Of course, that is not
always the case. They have already expressed
a desire to organize under this Bill se they
may have a chance to get what is coming to
thein for their crop.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope the
honourable senator did not get the impression
that anybody on either side of the House was
impatient because this Bill deals with agriculture. That is not the state of mind of the
Senate at all.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

might not get through by six.

PENSION BILL
CORRECTION OF STATEMENT

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
I rise te a question of privilege. I should
like to correct a statement I made yesterday

which was somewhat misleading. I was dealing with a statement sent to me by the department, setting forth the decrease in the number of applications before the Pension Commissioners from the year 1934 te the year
1939. What the statement really meant was
this: on January 1, 1934, there were 1,229
cases ready and prepared for appeal before
the board; on January 1, 1935, there were
519 cases; on January 1, 1936, there were 789;
on January 1, 1937, there were 1,141; on January 1, 1938, there were 371, and this year, on
January 1, 1939, there were 201. That is what
I was trying to state, but I made a mistake
and mixed it up.

PRIVATE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM presented, and moved concurrence in, the report
of the Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours, on Bill Zi, an Act
to incorporate Prescott and Ogdensburg
Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable senators, there have
been several amendments made te this Bill.
They were all prepared by our own Law
Clerk in company with the gentleman in
charge of the Bill. They are net very essential, and the committee passed them last
night on an understanding which the promoters have agreed to. In some of the bridge
bills of this character no deposit has been
exacted. The committee had the gentleman
in charge of the Bill agree that a deposit
clause should be inserted in the Bill. As
time was so short, it was agreed that this
clause should be inserted in the Commons,
although this is a Senate Bill.
The motion was agreed te.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall
this Bill be read a third time, as amended?

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT ACT
DISCUSSION POSTPONED

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Hughes:

342

SENATE

Inasmuch as we are not likely to have the
annual report of the administration of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act for the
last fiscal year in time to discuss it this session,
and inasmuch as we have already received some
figures in regard to the administration of said
Act for the year 1938-39, the consideration of
which would probably give the Government and
Parliament information which they should have
at as early a date as possible, I therefore give
notice that I shall on Wednesday next call
the attention of the Senate to the interim
figures which were furnished, to their implications, and to some other features of the
administration of said Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
my honourable friend to postpone discussion
uîntil to-morrow. There is important business
to be done, which will take all our time this
afternoon. I think my honourable friend will
consent to postponement till to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Provided I do not
lose my place on the Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
as it is.

It will remain

The notice stands.
STATE OF CANADA'S DEFENCE
DISCUSSION OONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
4, the adjourned debate on the question
proposed by Hon. Mr. Griesbach, calling the
attention of the Senate to the state of the
defence of Canada.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, a few days ago we listened with a
great deal of interest to an excellent speech
delivered by the honourable senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach). You will
remember that the honourable senator called
our attention to the state of the defences of
Canada. I do not think it is necessary for
me to say that this is perhaps the greatest
question which the people of Canada, and
particularly the Parliament of Canada, have
to deal with at the moment. They have to
decide what they will do with regard to the
defences of Canada and the procuring of
necessary equipment not only to protect our
own coast line, but to enable us to do our
duty by the Empire.
There are different opinions in the Dominion on this question. I can understand why
people are wondering what exactly we should
do and how far we should go, and why there
is consequently, both in the newspapers and in
public bodies, much controversy with respect
to this grave matter. I feel quite sure the
people of this country want to do their duty
not only by Canada, but by the British Empire,
and, as there are in that connection certain
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

questions which we must consider, I for one
can understand why, as I said a moment ago,
there are differences of opinion.
The honourable senator from Edmonton is
perhaps one of the few people in this Parliament who can speak authoritatively on the
military side of the question; but I regret
very much to find that in his excellent presentation the honourable gentleman introduced a partisan note, and confined himself
mostly to what had happened during the
last three or four years. I say, honourable
members, this is too large a question for
partisanship. Perhaps my honourable friend
is worried about the defences of Canada, and
I can understand that, but it is unfortunate
that he should sound a jarring note which
would be conveyed to our enemies in Europe.
It seems to me that in this Parliament at
least we should endeavour to keep as far
away as possible from anything that would
give comfort to the enemy.
My honourable friend said in his speech
that the present Government lacked courage.
He also said it lacked business ability. He
went even further: he said that evidently
the policy of the Government was a "go-slow"
policy. Again I can sympathize with my
honourable friend, because, perhaps, like myself. he sometimes chafes under the bit and
feels that governments do not move as fast
as they should. Nevertheless, as I said a
moment ago, it seems to me that on this question, which is one of primary importance, we
should endeavour to stifle our partisan feelings. I hope my honourable friend will not
be offended if I say that when he was delivering his speech I made a memorandum that
"another Daniel had come to judgment." I
wondered why, in his splendid speech, which
should have been of so much help to the
Government and the Minister of Defence, he
had not omitted the partisan note. He went
on to say that the Minister, who had spoken
in another place in this building a few days
previously, had made a speech of "terrifie
wordage." much of which might be discarded
as "padding." I presume he meant the speech
was lengthy and contained certain matters
to which he objected.
When I say that in matters of this kind we
should keep as far away as possible from
partisan politics, I must admit that there is
no greater partisan in this country than I am.
On certain questions I am willing to stand
up and fight for my party. But in a matter
of such serious consequence as the national
defence of Canada we should all try to subdue our partisan feelings and work together
in the best interests of the country.

MAY 10, 1939
My honourable friend referred to what had
been done in the last three years. After he
had concluded his excellent speech I went to
the Library and waded through the Senate
Hansard for a number of years, and up to
1935 I could find net a word from my honourable friend with regard to our defences. He
was like a sheep bef ore her shearers; he was
dumb, and he opened nat his mouth.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is good
Presbyterian doctrine.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, that is good Presbyterian doctrine, as my right honourable friend
says. I am only sorry that he went back on
us in 1924.
My honourable friend from Edmonton
criticized the Department of National Defence
because of what it had not done, and perhaps
I may be allowed to quote some figures to
show what actual expenditures have been
made. I will try to keep clear of political
considerations in my remarks, and therefore I
will go back a little farther than the period
from 1930 ta 1935. I am told that open confession is good for the soul. In the years
immediately following the war I was one of
the strongest objectors, both in Parliament
and elsewhere, to the spending of large
amounts on our militia and navy. But that,
honourable members, was in 1919 and 1920.
The war had cost us two billions of dollars,
60,000 of the flower of our youth had been
left on Flanders fields, and 200.000 crippled
and wounded soldiers had been brought back
to this country, for us to care for them as best
we could-and our present annual bill for
In those
looking after them is $50,000,000.
days I felt that we had fought a war te end all
wars. For that reason I said then-and I am
not ashamed of it now, because I thought I
was right-that there was no need to spend
much money in Canada for military or naval
purposes.
But to-day I have a different
opinion. In fact, I had a different opinion as
far back as two years ago. Perhaps honourable members will recall that in 1937 I urged
in this Chamber that more money should be
spent for the protection of Canada.
As I said a few moments ago, I want to give
some figures to show what expenditures have
been made on our army, our navy and our air
forces in recent years. Back in 1926 our
outlay on those three arms of defence was
only $12,900,000. In 1927 that was increased
to $15,800,000. I think everyone will agree
that was only enough to keep up a mere
skeleton organization in the various branches.
We could not very well have spent much less,
if we were going te have any kind of defence
system at all. For the next three years the

343

expenditures were: 1928, $18,800.000; 1929,
$20,600,000; 1930. $22,100,000. I call honourable members' attention to the fact that in the
five-year period from 1926 to 1930 there was a
gradual increase in our annual budget for
defence. The Defence Ministers of those days,
my friends Macdonald and Ralston, both of
whom, I think I can say, had the respect not
only of Parliament, but of the country,
realized the necessity of strengthening our
protective forces.
Now, if my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) will allow me te
follow in his footsteps and introduce a partisan note, I will come to the year 1931. That
appropriation te
year we reduced our
$18,900,000. In 1932-33 we spent only $15,000,000; in 1933-34, only $13,000,000; in
1934-35, $13,300,000, and in 1935-36, $17,300,000.
I am presenting those figures to the House
because my honourable friend criticized the
Government and the Department of National
Defence with regard te what they had done.
I do not say he condemned them. After
hearing him, I thought it might be well to
compare those figures with the expenditures
in the period from 1926 to 1930. Then there
was no sign of any trouble in this world and
we were hoping the nations were going to
beat their swords into ploughshares and their
spears into pruning hooks. In the early thirties, as I think every honourable member
recalls, you could see on the horizon a cloud,
perhaps no bigger than a man's hand. In
those years Germany was arming.
While
Great Britain continued te curtail armaments
and endeavoured to convince Germany and
Italy and the other great powers of Europe
that there was no necessity te rearm, yet the
fact remained that what are now known as the
totalitarian states were spending hundreds of
millions of dollars on warlike preparations.
Therefore, if to-day we are to criticize the
Government and the Minister for what they
are net doing, we should also criticize the
preceding Government and the Minister then
in charge of National Defence for what they
did not do.
How much money has been spent since the
present Minister of National Defence took
office? In 1936, shortly after he became Minister of National Defence, he looked over the
situation and found certain conditions. In
1936-37 there was an expenditure of $25,500,000-an increase in his first year of office of
$8,000,000. In 1937-38 the department expended
$35,000,000, as against only $17,000,000 two
years previously. In 1938 approximately the
same amount was spent, $35,500,000. For the
current fiscal year estimates have been brought
down, which no doubt Parliament will pass,
for defence expenditures of $60,000,000.

344

SENATE

What did the present Minister of National
Defence find when he was sworn in? He
found that our stocks of ammunition had not
been replenished, that artillery training was
reduced to twelve men to a battery, that the
infantry had had no camp training at all for
several years.
And what about the air service? When
Colonel Ralston was Minister of National
Defence he spent some money, principally
on what is known as civil aviation. In 1930,
before he relinquished his portfolio, the department was spending $7,147,000 on the air service.
In 1932, just two short years after, that amount

replacement of aircraft, flying hours were
reduced from 32,095 in 1930 to only 1,200 hours
in 1933. lu 1932 the department dismissed
more than 300 trained men from the air service,
including 78 officers, 100 airmen, and 125
technically trained civil personnel.
What were the conditions that resulted from
failure of the former Administration to maintain the Defence Department's progressive
development as it had been carried on in the
years 1926 to 1930, and from the slashing of
defence appropriations between 1930 and 1935?
The heads of the various services reported on
the situation to the present Minister of
National Defence when he took office in the
fall of 1935.
First, with regard to the Naval Service,
what do I find? I find that even to protect
her neutrality Canada required on one coast
6 destroyers, 4 mine-sweepers and 12 auxiliary
vessels. She had only 2 effective destroyers,
2 obsolete destroyers-scrapped the next year
---and 1 inefficient mine-sweeper. The naval
magazine at Esquimalt had been condemned
in 1905. Training ships had been sold, and
the naval college had been closed. Barracks,
dockyards and wii.eless equipment at Halifax
and Esquimalt were hopelessly antiquated and
inadequate.
I have said in this House and elsewhere
that there was no need for a naval college
or for training ships. That statement was
made away back in the years when nobody
dreamed there would be another war. To-day
I feel. as does the honourable senator from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), that the naval
colleges should be opened and that we should
have more training ships than we now have.
What about the Militia Service? This is a
rather delicate subject for me to touch on,
for I must admit that I do not know much
about it. However, for those who wish to
learn, it will be no trouble to read and ascertain the condition that prevailed when the
present Minister of National Defence took
charge.
Our coast defence armament was
obsolescent and defective. Nothing had been

DUFF.

donc about anti-aircraft batteries. There was
no mechanical traction, except for certain permanent force batteries. There were insufficient anti-gas respirators for even the small
permanent force. There were no facilities in
Canada for the manufacture of small arms.
Stocks of ammunition were disastrously low.
The re-organization of the militia on modern
lines, recommended in 1932, had not been
a.cted upon. The training of the militia was
so restricted that few officers and men had
experience in their tasks.
Now I come to the Air Service. There were
no service aircraft suitable for active service
under modern conditions, no air bombs available for immediate use, and no manufacture
of service type aircraft in Canada.
Those were some of the conditions confronting the present Minister of National
Defence when he took charge of his department.
Here are
What is the situation to-day?
some of the things which I find the present
Department of National Defence has done.
The militia has been completely reorganized
on modern mechanized lines. Manuifacturing
facilities for the production of mechanical
equipment for the militia have been developed
in co-operation
with Canadian industry.
Substantial numbers of mechanized units have
alrcady been manufactured. The training of
the militia has been restored to normal.
Technical units receive as much as twentythree days' training.
Militia camps have
been re-established, and training in large
formations has been undertaken. The production of ammunition at the Dominion
arsenal has been greatly increased; in fact, I
am told it has been quadrupled. A few days
ago the arsenal at Lindsay was reopened. The
system of coastal fortification works on the
Pacifie coast has been practically completed
along most modern and efficient lines. In this
connection I was glad the honourable senator
from Edmonton referred to the important part
played by coast defence in case of war.
Guns have been remounted and relined. The
manufacture of machine guns bas been undertaken in Canada for the first time in history.
As an investigation of that matter is at present
being carried on in another place, I shall add
nothing further to what I have already said
on this particular subject.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yeu had better net.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I think the whole investigation is a farce; and as a result of it the
Germans and Italians know to-day that we
are fighting amongst ourselves about the first
contract for guns placed in this country.

of ammunition have been replenished. An
industrial survey of Canada has been practically completed, which places at the disposai
of the department full information as to the
country's capacity for manufacturing war
material.
Now I come to the Navy. During the last
few years the naval strength has been raised.
We now have 6 modern destroyers. Another
vessel, a fiotilla leader, is on the way. Four
mine-sweepers have been built in Canadian
shipyards. Harbour defences at Halifax and
Esquimalt have been acquired. A new magazine has been constructed at Equimalt.
Barracks, dockyards and other shore facilities
for the Navy have been improved and enlarged. The naval personnel has been more
than doubled. A fishermen's reserve has been
organized on the Pacific, and work along this
line has been started on the Atlantic-I am
going to deal with that later on-and stocks
of naval ammunition have been replenished.
I come now to the Air Force. A few days
ago, in this Chamber, the right honourable
leader of the opposition (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), in dealing with another matter,
made the statement that nothing had been
done with regard to the air service.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
planes had been delivered.

I said

Then he went on:
We have no real defences in this country, not
even enough to stop the raider of a chicken
roost.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Now, is that a fact or is
it not? Here is exactly what we have in
the matter of aeroplanes; the Air Force personnel has been doubled, and more than 200
new aircraft have been bought, most of which
have been manufactured in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the honourable gentleman make sure he has exactly
what I said? I referred to three contracts, the
Boeing contract at Vancouver, the Fairchilds
contract at Montreal, and the National Steel

Car contract at Hamilton. I gave figures as
to the number of planes, and I said not one
had been delivered.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am just reading what

Hon. Mr. DUFEF:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I made ne
complaint that there had not been delivery.
I said specifically that I was not complaining.
My point was to show how long it took to get
delivery, and that there was no sense in starting to order planes when war came.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At all events
there is some virtue in starting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Which my right
honourable friend did not do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those were
League of Nations days.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, may
I go on?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Yes, go right along.

friend's remarks, but perhaps it will be as well
if I tell what has happened in regard to
delivery and non-delivery.

Mr.

MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DUFF: The aircraft strength,
as of April 1, 1936, was 164. Of this number
23 were of the service type, and 141 of the
training and survey type. On April 1, 1936,
there were 18 aircraft on order. In the period
from April 1, 1936, to April 1, 1939, there
were 201 aircraft ordered; 106 of the service
type and 95 of the training and survey type.
These 201, with the 18 also on order, make
a total of 219 ordered. By April 1, 1939, there
were 110 of these completed and delivered,
consisting of 40 first-line planes and 70 of the
training and survey type.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Of course, my honourable

than I do. I am not used to it. But the
Minister was speaking about the defence of
Canada, and it was presumed that the aircraft
which he referred to were for the defence of
Canada. If the honourable gentleman wishes
me to do so, I shall read the statement of the
Minister.

it

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I appeal te
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).

Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, I will not eut it all
out. I think I am quite safe in saying that
the 110 aircraft delivered were war machines.
There are still 109 to be delivered, and they
perhaps are what my right honoura-ble friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was referring te.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think my
honourable friend will find that these do net
include the 64 which I referred te.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Of course, if you take
64 from 119 you still have some left. Perhaps
my right honourable friend is overlooking that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The 64 are
net included. My information came from
aircraft men. In trying to impress upon me
how long it took to make deliveries after
contracts had been Jet, they said that over
two years ago, I think, orders were placed
for 18, 18 and 28 ships, that is 64 in all, and
net one had yet been delivered.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am delighted that
my right honourable friend confesses what he
omitted to do when he was leader of the
Government in this Chamber, during the
years 1930 te 1935. Was it net his duty, while
holding that position, te urge that our defence
forces be strengthened? I know he is concerned now to sec that our country is protected, but I say it is not fair for him to
criticize the present Minister of National
Defence because deliveries have net been
made of some aircraft ordered two years ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I have net
criticized him.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well, I do net know
whom my right honourable friend was criticizing. I suppose it was net the contractors.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was just
stating facts, to show that we cannot wait until
war breaks out te begin preparations for
defence. I made no apology at all as to
what was done between 1930 and 1935. As
te that period, all I would say is that those
were League of Nations days.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Would the right
honourable gentleman explain what he meant
by saying we did net have enough defences
te stop the raider of a chicken roost?

Hon. Mr. DUFF: We all know that the
League had a pretty hard time. But I should
not be surprised to learn that the right honourable gentleman attended some of the
League's meetings while he was leader of this
House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I never
attended a League meeting.
On subjects
connected with the League I always refer to
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It is too bad that my
right honourable friend did net go to Geneva.
If he had gone there in 1933, 1934 or 1935
he perhaps would have realized the seriousness of the European situation and, on his
return, advocated the giving of contracts for
aircraft.
In a speech which he delivered here on May
4 the right honourable gentleman said:
We have no real defences in this country, not
even enough to stop the raider of a chicken
roost.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will the honourable gentleman allow me? I would advise
against his being side-tracked by referring te
what was said by someone else. I was hopeful he would round off his statement by telling
us, on the authority of the Minister's speech
of the other day, what the precise position of
our air forces now is. Is the honourable
gentleman through with that subject, or will
he complete it by giving the information I
have alluded, te?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It will be a pleasure te
give that information.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman has told us about the planes we
have had and the planes we are te have. On
page 3481 of the Debates of another place
the Minister gave a statement of our strength
in aircraft as at the lst of April this year,
and I was hoping my honourable friend would
quote from that. I am afraid that if he
enters into dispute with the right honourable
leader on this side, that information will not

MAY 10, 1939
be presented to us. I should- like to have it
given at this stage, and if my honourable
friend wishes I will help him out by reading it.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: No; I can deliver my
own speech. The reason I had not quoted
fromn that part of the Minister's statement
was that I did not want to weary the House
with the figures. I contented myself with
rnentioning the number of aircraft we had in
1935, the number that have been ordered since,
and what deliveries have been made. As the
honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. G.riesbach) says, on page 3481 of the
Debates of another place the Minister gives
a detailed statement of the actual strength
in aircraft at April 1, 1939. 1 cannot quite
see why it is necessary for me to read it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is it in order to read it?
Hon. Mr. DUFE: No, 1 do not think it
is in order to read another person's speech,
but I can quote froma information given in
-another place..
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I objeet to its being read.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: I thank you very much.
Yeu can read it yourself as weIl as I can.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Better.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is a matter of
'opinion. I read the Minister's statement a
few days ago, and I think the figures I have
given this afternoon are correct.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable
gentleman could say that after reading the
Minister's statement he hais learned what
the facts are, and then he could quote the
ifacts.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: I thank my honourable
friend for his suggestion, but I do not feel it
is necessary to quote the figures.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Or he might say
that he is credibly informed.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: Both methods are correct.
Blut I really do not think it is necessary to
quote those figures, because the only point
to, which I was directing attention was my
right bonourable friend's statement that no
aeroplanes had been delivered. He has given
his interpretation of his own. remarks-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not an
interpretation. My statement 18 as plain as
day, exactly as I made it.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: My friend 18 a. lawyerRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I used to be.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I could appeal to seven
lawyers, including rny constitutional friend
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton),
and get seven different constructions upon
what my right honourable friend said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: My right honourable
friend said:
We have no real defences in this country,
flot even enough to stop the raider of a chieken
roost.
That was not a fair statement to make.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is
figurative.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Quite right. And my
right honourable friend was iising his imagination there.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Let it go
at that.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Don't worry. 1 will flot
hurt the right honourable member's feelings
more than I can help. I arn going to quote a
few figures to show that in making that statement my right honourable friend was not fair
to the Department of National Defenee or the
Minister. Let us see wbat the facts are.
First, I will refer to the Naval Branch.
Han. Mr. HAIG: What is the honourable
gentleman reading from?
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: From the Officiai Report
of the House of Commons Debates for
Wednesday, April 26.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, is that in
order? 1 want a ruling.
Right Hlon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think this is
interesting.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Continue.
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: Thanks again. Honourable senators, no one is more desirous than I
arn to keep within the Rules of this Chamber.
I think I arn perfectly j ustified in referring
to certain figures which 1 have in my hand.
For the benefit of the honourable junior
senator from, Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), who
has not been in Parliament as long as some
of us have, may I say it is usual to, quote
figures- which have 'been given in. another
place, so long as we do flot mention that
place by name. I said 'nothing about the
source of my information until the honourable gentleman put his question to me. So
I submit it would be quite in order for me
to give some facts with regard to this
important matter. I cannot understand why
my honourable friend fromn Winnipeg is so
worked up about it.

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: 1 have no objection to
the material which my honourable friend
proposes to read; but the other day, when the
bonourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) was spoaking, the bonourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and his colleagues in the front row
strenuously objected to something being
quoted unless lhe source was disclosed.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is different.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
different point.

Yes, that is a

Hon. Mr. HAIG: He wanted to quote
from Hansard, but that was objected to.
He was advised to say that ho was quoting
from remarks made in another place.
What
is sauce for the gooso is sauce for the gander.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The honourable gentleman is wrong. My honourable friend from
Edmonton did not read from Hansard. He
had before bim a letter or some other
private document, and when askod to givo the
namne of the authýor he doeclined, and quite
properly, in my opinion.
I think the Hfouse would like to bave
correct information as to wbat has been
donc witb respcct to thc defence of this
country. Perhaps a few honourable members
do not want to hear it, but it may be interesting to some people who are less than a
thousand miles awvay. ýIt may serve as an
answer to remarks made by my honourablo
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
and by a gentleman in another place. And
perbaps if my humble words are taken note
of they will have some effect in showing
the world that when it comnes to the defence
of our country we are a united peaple. I
cortainly do not want to, say anything that
could be interpreted to-morrow morning by
papers in Berlin or Rome as an indication
that Canada is divided on this vital matter.
My purpose is to show that the opposite is
true. For that roason I sbould like, with the
permision of the Hbuse, to quote some
figures to prove what we have done and are
trying to do. I admit we have perhaps not
done enough. andl there iq a great deal more
w~e should do, but I say that no reason
exists for criticizing the Department of National Defence on the ground that in tl•o last
three years it has not accomplished as much
as it mighit bave. Why bas it flot done more?
Simply because of criticism from certain individuals and quarters in this country.
I am convinced, honourable members, that
ini the matter of defence we have a inited
Canada. Every man, woman and child in this
country stands on common, ground there.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

If the boys in some of our colleges had been
learning their lessons instead of passing resolutions against conscription and against fighting
for Canada, if tbey bad been content to leave
our defence policy to the statesmen whose
business it is to deal witb it. thero would not
bave been so many stories in the newspapers
suggesting, that our people would not fight to
defend tbemselves. So, whetbor I am in order
or out of order, I should like permission to
quoto somo of the information that I bave
before me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman
is entirely out of order.
Hon. Mr. DITFE: During the last few years
the Government bave purcbased the following
destroyers from the Admiralty:
H.M.CS. St. Laurent
H.M.C.S. Fraser
H.M.C.S. Ottawa
H.M.CS. Restigouche
And one training schooner, the H.M.C.S.
Venture, bias been constructed in Canada.
Besides, the following mine-sweepers have heen
built in this country:
H.M.C.S. Gaspé-that is a gond name.
H.M .C.S. Fundy-anotber gond name.
H.M.C.S. Comox-a British Columbia namne.
H.M.C.S. Nootka-another name obtained
from the Pacific coast.
These minc-swecpcrs were built in Canadian
shipyards. And here I want to say that in
view of the very serious situation that we find
in the world to-day, Canada must do more
than appropriate $60,000,000 for defence.
Because I ýbolieve that our main defences
must ho on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,
1 urge that the Government make contracts
at the earliest possible moment witb sbipyards
in this country for the construction not only
of mine-sweepers, but also of destroyers,
cruisers and submarines.
We know that,
as my right bonourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) bas said, defence equipment
cannot ho procured on short notice. We also
will agree, I think, that sbips of the type 1
bave mentioned can be built here as welI as
in England.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It may ho said that tbey
cannot ho built as cbeaply bore. Some critics
of the Governmcnt may point out that those
four little inine-sweopers cost considerably
more than tbey wouid have if tbey had been
constructed in the Old Country.
Well, as
every business man knows, you cannot produce
anytbing in small quantitios as cheaply as in
large quantities. To bring the cost down we

MAY 10, 1939
must increase the output. And not only
have we the material for building ships here,
but we have the men to construct them. That
was proven by my honourable friend from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). It may be
recalled that he and I crossed swords about
the merchant marine. My only objection to
the merchant marine venture was that we
were too late in going into it. The workmanship on the vessels themselves, which were
built in the shipyards at Sorel, Halifax, and
the Vickers plant, and on the Pacific coast,
could not be beaten. Those vessels were
splendid examples of their type. I say,
honourable members, that the Department of
National Defence should let contracts with
Canadian shipyards for the building of more
war vessels, as an indication to foreign
countries that we realize our responsibilities
as a part of the British Empire, and that if
ever the time comes to protect our rights we
will do our duty.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I spoke a moment ago
about our stocks of ammunition having been
allowed to drop down to the minimum. During the last three or four years the Government have spent $1,299,000 in ammunition
and stores for the Navy.
Our naval establishment at the end of
March. 1939, was represented by six destroyers,
Saguenay, Skeena, Fraser, St. Laurent, Ottawa
and Restigouche; one schooner, the Venture;
seven mine-sweepers, Armentières, Fundy,
Nootka, Gaspé, Comox, Festubert and Ypres;
one motor vessel, the Skidegate; two barracks,
Halifax and Esquimalt; two dockyards, Halifax and Esquimalt.
May I say with regard to the barracks and
dockyards of Halifax and Esquimalt, that
again I join my honourable friend from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and endorse his opinion
that, in what is now perhaps the most serious
crisis in our history, the sooner the Naval
College at Halifax is reopened and training
ships are established, the better.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I come now to the Militia
Branch. For general stores and ammunition
$18.958,000 has been expended. For the last
three years $12,000,000 has been voted, of
which $4,571,000 has been expended, with progress payments to contractors of a further
$2,000,000. The other day, I think, something was said about our having no coast
defences, and our anti-aircraft service being
at the lowest possible ebb. By March 31, 1939,
certain orders for guns had been completed.
Four 3-inch anti-aircraft guns ordered in 1935

349

have been delivered. In addition to the $100,000 paid in the first year, $120,000 has since
been paid. Three heavy coast guns were
relined in Great Britain at a cost of $51,000.
Substantial quantities of ammunition for the
various types of coast defence guns were
acquired from the War Office at a cost of
$123,098.
With regard to mobile artillery, five 3-inch
mortars were procured in England. Substantial quantities of ammunition, fuses, et
cetera, of types not available in Canada for
mobile artillery, were procured from the War
Office at a cost of $371,000.
Of great importance is the fact that with
an expendliture of $820,000 there was developed
in Canada, for the first time since the Great
War, production of the following commodities,
through private industrial sources: shell steel
in the form of billets and forgings; steel base
plates; driving band rings; fuse plugs; propellant in the form of Cordite W; shell filling
in the form of T.N.T.; steel exploder containers; ammunition boxes.
In connection with necessary equipment and
increased production at the Dominion arsenal,
there has been expended in the three years
$1,786.770. When you raid a chicken roost
in the dark the usual course is to wring the
chicken's neck-and that is what I should
like to do with some persons who are making
so much trouble in the world to-day; but
whether we shoot the chicken or wring its
neck, I think my right honourable friend
will agree that $1,700,000 could kill more
than one chicken.
Production of small arms ammunition has
been increased fourfold. This means that the
production during the past three years has
been 21 million rounds greater than it would
have been had the rate of production prevailing in 1935 not been increased. The production of 18-pounder cartridge cases has been
increased sixfold, and the production of percussion primers has been increased at least
sixfold. The gauge plant has been equipped
at Quebec so that the department is now able
to produce its own gauges in a thoroughly
satisfactory manner. There has been expended
on the purchase of equipment and rebuilding
the rolling mill at Lindsay arsenal more than
$100,000 for the purpose of initiating production of cartridge cases. As I have said just
now, this arsenal has been reopened.
With regard to small arms, the department
obtained 82 Vickers machine guns at a cost
of $116,000. In addition there were obtained
10 Bren guns and 7 half-inch anti-tank rifles
froin the War Office, chiefly for training purposes.

SENATE

Then under the head of wireless, equipment
to the value of $128,000 was obtained, including 133 light portable wireless sets and a
number of radio transmitters and receivers
for the permanent force radio stations.
On mechanical equipment and mechanization of existing equipment there bas been
expended $539,560, for which we have obtained:
2 light tanks from the War Office
Conversion of 200 quick-firing 18-pounder
equipment to pneumatic tires
Production in Canada of 51 special trucks
in accordance with War Office standards
Production in Canada of 20 special mechanically propelled vehicles for experimental
purposes
1 dragon from the War Office (a tractor
for hauling heavy artillery)
50 miscellaneous motor vehicles.

I could,
expenditures on other equipment. but I think
I have maide it sufficiently clear that while
the present Covernment have not done all
they should have done, or perhaps would like
to have donc, they, and especially the Minister of National Defence, are seized of the
seriousness of the situation. and will endeavour, notwithstanding adverse criticism froin
some quarters., to do what they can to put our
militia, naval and aircraft forces in a satisfactory condition.
May I revert to the Air Force? I have
already said that its personnel strength bas
been doubled and that more than 200 new
aircraft have heen bought, most of which were
nanufactured in Canada. That is an importWe are now manufacturing
ant matter.
several types of the most modern service
aircraft, thus ensuring continuity of supply
in time of energency. We have a fleet of
Hurricane figbters whichi we acquired from
Great Britain. These are among the fastest
and most efficient fighting aircraft in the
world.
Our stocks of bombs and aircraft
ammunition have been replenished. The systkm of air bases on the Pacifie bas been
developed, and a chain of air bases on the
Atlantic seaboard are in course of development at Yarmouth, Truro and Sydney.
It must net be forgotten that it is not an
easy matter in a few months, or even years,
as my right honourable friend said. to do all
we should like to do. The greatest difficulty
was experienced as te where the department
could obtain essential equipment. Owing to
what had resulted under earlier policies, the
Government had to replace deficiencies as
well as acquire new equipment. To add to
the difficulty, we came into the market at a
time when Great Britain, our customary
Hon.

Mr. DUFF.

source of supply, required the full potential
output of ber industry for her own defence.
This was particularly the case with respect
to anti-aircraft guns. As we all know, it is
only withih the last two years that Great
Britain took steps to secure a supply of
fighting aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns to
defend London. The British Government and
the British people had been doing all they
could to lead the other nations of the world
towards peace. and consequently they were
unprepared for the threatening situation which
developed last year. Why conplain of what
Canada bas done when even in the beart of
the Empire the situation bas been such that
if war had broken out two years ago the city
of London itself would virtually have been
without effective defence from air attacks
and might have been destroyed?
In those circumstances our Governnent had
to look to the development of domestic
sources of supply. It took a long time to
develop production comparable with what
could be produced by industries experienced
in armament manufacture.
We had no
industry engaged in the production of
weapons, service aircraft, anti-gas respirators
and many similar technical items. However,
such an industry bas been created. and there
have been established sources of supply of
essential war materials never before produced
in Canada, ensuring self-maintenance in time
of emergency.
But, more important still, with regard to
defence we have now what is virtually a
united country. Only two years ago Canada
was divided on the subject and a considerable
body of opinion regarded as extravagance a
defence expenditure
of $25.000.000.
This
divergence of opinion resulted, I think, from
the pretty general feeling that there would be
no war. To-day, as I have already said, the
threatening international situation bas, I feel,
convinced 99 per cent of our people that there
is only one thing for Canada to do-look to
our defences. Not only must we defend our
coast-line on the Atlantic and the Pacifie, but
we must also try to protect our trade routes.
But, as my honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) said the other day. we
dlo not know where, in the event of another
war. our first line of defence will be.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Let us pray to God that
there may be no war. But if war does come,
what is the use of my getting up here and
saying, "I am opposed te conscription"? Of
course. I am opposed to conscription, just as
I am opposed te war.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

MAY 10, 1939
Hon. Mr. DUFF: But let me say this. If
war comes and it is necessary for me to help
defend Canada, while I may not be able to
do very much, yet I will do my best. Any
man with children or grandchildren growing
up around him hates war, but what is the
use of anyone in this country saying, "I am
against conscription," when we do not know
what "a day or an hour may bring forth"?
Of one thing let there be no doubt: we will
defend Canada. I agree with my honourable
friend that we do not know where our first
line of defence will be. We hope it will not
be overseas; we hope it will not be either
on our Atlantic or our Pacific coast. Of course,
our first line of defence will not be in Canada.
So far as our neighbour to the south is concerned, I think we can all sleep in our beds
undisturbed by the thought of any threat of
invasion. May I say with all respect to my
honourable friend from Edmonton, who, the
other day, stressed the importance of increasing
both the equipment and the personnel of our
land forces. that it seems to me that if we
ever have to defend Canada it will be from
attack by sea and air.
A few minutes ago I suggested the building of the smaller types of warships, such
as cruisers, destroyers and submarines. My
honourable friend may remember that in the
session of 1937 I advocated the formation
of a naval reserve. By the way, I may say
that if I feel grouchy and inclined to complain of lack of action, I become less critical
when I realize that members of the Government and others charged with great responsibilities should have a great deal of my sympathy.
The Minister of Defence began in a small
way to establish a Naval Reserve. Without
conceit, may I add he did so after I made
that famous speech in this Chamber in 1937.
But he has not gone far enough, and I would
warn this House and the country that we
shall never get anywhere until we lay down a
policy which will be of some national benefit.
As I say, the Minister-and I compliment him
-has made a start. I notice that on the
Pacifie coast his department has enlisted some
200 men. That is very good so far as it goes,
but it is not sufficient.
In 1937 I suggested tha-t we could kill two
birds with one stone, for we have at our disposal the men needed to form a naval reserve.
We have 69,981 fishermen, every one of them
a sailor, and about 50 per cent of them young
men ranging in age from 18 to 35 years. I
submit that those 30,000 men should be immediately enlisted in what I would term a Royal
Naval Reserve, and trained and equipped for
national defence. I have suggested the building of warships of the smaller types in Cana-

351

dian shipyards. Well, it is no use to build
ships unless you have the men to man them.
In my speech of two years ago I stated that
other countries had built up their navy from
a naval reserve, and I quoted France as an
example. For the last fifty years France has
enlisted her fishermen into the navy either
directly or through her naval reserve. In
order to encourage the fishermen to enlist,
the Government of France have for the last
fifty years paid a bounty on every quintal of
fish caught. The bounty was 10 francs a
quintal when the franc was worth 20 cents,
and to-day, with its value at only 3 cents, the
bounty is 40 francs. A quintal is equivalent
to 124 pounds. The bounty is equivalent to
about $1.20 in Canadian currency. When the
fishermen come home from the fishing grounds
they go either to the training ships or to the
regular warships and receive technical training. If we established a system of that kind
we should be doing something for a great
industry.
There is no question that if any primary
industry has been neglected by all our governments it is the fishing industry. I am
convinced that there is more opportunity for
developing this than any other primary
industry in the Dominion. In view of the
fact that this great industry can be developed,
and that hundreds and thousands of men are
walking the streets of towns and villages on
both the Atlantic and the Pacifie coasts, it
seems to me that this Government, or any
Government, should give it all the encouragement possible by way of a bounty on fish,
or in some other form, and should enroll
these young men in the Naval Reserve. They
would then be available in time of stress,
just as the Newfoundland boys were during
the last war, when they went overseas and
helped to prevent German merchant ships
from entering or Ieaving their ports and
carrying supplies to the German people. The
men I speak of would be the very best kind
of sailors. Of course it is useless to have
sailors unless you have ships, and it is useless
to have ships unless you have sailors to man
them. While our own ships are being built,
let us secure obsolete ships from the British
Navy and use them for training purposes.
I say there is an opportunity here to buiId
up a great industry, and at the same time to
help these young men who are walking the
streets because of unemployment. I am not
criticizing the Government. I know what a
difficult task governments have had to face
since 1930 in relation to unemployment. But
here is a chance to help boys who cannot buy
fishing boats of their own. If they were
assisted in procuring fishing boats they would
be able to go out and bring in new wealth to

352

SENATE

the country, and if they were trained during
thec off season they would make excellent
sailors or naval officers. I arn very glad the
Government have made a start towards
establisbing a Naval Reserve.
1 notice that it is the intention of the
Government to ýbuild another training sbîp on
the Pacifie ocean. 1 have no objection to
that proposaI, but I say it does flot go far
enough if we are to do anything worth while.
Some people have criticized me in the past,
and have accused me of flot going far enougb,
because I said we eould depend on the Unit-ed
States to help us if war came. I still maintain
that that is truc. The United States, in their
own intýerest, wjll nevcr allow an enemy to
enter their country through Canada. This
means that we can hold up our heads without
shame, and in time of war can accept from
the United States any hielp they may give us.
Ex erybody knows that money expended for
war purposes money spent on armaments or
on warships-is money put into non-productixe
industry, and that the greater the expenditure
in this direction the heavior the burden which
will have to be borne hx' those whio are biere
now and those wbo xviii follow after. In view
of wbat has hiappened iii tbe worid during
the last few years people in high places are
endeavouring, botbi in a religions way and
otberwise, to dissipate the xvar clouds. They
are endeavouring to convey to those who are
war-minded thic idea that peace on earth i.4
better than anytbing else. Nex'ertheless, we,
as a self-respecting people. must endeavour
to do in our own small way whatevor we
possiblv can te protect Canada, either witbin
olur on n boundaries, or, as I hope will neyer
be neoessary, outside of tbem.
Wbat baxve this Government endeavoured
to do with regard to the air service? For sexerai
years past thcy have sent 15 air pilots each
year to the Royal Air Foi-ce; and there
are now at least 50 British puis who will
train in Canada. I say that in Ibis field also
there is an opportunity to take up some of the
slack in regard to unemployment.

PRINTING OF PARLIAMENT
REPORT 0F JOINT OOMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. WHITE moved concurrence in
the first report of the Joint Committee on the
Printing of Parliament.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I asked yesterday for the postponement of the adoption of this report until we
bad had an opportunity to look At over.
To-day, aftcr having looked over a printed
record of some twenty pages, I wond-er
whether, without too mucli trouble,' we could
not secure a great deal of information by
means of the inclusion in this report of a
little more than is printed. I quote onc item
for ready reference. It is No. 288, whicb reads
as follows:

35

Return showing:
1. The total expenditures on defence by Canada for each of the years 1921 to 1938.
2. The total strength at present of officers,
non-commissioned officers and men of Canada's
(a) militia and permanent force, (b) air force,
(c) navy.
3. What Canada's navy consista of, and where
it is located at present.
The point I want to, make is this. If immediately below these three questions there
were printed the answers, which. were given
in another place, the information would be
of great value to us in connection with the
subject of the national defence of Canada.
Tbe saine remarks would, apply to a number
of other items. It may lie that some of the
answers are too volu-mihous to lie printed,
,but in the case I have cited the information
would be valuable to every member who bas
bad under consideration the subject of national
defence. I wonder wbetber, another year,
the Joint Committee on Printing would not
take under advisement the possibility of gîving this House some of the information that
is given in another place in regard to these
returns.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I may informn my bionourable friend tbat the information is available. It cari lie secured by simply making
application to the proper source.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know that. I
have already made application for four or
five of these returns, and have them in my
hand now. My thouglit is that if we had
the answers, wbich would not take up any
more space than the questions, the information would lie in such condensed form as to
lie more vabiable than the papers covering the
answers. It seems to me it would simplify
the matter.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: It is for the committee
to decide. When an item cornes before the
committee any member of the committec bas
a riglit to request that it lie printed. I think
the committee is to lie commended for its
attitude. It bas endeavoured to keep down
expense, and to avoid the printing or pulilishing in pamphlet f orm, of documents which,
as we ahl know, bave been ddstriliuted promiscuously in the past at a tremendous cost to
the country. That is the reason why the
committee bas taken the attitude that this
information, which is available, should lie
produced by application to the proper
authority.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn only pointing
out that if fifteen or twenty senators were
to ask for copies of the answers to questions

71498-23
Z&VIME

SENATE

354

set out in some of these returns-for example,
No. 288-it would cost more to typewrite or
mimeograph the answers than to have them
printed right below the questions where they
appear in our Minutes. I am making these
remarks merely by way of a suggestion, which
I would ask the committee to consider next
year.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I would suggest that
my honourable friend become a member of
the committee next sessionHon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, thank you.
Hon. Mr. WHITE:-and then he would be
able to designate .returns with respect to
which he thought answers should, be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
BANKING AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it
should go on record that the Bill respecting
the marketing of wheat and the Bill respecting
the marketing of other farm products are in
the opinion of Counsel for this House invalid
on constitutional grounds, and that in this
opinion at least certain members of the
committee agree. I am not objecting to the
Bills passing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might add that
our Counsel speaks of the constitutional
invalidity of these Bills in relation to a late
judgment of the Privy Council, whieh he hopes
may be revised one of these days.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know how far

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would remind

MAY 11, 1939
ing the inquiry the committee was re-appointed
on March 7th of this year, since which time
it has held eleven sessions and examined fourteen further witnesses. The proceedings of the
committee, as recorded during the session of
1938 and to date during the present session,
covered 1,903 printed pages, and 106 exhibits
bearing on the problem have been filed with
the committee.
The submissions to the committee have been
of great value and interest to the members and
have served to enlighten the country at large
upon this very important question. As a result
of the inquiry, it is possible that the Canadian
people have acquired another view-possibly a
totally different view-as to what our National
Railway property stands for in the life of the
Canadian people. To many it has no doubt
seemed that our National Railways have been,
as it were, a drag upon Canadian progress
because of the deficits. To many Canadians it
will doubtless be news that the Canadian
National Railways have no operating loss and
that the deficits, about which se much has been
heard and which admittedly have such a serious
effect upon our national finances, pertain
entirely to interest charges due public investors
and relate for the most part to former privatelyowned lines which the government took over
and continued in operation in the national
interests. It is important alse te bear in mind
that the interest referred te is guaranteed by
the Government of Canada and is a, continuing
obligation regardless of what disposition be
made of the National lines.
The committee was impressed with the large
measure of public service rendered by the
Canadian National Railways in the interests of
pioneering and development, the cost of which
is included in the deficits referred te. These
services are of great value in the economic
development of the country, but cannot be
operated ýat a profit from the purely railway
standpoint.
It is felt that it would be
disastrous policy te attempt te eliminate railway deficits by the withdrawal of essential
railway facilities.
There was exhibited before the committee a
large scale map, indicating that out of a total
of 21,972 miles of line in Canada, and on a
traffic level equal te 1937, 4,034 miles earn
enough te pay operating expenses, taxes and
interest charges, 4,087 miles pay operating
expenses, but fail te earn sufficient te fully
meet taxes and interest, while 13,851 miles
fail te earn enough revenue even to pay operating expenses. From this it will lie noted what
a large percentage of non-paying Canadian
National mileage has te be carried by the paying or marginal lines. Nevertheless the marginal
and the non-paying lines make a valuable contribution te the national life of Canada, which
contribution cannot be measured by the yardstick of ordinary business returns. It has been
utilized as an instrument of national development and obliged te operate extensive mileage
for reasons of national policy.
The committee was impressed aise with the
great potential value attaching te National lines
which are located se as te make possible the
development of the immense mining and forest
areas of Northern Canada. The National Railways are splendidly located for the future
development of the Dominion, and if the
evidence taken by the committee should do
nothing more than direct attention te the potential value of the National Railways te the
future of Canada it will have served a useful
public purpose.

In like manner, the evidence placed before the
committee has been illustrative of the value
te the Dominion of the Canadian Pacific Railway system. What the Canadian Pacific has
meant te Canada, both at home and abroad,
is, your committee feels sure, appreciated by
all thinking Canadians. It has shown courage
and enterprise, has had a major share in the
development of Western Canada, and Canadian
Pacific service has been a credit te this country
in all parts of the world. The financial reputatien of the Canadian Pacific has been equally
high, and no other field of investment in normal
times seemed te offer greater opportunity. In
that way, the Canadian Pacifie has attracted
te the Dominion much capital from all parts
of the world, and the credit of that company
has been second only te that of the Dominion
itself. That the earning power of the Canadian
Pacific under present abnormal conditions has
been so seriously impaired is no reflection upon
the management of that company, but is largely
due te world conditions from which its national
rival and practically every railway on the
North American continent have been suffering.
Notwithstanding this general situation, Sir
Edward Beatty assured the committee, during
its 1938 inquiry, that lie was net alarmed over
the outlook for the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
By strict economy that company has been able
te survive the stress of recent years, and lie
looked forward with confidence to the future.
It is satisfactory te note alse that at the recent
annual meeting of the Canadian Pacific shareholders, Sir Edward Beatty found it possible
te state that it was his conviction that in spite
of the difficulties which it faces, the Canadian
Pacific is in a position te maintain its independent existence for years te come.
One prominent fact develops from the evidence
adduced before the committee, namely, that the
trend of railway .transportation in Canada, as
elsewhere, is steadily downward. That evidence
shows that a comparison of the years 1935, 1936
and 1937 with 1923 indicates an appreciable
increase both in production in Canada and in
the volume of banking business, while, on the
other hand, the gross revenues of the railways
show a decline amounting to 26 per cent in
1937. This decline has taken place notwithstanding the fact that the population of Canada
increased frem approximately 9 millions in 1923
te Il millions in 1937.
The principal reasens for that decrease may
be attributed te the growth of competition on
the highways, inland waters and shipments
through the Panama Canal. The major development of highway competition occurred between
1923 and 1937. During the same period purely
Canadian trafflc through the Welland Canal
increased from 3 million tons te il millions,
and purely Canadian freight through the
Panama Canal from 1 million te 4 million tons
annually over the period. At the same time,
passenger traffic on Canadian railways declined
aise 50 per cent.
Evidence given te the committee indicated
that highway competition is practically unrestricted as regards regulation, carries the
cream of the traffic, and operates most effectively during the non-winter months.
As
opposed te this, the railways are extensively
regulated, and must operate under all weather
conditions. Because of these disadvantages te
the railways, the Government has recently
offered a measure of relief through the "agreed
charge" feature of The Transport Act, 1938.
By the provisions of this Act, the railways are

SENATE
now enabled to make contracts with shippers
on an "agreed charge" basis for through business. It is too soon to determine the possible
effect of this new legislation upon the situation,
but your committee is satisfied that the position
of the railways to-day in the transportation
field is quite different from that of 1923.
In the opinion of some members of the committee the emphasis which bas been placed upon
Canadian National deficits bas from the outset
of the inquiry placed our National Railway
System in a somewhat false position before the
public, wlo, previous to this inquiry, had no
comprehensive knowledge of the development
of the Canadian National System and the service it bas rendered to the country. Unfortunately its debt and deficits seemed to stand
as an indictment against its administration, and
although Canadian Pacific business was also
on the down grade, and was fighting its own
battle, its contribution before the committee
upon Canadian
entire attention
focussed
National Railway deficits as though they were
the cause of ail our railway troubles. The
psychology of this situation placed the Canadian National Railways in the position of having
to defend and justify its administration.
The establishment of this committee followed
a campaign of propaganda on behalf of unification which bas been carried on by the President
of the C.P.R. since the recommendations of the
Duff Commission were placed upon the statute
book. Though no evidence was produced before
us tending to show that either of the two railways attempted to delay or impede co-operative
action under the 1933 Act, we feel that in the
very nature of things co-operation bas been
made more difficult to achieve while one of the
parties lias been engaged in a vigorous campaign to convince the public that the results of
co-operation vill be negligible and that unification is the only practical solution. We feel,
further, that this campaign of propaganda bas
obscured the underlying problem of the adjustment of the railway industry to the changed
conditions brought about by the development
of highway transport. Your committee is of
opinion that the problem created by highway
transport is one which will require much study
to co-ordinate the new and the old agencies
of transport so as to obtain the maximum
economic advantages of both. A very considerable part of the Canadian railway problem
arises from this veritable revolution in the art
of transportation.
The chief proposal under consideration was
that of the Canadian Pacifie Railway for the
unification of the two railways, it being contended on behalf of that plan that savings of
$75,000,000 annually could be made for the
combined properties on a 1930 traffie level, or
of some $56,000,000 to $59,000,000 on a 1937

traffic level.
into these possibilities, from which it appeared
that only a portion of the savings could be
definitely measured, and these applied more
particularly to road abandonments which, in
the judgnent of the committee, could not be
made.
Details of other savings reiating to the closing
of shops, stations and other facilitis, as well
as reduction of train services, were not disclosed by the Canadian Pacifie. Thus it was
impossible for the committee te give consideration to the proposals included in the larger
sphere of savings, and the reluctance of the
Canadian Pacifie to divulge this vital information because of possible publie reaction did
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

not assist the committee to reach a conclusion
favourable to unification.
This lack of vital information was not confined to estimated savings, but, as was developed
during the 1938 sessions of the committee, was
apparent as well in the consideration of the
possible distribution of joint savings between
the Government and the Canadian Pacifie, when
the committee was unable to ascertain from
representatives of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, except in general terms, how joint net
revenue under unification would be divided.
Further leading questions to the Canadian
Pacifie in relation to financial matters under
unification, such as new capital requirements,
refunding of Canadian Pacifie maturing obligations in the event of unification, and tle
inevitable pledge that the Government would
be obliged to give in connection with the new
borrowings, all remained practically unanswered.
In other respects also objections appeared to
the committee to the adoption of unification, it
being felt that any form of unification which
attempts to preserve within one administration
the principles of private and public ownership
would be unworkable, the state being bound
to become involved financially, with the result
that it would be impossible afterwards te
unscramble the properties and revert to the
The adoption of such a policy
status quo.
would, in the opinion of many members of the
committee. lead inevitably to government ownership of all Canadian railways. There was the
added danger, referred to by the Duff Commission, which would be involved in setting up
a railway monopoly in Canada-a state within
a state. In view of these considerations your
committee feels that unification cannot be recommended as a measure of public policy.
In view of this your committee explored as
thoroughly as possible tho alternative of co-operation. It was contended by officials of the
National Railways that all savings practicable
of attainment could be secured under a policy
of enforced co-operation, with respect to which
it was hel( that savings of from $10.000.000
to $15.000,000 miglit be effected, even under
present depressed condition of railway transport. N oevertheless. soe members of the comnittee felt that greater savings than these
might be secired from unification if the people
of Canada were prepared to pay the price of
such drastie curtailment of railway services,
with attendant disabilities from the national
and publie standpoint, as bas been already
alluided to.
It is recognized by your committee that
the adoption of co-operative measures lias been
disappointimly slow-

and there is reason to fuel tînt considerable
ecoiiomy can be secured fromi co-operation if

reason w1y duplicate services and duplicate

facilities culd not be dealt with effectively by
co-operation, and it is not considered advisable
to modify the terms of the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act, 1933, except as regards
diismissal compensation for emploees. until the
possibilities of the present Act have been more
thoroughly ascertained. In any event, your
comirmittee fouls that the facts whiclh it bas
brouglht to the knowledge of the publie as to
the slow progress of co-operative plans to date
have lad a valuable effect in stimulating both

MAY 11, 1939
railway systems to further efforts in this
direction. We have recently been advised that
a number of important plans for co-operation
are now under study, including a proposal for
a complete pooling of 'all com-petitive passenger
train services throughout the country, whieh
offers an opportunity for important economies.
Complaint has been voiced by members of
the committee that, though five years have
elapsed since co-operation as a measure of
government policy became effective, so little
bas been accomplished. That criticism would
seem to lose sight of the fact that even under
unification five years and more would be
required to secure expected results.
The evidence submitted to the committee
makes it clear that Canada's railway problem
cannot be solved at one stroke. Any attempt
te solve it by drastic measures may be expected
to produce even greater problems on account
of the disturbance to communities served,
because railways in most of Canada are and will
remain an essential part of the country's transport facilities. The committee feels that the
situation may be ameliorated by co-operation
aimed at ýelimination of duplicate services where
no essential public interest is involved. A
further amelioration may be expected as the
economic spheres of rarilway and highway transport become more clearly defined and the competition between them is placed upon a fair
and equitable basis of regulation and taxation.
This is the general problem which is actively
engaging the ,attention of governments not only
in Canada, but in the United States -and Great
Britain.
The committee has looked closely into the
suggestion of the Canadian Pacific Railway
that the evidence before the committee be
submitted to a' firm of railway engineers and
accountants of high standing, free from all
interest in either railway system, to the end
that such firm may study such evidence and
especially lits practical railway engineering and
accounting

features,

and make

such physical

examination as it may deem necessary, with
a view to making a full report as to what in
the judgment of such firm would be the amount
of savings which could be effected by a system
of dinified management. and to what extent, if
any, such savings would entail an impairment
of services to the Canadian people.
After due consideration, the committee
reached the conclusion that the proposed reference to an outside body was not practicable
in view of the fact that the essentials of
the problem are not alone of railway practice,
but involve questions of broad national policy,
which have to hc decided upon by the Canadian
Parliament and its executives. Such responsibilities cannot be delegated.
The committee, however, would recommend
that the evidence submitted and the exhibits
filed be reported, and thus made -available to
all who may be interested in the Canadian
transportation problem. It is felt that much
valuable evidence has been added to the public
record. It 'brings up to date the record made
available in tfhe first instance by tie report
of the Drayton-Acworth-Sm-ith Commission of
1917, and so greatly added to by the Duff
Commission of 1931-32. That Commission went
more f ully into the railway question than it
has been possible for this committee to do.
The membership of the Duff Commission
included one of the leading successful railway
executives of the United States, as well as the
man

who

l

of

the

London

(Englanf) Passenger Transport Board. That
Commission, which made a physical examina-

357

tion of the principal properties of both railway systems, took occasion to close its report
as follows:
"We feel compelled as a matter of public
duty, to strike a serious note of warning to
the people of Canada. Unless the country as
prepared to adopt the plan we have proposed,
or some

other equally effective measures,

to

secure the efficient and economical working of
both railway systems and thereby not only
reduce the burden on the federal treasury but
improve the financial position of the privatelyowned railway, then the only courses that would
be left would be either to effect savings in
national expenditure in other directions, or
to add still further to the burdens under which
the industries of the country are suffering by
the imposition of yet further taxation. Failing
the adoption of one or other of these courses,
and there are obvious limits to their appl-ioation, the very stability of the nation's finances

and the financial credit of the Canadian Pacific
Railway will be threatened with serious consequences to the people of Canada and to
those who have invested their savings in that
railway."
The recommendations thus referred to were
enbodied in the Statutes of Canada, but their
working out bas not been assisted by a desire
of one of the railways to impose upon the
people of Canada a policy rejected by the Duff
Commission for the same reasons wahich compel
this committee once more to reject unification
as a measure of national policy. In the opinion
of the comnittee it is in the interest of the
railways and of business generally that the
uncertainty resulting from the Canadian Pacifia
agitation for unification be ended by frank
recognition of the fact that unification of the
railways is not possible of adoption, and that
further and more serions attempts ahould be
made to give effect to the letter and the spirit
of the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifia Act
of 1933, the two railways to agree between
themselves to a referee-preferably the Chairman of the Board of Transport Commissionera
-for the adjustment of such differences as may
arise concerning co-operative policies. That, in
the opinion of the committee. offers the only
practical

course

looking

to

the

improvement

of our present railway difficulties.
Tie committee is of the opinion that this
adjustment of differences with respect to cooperative measures can be accomplished within
the confines of the 1933 Act which, for the
purposes of effecting economies and providing
for more remunerative operation, directs both
railways to agree, and continuously to endeavour
to agree, upon such co-operative measures, plans
and arrangements as are fair and reasonable
and best adapted to effect such economies.
As to the selection of a referee, that legislation provides that the Chief Commissioner
of the Board of Transport Commissioners
shall be presiding officer of any arbitral
tribunal, to whioh each railway shall appoint
a representative, and on matters of sufficient
importance two additional members may be
anpointed by the President of the Exchequer
Court. or a judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada. This provision of the Act has never
yet been set in motion. though it may be
invoked at request of either company.

of other members of the committee, there
was discussion as to the necessity of getting
on with this debate before we reach the

without any expressed disagreement on the

should be an objection now. I hope it will

FARMERS'

CREDITORS
MENT ACT

ARRANGE-

DISCUSSION

Hon. J. J. HUCHES rose in accordance
with the following notice:
Inasnuch as we are not likely to have the
annual report of the administration of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act for the
last fiscal year in time to discuss it this session,
and inasmuch as we have already received some

MAY 11, 1939
figures in regard to the administration of said
Act for the year 1938-39, the consideration of
which would probably give the Government and
Parliament information whicli they should have
at as early a date as possible, I therefore give
notice that I shall on Wednesday next call the
attention of the Senate to the interim figures
which were furnished, to their implications, and
to some other features of the administration of
said Act.
He said: Honourable members, my reasons
for wishing to say a few words to the House
at the present time are briefly set out in
my notice on the Order Paper. I know it is
hard for members from the other provinces
of Canada to realize fully how the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act has been administered on Prince Edward Island. And the
end is not yet, nor will it be for some time.
I shall not weary the House with details, but
shall touch upon some of the high spots only,
and hope that from these honourable members
will be able to realize what the details must
be like.
For -the fiscal year ending the 31st of
March, 1937, the last period for which we
have full returns, it cost the Government to
administer the Act on Prince Edward Island
$36,489.03; in New Brunswick, $26,177.26, and
in Nova Scotia, $4,957.26. These figures are
taken from the Auditor General's report. In
New Brunswick there are three times as many
farmers as on Prince Edward Island, and in
Nova Scotia a little over two and a half
times as many. Taking the agricultural
population of the three provinces into
account, the cost of administering the Act in
the Island province would be four and a half
times as great as in New Brunswick, and eighteen times as great as in Nova Scotia.
But that is not all. According to an answer
given by the Government to the honourable
senator from Cardigan (Hon. John A. Macdonald), which will be found on page 162
of Unrevised Hansard of May 5 last, the
three official receivers on Prince Edward
Island obtained for their services in 1937
$4,019.11, and in 1938 they obtained $8,905.08,
or a thousand dollars more than twice as
much. Now let us remember that the official
receivers are the men who initiate all proceedings under the Act. Everything else
depends upon and bears a relation to what
these men begin. Therefore it is reasonable
to assume that if the cost under this head
was more than double what it was for the
preceding year, it would at least be doubled
under all the other heads. This brings the
probable cost of administration of the Act on
Prince Edward Island for the year 1938 to
nine times what it was in New Brunswick,
and thirty-six times what it was in Nova
Scotia.

Hon. Mr. POPE: You

a

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I do not know what
amount of property was taken from one class
of people on Prince Edward Island and given
to another class; the administrators of the
Act say it was large; but I do know that in
some instances, at least, the creditors were
in more needy circumstances than the debtors.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: This fact did not,
however, weigh with the administrators. When
it came to giving away other people's property
their generosity was boundless, and when it
came to making up their own expense
accounts their kindness to themselves was
phenomenal, as the
mentioned
figures and estimates will show.
In this connection an incident occurred in
the Banking and Commerce Committee about
a year ago. which should be related. Mr.
H. F. Gordon, director or manager of the Act
at Ottawa, was before the committee, giving evidence. I asked him to tell the committee what 'his duties were. He said that
part of them was to check the expense accounts
that came in from the administrators of the
Act in the several provinces, and to see that
they were properly made up. I asked him
if he had ever found any of these accounts to
be too large, and he told me he had so found,
and had to reduce them accordingly. I then
asked him if he had ever found any of them
to be too small, and he told me that he had
so found, and had to see that they were
increased accordingly. These questions and
answers did not appear to convey much
significance to the great majority of the members of the committee, but to me they were
very revealing, because of what I already
knew.
Another incident occurred just a year ago,
which should be mentioned. A bill was before
the Senate to amend the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act of 1934. The honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
read a memorandum which had been prepared
by Mr. H. F. Gordon, director of the Act at
Ottawa, designed to show business conditions
on Prince Edward Island, and the practical
slavery in which the farmers of that province
were being held by the merchants. The
honourable leader read that memorandum,
frankly declaring that he did so in order to
influence the attitude of the members on the
pending bill. Now, what will be thought of
the situation when I re-declare and reaffirm
to the members of this House that the statements in that memorandum in respect to
•previously

360

SENATE

Prince Edward Island were viciously, maliciously, and absolutely untrue, and even idiotically untrue.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Poetically?

Explain.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I could explain, but
it would take quite a little while.
When I was properly characterizing that
memorandum, the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) came to its
defence, saying that he endorsed every statement in it, and declaring that the administration of the Act on Prince Edward Island was
being honestly and properly carried out.
There is another feature of this business
which must not be overlooked, and which will
show that a proper administration of the Act
could not be expected on Prince Edward
Island, because of the type of officials
appointed. One of the administrators had
been removed from the Bar Society of the
province for offences which I shall not mention,
and was afterwards appointed to this lucrative
position under the Crown. He was not disbarred for teaching Sunday School. This
man must have been recommended to the
Minister or Department of Finance by some
person or persons on the Island, who had the
power and the right to make such recommendations, and I feel sure that the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) is acquainted with that person, or
those persons. This man was and is one of
the official receivers under the Act, and all
reports go to show that he has been a very
busy official since his appointment. In fact,
so busy was he, soliciting new business during
the summer and fall of 1938, that he employed an assistant. and I should, I think,
recount some of the activities of both men.
I have been told that they travelled through
the country, interviewed farmers and got
many applications because of this soliciting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
assistant disbarred too?

Was the

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No. The assistant was
net a lawyer.
Hon. J. A. MACDONALD (RichmondWest Cape Breton): Was he a merchant?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I shall give the
particulars of one case, namely that of Mr.

borrowed two hundred dollars from A. P.

for payement. The interest was at the rate of

informed him that if he would make application under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, his interest would be cut to 5 per
cent or less, and that he would get whatever
time he wanted to pay the principal; and
further, that the application would cost him
(Cheverie) nothing. On the 21st of December,
1938, Mr. Holmes notified Mr. McQuaid, the
mortgagee, that Fred Cheverie had made an
application to have the interest on his mortgage reduced, and that the case would be heard
in Holmes's office in Charlottetown on the
31st of December, at 11.30 a.m. Mr. McQuaid
immediately wrote Cheverie, expressing surprise that he had made application to any
official of the Farmers' Credit Arrangement
Act for a reduction in interest, when he
(McQuaid) would have made a reduction if
Cheverie had asked for it. I shall read

Dear Sir:
In regard to your letter which I received a
few days ago, I think you are under the impression that I was into Charlottetown and
raising the dickens about getting my interest
rate lowered. Well, I want you to believe I
did nothing of the kind, for I have found you
always reasonable in our business relations.
One day in the fall when I was busy threshing,
a fellow drove along and asked me if I would
like to have my interest rate lowered. He went
on to say that he was a Government man sent
around to those people owing niortgages to tell
them he could get their rate lowered and of
course I told him if everyone else was having
theirs lowered I might as well have mine also
and that was all I ever thought or heard about
it till I got your letter a few days ago. As
I said before, I have always found you very
reasonable in our dealings and I hope we will
continue that way.
Wishing you a very happy, healthy and
prosperous Nev Year. I remain
Yours truly,
Fred Cheverie,

remember what the "guy's" name was who was

This is the notice to creditors which was

The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934
Notice to creditors
In the matter of a proposal for a composition, extension or scheme of .arrangement of
Frederick Cheverie of Elmira, Farmer.
Take notice that Frederick Cheverie, residing in the county or district of King's, in
the Province of Prince Edward Island, has
submitted to me for the consideration of his
creditors a proposal for a composition (or
extension of time or scheme of arrangement).
A gen-eral meeting of crediitors will be held

I, Frederick Cheverie of Elmira, in the
county or district of King's in the Province
of P. E. Island, do solemanly declare that
the above statement-that he cannot meet his obligations unless
he has a reduction of interest and extension
of time-gives to the 'best of my knowledge 'and belief
a full, true and complete statement of my
affairs on this 10th day of November, 1938,
and fully discloses 'all my property, and I
make thîis declaration knowing it to be of the
same force and effect as if made under catbh
and by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act.
(Signed) Frederick Cheverie.
Solemnly declared before me at Charlottetown in the county or district of Queen's in
the Province of P. E. Island this 10th day of
November, 1938.
(Signed) Gardon R. Holmes,
A Commissioner, etc.
Proposal
To my secured creditor I propose the mortgage be extended for a period of 5 years with
interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum,
to be due as at present due date.
Cheverie bas 208 acres of land, 60 acres of
which are under cultivation, the rest, I
presune, being woodland. The farm is in a
fair state of. cultivation. He has a full supply
of farm machinery and is a farmer in fair
circumstances. All he owed was this mortgage
of $200.
An Hon. SENATOR: A very lucky man.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: He was a lucky man.
He was brought under this Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act and, I understand, got a
reduction in interest of 2 per cent a year, or $4.
The mortgagee would willingly have given
him this accommodation.
The transaction
will cost the Government of Canada three or
four times the reduction that Cheverie will
get in five years. Is it any wonder the
administration of the Act is costing money
in Prince Edward Island when it is in the
hands of men of the kind I have indicated?
If my information is correct, they wilýl continue
to administer the Act for some time.
I have a letter from Mr. McQuaid to Mr.
Holmes, drawing Mr. Holmes's attention to
the fact that Cheverie was not in Charlottetown when be is supposed to have made before
Holmes the declaration which I have placed
on Hansard. Holmes said he was so busy last
summer and fall taking applications because
of the impending termination of the Act on
December 31 that perhaps he made a "few
mistakes," but, if so, he would rectify then,
as lawyers never took advantage of one
another.
I understand that if a magistrate, or a Government official empowered to take sworn
declarations, prepares and signs a bogus
declaration in which he is personally interested,
be commits an offence against the Criminal
Code, punishable by severe penalties. I think

that this matter and the whole administration of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act on Prince Edward Island should be
investigated. I have statements from many
farmers showing how they were importuned
last summer and fall to come in under the
Act and help thenselves financially, but if
what I have already related is not sufficient
to open the eyes of the departmental officials
at Ottawa who are Mr. Gordon's superiors,
as to how they have been deceived by the
racketeers on Prince Edward Island, they are
blinder than Bartimeus was, and have great
need of a surgical operation, or a miracle.
We are shocked, and I think rightly so,
when we read of some of the things that are
done in Alberta under provincial legislation
and by provincial officials, but our complacency does not appear to be much disturbed when we hear of the things done under
federal legislation and by federal officials on
Prince Edward Island. Is it because the
things done on Prince Edward Island appear
to have the support of judges and of at least
one senator? Last year, when the senator
from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), the
senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur)
and myself were trying to get some stop put
to what was being donc on the Island, the
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)

SENATE

told us that we were powerless; that all we
could do was to make a noise; that the racket
would go on. And it not only went on, but
during the summer and fall months became
greatly intensified; which proves that the
senator from Queen's knew what he was
talking about, and that the increased activity
was no accident. It is still going on. The
whole niachinery is still in existence, and
under pay, I suppose. On the 5th of last
month the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) told the honourable
senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
that even the official receivers were still at
work on the details of the applications they
had received months before; and on the 28th
April he told the honourable the senior senater from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) that
he hoped the payments to the official receivers
would soon be stopped. The whole thing has
become a public scandal, and it never could
have attained such proportions if it had not
received active support from Ottawa. I
thought it my duty, even at this stage of the
game, to lay these few facts before the House,
beoause I believe that if public opinion does
not take bold of this thing similar rackets
will be tried.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I take occasion to read
from a communication I have received on
this same subject from a practising barrister
in a relatively small town in Manitoba. He
has been there, I should judge, for anywhere from forty to fifty years. He is well
known, and his reputation is well known to
every senator from the province. This letter
is, I think, the only one I have ever had
fron him in my life. I just read extracts:
As you are not practising in Manitoba, I
do not suppose you have any idea what a
disastrous effect such legislation as the F.C.A.
Act, Debt Adjustment Acts, etc., have had on
the business morality of some people. Before
such legislation was in force there were those
whose word could be relied on to carry out a
promise. Now it is not a question of how a
farmer can pay bis debts, but what he can
get out of. Consequently the credit of the
farmers has been destroyed.
Now I read of an incident for which he
vouches:
For instance I know of one farmer who had
a $31,000 mortgage reduced to $14,000 and
extended over a long period. Within a few
weeks the farmer purchased a new car, and
the whole family went to California for the
winter. This is only one of many cases that
has come under my own personal observation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
While listening te the statement from Prince Edward
Island I was thinking of the distressful
situation of my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), and I have come
Hon. Mr. HUHES.

to the conclusion that he is quite justified
in expressing repentance at having passed
such a law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have
expressed repentance, and my conduct is in
accordance with my words.
STATE

OF CANADA'S

DISCUSSION

DEFENCE

CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the question proposed
by Hon. Mr. Griesbach, calling the attention
of the Senate to the state of the defence of
Canada.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I rise not to make what I
should consider a contribution to the debate
on our foreign relations, but for a more
special purpose. As to the general question
of our defence, I have many times expressed
my views on the principles which should
govern. I have often done so in this House,
over a period of many sessions, and since
the last of those occasions I have spoken in
the country at two or three events. I have
refrained
from
further
statement
here,
especially during very serious emergencies
which on at least two different occasions
have come upon us, just for fear something
I might say would make it more difficult for
the Government to take the right and proper
course. It was my sincere desire to contribute as best I could-and I thought in
late months I could do it best by silence-to
the formulation of sound policy on this
critical and momentous subject.
I speak to-day only because I am eager
to record my appreciation of the address delivered yesterday by the honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff).
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That address
rev-ealed him to me in a light which I always
thought he was entitled to enjoy-as a British
subject in thought and in heart, a man who
understands the advantages, and the obligations as well, entailed by our membership in
this Empire. The honourable senator from
Lunenburg rev ealed to me that on this, the
biggest of all questions, his heart is true; bis
mind comes to its conclusions not under
motive of prejudice or fear, nor under the
influence of a desire for immediate pleasure
and comfort, but rather, after taking a longdistance view of the true interests of bis
country, in the light of common sense.
I was indeed pleased to hear him say that
our mere aversion to war cannot of itself

MAY 11, 1939
determine our specifie course. Our determination has to be governed by factors
beyond our control. Aversion to war may be
a virtue, and if so it is one virtue we ail
possess; but it gets us nowbere in the determination of what we must do if war cornes-war of a nature and magnitude to affect us.
I was glad also to hear the bonourable
gentleman say that he believed it foolish at
this time for us, or for anybody, to say,
"Thus far we will go and no farther." War is
flot a luxury. It is not, as some people seem
to conceive, a species of indulgence in whichit is forgivable to engage, provided we participate only to the extent of our means.
Such is not the, nature of war. I like the
.spirit of a man who says there is no war
worth entering upon which is not worth fighting out to the last ditch.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was also
cheering to hear him say, "We cannot assume
to ourselves any exclusive virtue because we
are haters of war"; to hear him acknowledge
that Great Britain is .1ust as anxious to avoid
eonflict of the character that hangs over -us
now as it is possible for any people in this
world to be. I doubt not, and I acknowledge
with absolute sincerity. that France is equally
anxious with Great Britain, and that both
are ready to go the same lengtb, whicb is the
whole length of bonour and the right of survival, in avoiding the horrors of a confliet.
The honourable senator from Lunenburg
can pound and pummel me ail he likes for
isolated statements I have made, but when
he shows the kind of spirit be showed yesterday I will not only forgive him. but will
look him in the eye and honour him.
Some Hon. SENATORS: ilear, bear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is one
phase of ýhis address I may mention, but only
to the extent of a few sentences. He complained of lack of depfene preparation until
very recent ýtimes, since when, in his view,
preparation has been accelerated. That there
was a lack, I quite confess. In the light
of to-day we could not justify the lassitude
of a few years ago. That I also admit. We
rested then. witb the approval of alI sections
of our country, as Britain rested, and as in
Iess degree France rested, on wbat we thougbt
was the stre'ngth of a security inherent in
a League of Nations. We have been forced
reluctantly to accept the conclusion tbhat we
leaned upon a reed; that that league, without those cemienting covenants whicb are so
vital, bereft of the strong arm of great
powers wbo remained without, bas proved a
71498--241

-362

phantom as a preventive of war. But we in
Canada have no rigbt to complain, no right
to point to any other land as contributing
to the failure of the League of Nations. No
Lague of Nations can be of value for the
major purpose for wbicb it was conceived
without a certain sbaring of sovereignty by ite
member powers, without a certain mutuality
of obligation, extending even to the use of
armed f.orce. To maintain those very things
in the League we contributed nothing at all.
This country worked for their elimination,
and any trace of them in the covenants of
the League it did its part to disown. A
League of Nations, a worth-while League of
Nations, witbout commitments? 0f tbat very
tbing we boasted for ylears, and idly, leisurely,
we strolled along. Where, where is that League
now? A British Empire, a wortb-while British
Empire, without commitments? 0f that we
are making boast to-day. One wonders if
the time bas not coma wben we had better
look forward into the future and begin to
think.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon, W. A. GR'IESBACH: Honourable
sanators, if no one else intends to speak on
this matter, I wiIl avail mysaîf of the privilege
of closing the dabate.
The point I want to empbasize in closing
this discussion is that the need for rearmament wa.s apparent in 1935 and was at its
peak in 1936. Our knowledge. of that fact
could have been based upon 'the developments occurring in Europe. There was no
escape from the information conveyed to us in
1935 and the beginning of 1936, that Britain
was engagad in a great program of rearmament in order to cope witb the situation then
existing. Consequently we have had some three
years in which to undertake a policy of
rearmament.
It was obvious from the beginning that it
xvas only fromn Great Britain or from our
own industries and resources that we might
gat the equipmant we requirad. Perhaps I
should point out that, in the process of reequipping, standardization of equipment is one
of the most important objeets to be attained.
It permits of manufacture in every part of
the Empire, and of the closest co-operation.
Without standardization it is very difficoît to
co-operate in a military way.
As I say, it was clear that we must get
our equipment eitber from Great Britain or
from our own resources. We could not get
it from Great Britain, for the simple reason
that she was engaged in a great program
of production for ber own purposes and for
a considerabla period of ýtime could have
nothing to sell, lend, or give us. So, as far

orders for the munitions we require in this
country, as well as by co-operating to get
orders from the British Government placed
over here.
Now I come to discuss the Government's
policy in this particualr matter, so far as it
can be learned. I draw attention of honourable members to an incident that occurred
at the end of last session. When the British
Government sought to establish air training
centres in Canada, our Government refused
to grant permission, on the ground that it
was inconsistent with Canada's sovereignty
that there should exist here the armed
forces of another state. At page 4892 of the
unrevised edition of the House of Commons
Debates for last year the Right Honourable
the Prime Minister is quoted as saying:
May I say a word with respect to the idea
of having the Imperial Air Force set up flying
schools in Canada to train their pilots; in short,
a military station put down in Canada, owned,
maintained and operated by the Imperial Government for Imperial purposes. I must say that
long ago Canadian governments finally settled
the constitutional principle that in Canadian
territory there could be no military establishments unless they were owned, maintained and
controlled by the Canadian Government responsible to the Canadian Parliament and people.
There was a declaration of refusal to cooperate with respect to a very important proposal which would have had far-reaching consequences, not only upon the training of Air
Force men, but also in the matter of the
supplying of equipment. I dealt with that
the other day when I opened this discussion.
It is a declaration of policy by the Prime

Minister in the matter of co-operation with
the British Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You will find that
a few years 'ago we passed an Act-I have

thought of it just at this moment-providing for the control by our own military
authorities of any forces that happen to
visit us from another country. That would
have amply taken care of any situation of the
kind visualized by the Prime Minister. His
statement was a declaration of policy with

respect to the proposal to train Imperial
Air Force pilots in this country. I will give
another exampleHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would remind
my honourable friend that in the discussion
to which he has alluded the Right Honourable Mr. Bennett was asked a question to
this effect: "Would you be in favour of the
training on Canadian soil of a regiment outside the jurisdiction and authority of the
Canadian Government?" And, he said "No."
Hon. Mr. KING: Certainly he said "No."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not remember that question arising.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is there.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then Mr. Bennett
had forgotten that legislation which I have
just referred to. It has to do with visiting
troops, and it makes provision for the control
of them.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It would be for

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. Legislation
of the same kind was passed concurrently in
all parts of the British Commonwealth, to
provide that if troops from one part of the
Empire visit another part they shall be under
the jurisdiction of the country visited. If
Australian troops came to Canada and we
had no such law, it might be argued that
we had no control over them. But that
statute would put them under Canadian
military regulations. If any member of the
visiting force deserted here, for example, lie
could be disciplined and punished under our
own regulations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Honourable the Prime Minister wanted the
sane provision to apply to British airmen.
Hon. Mr. KING: And that is all he asked.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not follow
that. I think my honourable friends miss
the point. I am dealing now with the Governrnent's refusal tc co-operate generally in
the establishment of an armament industry in
Canada.
On June 10 of last year Mr. Woodsworth
called attention in another place to a newspaper report that United Kingdom war orders
to the amount of $200,000,000 were being given

366

SENATE

to various Canadian industries, and he asked
the Prime Minister:
Are the arrangements with regard to these
orders for munitions made direct with the
industries? Are they made with the sanction
of the Canadian Government, and does the
program commit Canada to any supplementary
or complementary arrangements?
The Prime Minister referred the question to
the Minister of National Defence, who, in
the Prime Minister's presence, answered:
I wish to assure him (Mr. Woodsworth) at
once that the Department of National Defence
has played no part either directly or indirectly
in these negotiations.
I am quoting from page 4016 of the unrevised
edition of House of Commons Debates for
last year.
On page 17 of the report of the Royal
Commission on the Bren Machine Gun Contract there is quoted a letter of August 24,
1936, from Mr. Plaxton to the Prime Minister,
inquiring whether the Government's policy
permits of the obtaining of orders for munitions from the British Government.
The
Prime Minister's reply, dated September 12,
is quoted on the same page. In it he said:
It would be necessary, of course, to see that
it was distinctly understood that such orders
as were obtained were at the instance of the
firm itself, and not, either directly or indirectly,
at the instance of the Government of Canada.
So it has been laid down again and again
that the Canadian Government have taken a
decided stand upon this matter of armaments,
a stand which, I suggest, they must reverse
if we are to have an armament industry in
this country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not understand the application of that statement which
the honourable gentleman quoted from the
Prime Minister's letter.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am trying to
bring out the fact that the policy of the
Canadian Government has been a refusal to
co-operate in the building up of an armament
industry in this country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
be told what the Government have done to
the contrary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will read that letter in its proper
sequence in the correspondence, he will find
that the Government of Canada did not want
to be bound as guaranteeing anything to
any private individual from Great Britain
who might come to Canada to establish an
industry or place an order.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Of course, the
amusing part of the story is this, that while
the Prime Minister laid that down as the
Government's policy, somebody else had a
different view, and finally that person became
an accredited representative of this Government at the War Office.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend is discussing
contract.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Now my honthe Bren gun
Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would suggest
that he suspend discussion of that matter
until the inquiry now going on in another
place is concluded. I may tell him that I
do not know the first thing about it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If we wait until
the matter is settled there we shall never hear
very much about it.
Hon. Mr. KI'NG:
I think that is true,
because we know what the object of that
inquiry is. It is not to assist in building up
armaments in this country, but to make it
impossible to develop any armament policy
here.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Let us not
discuss points that tend to divide the country,
but concentrate upon ideas that may help to
unite it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not intend
to sit idly by while this country is urged to
unite on a policy which gets nowhere. I am
attracted less by proposals for unity than by
proposals for action.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not intend
to sit back merely beceause such and such
a proposal will make for unity. What I want
is action.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
unity of action.

Well, I say,

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: One thing at a
time. As to the Bren gun, what is it going
to cost Canada?
I say that three or four
years ago, before the armament race started,
the Skoda works built that gun-I am speaking of it merely as a piece of fabricated
steel-for the Czechoslovakian army at a
price of $100, plus $15 royalty. The estimates
for the cost of that gun under the contract
signed by the Canadian Government run
from $525 to $1,305, though in no case is the
estinate reliable.

MAY 11, 1939

Hon. Mr. KING: Does my honourable
friend presume to know more about that gun
than the Enfield people, who are manufacturing it for the British Government?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You were the first
to mention the Bren gun.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, I do flot
presume that at ail. I was comparing the
price before the armament race started with
present estimated prices. Iu the course of
remarks I made a littie while ago I pointed
out that when a country undertakes to rearm
in the face of a crisis, such as exists now, it
has to psy three or four times what munitions
are worth. There is no escape from that situation. I have argued for years that we should
be preparing ourselves. 1 also said the other
day that if you try to improvise an army
in the face of a crisis there are certain inevitable consequences. One is that you canflot obtain first--class equipment; another is
that for the equipment you do get you will
pay three or four times its value, and a third
is that you wiIl flot be able to give proper
training to your officers and other army personnel, and, as a resuit, if you are engaged
in actual hostilities your casualties will be
probably three times as heavy as if you had
been prepared. There is no escape from these
things. The whole history of war teaches
that. For years I have been calling attention
to these facts; so, naturally, I am not surprised that we have to pay a lot of money
for munitions we buy now. The only thing
I should like to know is what the Bren gun
is actually going to cost, but nobody eau tell
me that.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. The record
will show you mentioned At before the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) or the
honourable senator from Kootenay Est (Hou.
Mr'. Kiug) had, spoken.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wheu my honourable friend is through I shall present to
the Huse a statement showing that Canada
is paying less for the Bren gun than Great
Britain is.
Hon. Mr'. GRIESBAGH: 1 would not believe that statement if 1 saw it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will go and
get it. I did flot raîse this Bren gun
discussion.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 know my honourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
is sincere, but does be think he is doing a
service iu discussing this question, which
has been before a royal commission and is
now under stucly by a comnmittee in another
place.?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I did flot raise the
matter to-day.
Hon. Mr'. KING: Oh, yes, you did, and very
improîperly,, I think.
Hon. Mr'. GRIESBACH: I did not raise it.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No.

Hon. Mr'. GRIESBACH: One person at a
time. Which one wishes me to reply? Which
is first?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: One gun at a time.
Hon. Mr'. KING: I want an answer to my
question.
Hon. Mr'. MURDOCH: Does the honourable member not know that the gentleman
who started the Bren, gun controversy got
what he desired? He got the leadership of
the honourable senator's party in Ontario.
Hon. Mr'. GRIESBACH: I do flot interest
myseif in that side of the question at aIl. I
am discussing the establishment of an armament industry in Canada.
Hon. Mr'. KING: But my question was a
very simple one. I will put it again: Does my
honourable friend think he is doing a gond
service to the development of an armament
industry in Canada by reviewing the Bren
contract at this time?
Hon. Mr'. GRIESBACH: I have not raised
the Bren gun contract except in answer to a
question.
Hon. Mr'. MURDOOR: 1 am sorry to say
that is not so. The honourable member
started discussing the Bren gun contract before
either of these two gentlemen rose to their
feet.
Hon. Mr'. GRIESB-ACH: I d-id flot as a
matter of fact, but, even if I did, I will answer
the honourable gentleman's question. I cannot answer what may be running in the mind of
the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdiock); it might be anything. I will
deal with this one point, which I think is
important, that no useful purpose is served
by -raising this question at the present time.
The honourable leader of the Goverument
has said that we were -united in some fashion.
Let me repeat that my admiration for the
conception of unity is by no means so great
as to cause me to accept a unity which in my
judgment is wrong. What is more important
is that we should get somewhere.« If this
country is tinited in a do-nothing polîcy, we
shail neyer get anywhere with rearmament.

368

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KING: That is no answer to
my question.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is the only
answer I have. I think the honourable gentleman is wasting my time and his own.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about yourself?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I know what I am
doing and where I a.m going. I need not say
that the honourable gentlemen are greatly
disturbed, despite the fact that they are not
quite capable of discussing this matter.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am not so sure. They
are just as able to discuss it as is the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not know
very much more about this subject than the
ordinary layman does. but I have made a
general study of armaments incidentally to
my other studies.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would confine myself
to that, then.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable friend from Edmonton now permit me
to repeat to my leader a statement which
was made during his absence? The honourable senator from Edmonton stated that you
and the honourable senator from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King) first referred to the
Bren gun question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not. I
heard a contention with respect to the Bren
gun. My honourable friend was discussing the
cost of the armament policy of this Government, and I suggested that lie should suspend
his remarks as to the Bren gun. That was the
extent of my intervention. If he will allow
me, I will give him a statement from the
Minister of National Defence on the cost of
the Bren gun to Canada, as compared with its
cost to Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: First let me complete what I have to say. Who started the
Bren gun controversy is about as important
as last year's bird's nest.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am willing ta
discuss the Bren gun so far as I know it, but
I have no desire to bring it into this discussion, to trail off into something wholly useless.
Hon. Mr. KING: Like his own speech.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I cannot remember the precise words thatHon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is just as you
said of me: you do not know what is in your
own mind.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am speaking to
a certain point. I say there ought to be an
armament industry in this country, and unless
the Government change their policy there
cannot be an armament industry here, and
consequently there will be no rearmament. I
am interested in rearmament, and I find myself face to face with the necessity of Canada
building up an armament industry. From the
quotations from speeches made in the other
House, which I have placed on Hansard, it
is evident that there is no intention on the
part of the Government to establish an armament industry in this country. The making
of a contract for the manufacture of Bren
guns is a mere incident. Against that must
be placed the fact that according to the statement of the Minister of National Defence an
order for $60,000,000 worth of essential war
equipment bas been filed with the British
War Office-an order which, at best, cannot
be filled for several years. I am all in favour
of the establishment of the Bren gun factory,
and it would have pleased me very much if
there had been no political discussion with
respect to it.
But if such discussion is
necessary, let us have it. I should like to
know what the gun will cost.
Hon. Mr. KING: That can be ascertained
only when the gun is manufactured, and the
honourable gentleman knows it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Allow me to finish
my remarks. I submit that at the outset it is
very much more important to lay down
sound principles and build upon a firm foundation. If rascality, undue profit or political
interference can be established in regard to
the Bren gun transaction, then whoever
started the discussion did a service to Canada.
I am ready to deal with the question if its
further discussion will be to the national
advantage. I have not discussed the matter
except to say that the only outcome of what
is asserted to be the first attempt to establish
an armament industry bas been a political
scandal. I do not approve of that, and it
should be stopped. What nay come out of
the inquiry I do not know.
I repeat. unless there is a change of policy
on the part of the Government we shall not
have an arniament industry in this country,
and it must follow that we shall have no
armaments. It is manifest fron what I have
read, indeed it is what everybody knows, that
the Government are deliberately steering clear
of co-operation with the British Government
on a policy of rearmament.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think so.

MAY 11, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is selfevident. We have already heard that there
is to be no0 co-operation in the business of
rearmameat because of the charges that have
been made against the armament industry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend bas stated that the. policy of the
Government is against any kind of co-operation with the British Government. I do not
wish to engage in the Bren gun controversy,
but in order to answer my honourable friend
I would draw bis attention to the statement
which I have in my hand concerning the cost
of the Bren gun and how its production is
being proceeded with j ointly with the order
from. the British Government. It reads:
The contract between the Canadian Government and John Inglis Company Limited provided that the Canadian Governm'ent, once
production commences, pay actual costs plus a
limited profit for guns and spare parts produced
for it. The contract between the Government
of the United Kingdom. and John Inglis Co.
Ltd. likewise provides that the Goverament of
the United Kingdom will pay actual costs plus
a limited profit for the articles manufactured
for their account. The Canadian contract is
for 7,000 guns and a number of spare parts;
the Goverament of the United Kingdom have
ordered 5,000 guns.
Taking into consideration the f act that the
Government of the United Kingdom pay onethird of the capital cost of maehinery, tools,
dies, jigs and preparatory overhead and that
such equipment se purchased will remain the
property of the Canadian Government and will
have a considerahle value to the owners at the
termination of the contract, it follows that the
net cost per unit will be less to the Canadian
Government than to that of the United Kingdom.
I cite that only to show there is very close
co-operation between the Government of
Canada and the British Governmnent with
respect to the manufacture of the Bren gun
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And the profit
mentioned is at the expense of the British
taxpayer.
Hlon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: The British taxpayer, 1 think, is well protected. by the British
Government. I arn not concerned with his
interest; it is nlot in my hands. I arn looking
to the ioterest of the Canadian taxpayer.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The very favourable construction wbich the honourable gentleman puts on the memorandum. is not borne
out by what I have read in the English newspapers. True the Bren gun is being manufactured in Canada, but I would direct my
honourable friend's attention to the fact that,
contrary to the wishes of the Prime Minister,
as expressed in this memorandum, bis officiaIs
did bring about that co-operation--did do the
very tbing wbich he said they must not do.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
No, nothing of
the kind. Read that letter of 1936 again.
Hon. Mr. GRJESBACH: I will oblige the
honourable gentleman. This is the letter of
the Prime Minister which I have already
cited:
I may say, in reply, that we see no reason
why a Canadian firmn established for the manufacture of munitions should be precluded f rom
obtaining orders from the British Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr.
stronig stuif.

GRIESBACH:

That is good.
That

is

fine,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wonder why
that was worth saying.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The letter continues:
It would be necessary, of course, to see that
it was distinctly understood that such orders
as were obtained were at the instance of the
firm. itself and not, either directly or indirectly,
at the instance of the Government of Canada.
If my bonourable friend boasts of the close
co-operation that now exists between the
British and Canadian
Governments with
respect to the Bren gun contracts, such cooperation as does exist, as the commissioner
said, exists contrary to the views of the Prime
Minister as expressed at that time.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Co-operatian . had
nothing whatever to do with it. It was a
letter of introduction stating merely that the
person who was going over to England was
the representative of the Canadian Government. It was given just as any letter of introduction would be given under similar circumstances.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The fact that
Major Hahn was made an emissary of the
Canadian Government ta the War Office canflot be denied. That co-operation my hionourable friend regards as being a wonderful
accomplishment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: WelI, such as it
is, it is in contravention of the Prime Minister's own declared policy and bis express instructions. It is a mere accident to have
the co-operation referred to. However, putting
it at its best, I accept it. But it is not a
splendid start. It is a mere drop in the
hucket; no more.
Hon. Mr. KING:

But one drop.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We shahl neyer
bave an armament industry in this country
until the Governmeiit change their policy
and enter into the closest negotiations with
the British Govýernment to estahlish such an

SENATE

370

industry by inviting British industrialists to
undertake it here, or by inducing our own
people to take it up.

Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable gentleman should advise the British Navy not to
hand over that destroyer.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That does not
sound like a very wise observation.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There cannot be
any rearmament until that is done. There is
no escape from that conclusion.
That is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
opinion of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No; he will find
it the opinion of many other persons. There
is good reason for that widely entertained
opinion. The policy of the Government is
rooted in the expression, "rearmament for the
defence of Canada alone." Then you have
the point raised by the leaders of the C. C. F.
and others sharing their views, that if there
is co-operation with Great Britain in the
establishment of an armament industry in
Canada, commitments will thereby be implied,
and so this Government will make no commitments. It follows that there will be no
armament industry. This conclusion can be
arrived at by a dozen avenues, and there is
no escape from ilt.
I am urging now that the situation has
developed to the point where the Government must face the issue and change their
policy. I have not much hope of influencing
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) but I would impress upon him
that it is imperatively necessary that the
Government change their policy.
I pass to another aspect of the Government's refusal to co-operate with the British
Government. Let me give a few examples
of what the British Government are doing
for us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

For us?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: For us. At this
moment the British Navy is short of destroyers to the extent of more than 100, and
yet in the last year has sold us two destroyers
at a price below cost. We are now applying
for a flotilla leader, which may be described
as a large destroyer or small cruiser. The
Minister of National Defence assures us that
he hopes to get the flotilla leader in the near
future.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, the
Canadian Government would purchase it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, but it will
be purchased below cost. They are asking
the British Government to hand over a flotilla
leader when the Royal Navy needs more than
100 destroyers. We do not seem to mind that
at all.
lon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend says that you should advise the British
Navy not to hand over that destroyer to us.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Neither is that
a very wise observation, nor is it germane to
the question. As I say, the British Navy is
in urgent need of more than 100 destroyers,
but because Canada represented that our navy
required two destroyers the British Navy
supplied us with them, and is about to let
us have a flotilla leader.
Hon. Mr. KING:
operation.

That

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

might

be

co-

Yes, that is co-

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: On the part of
Britain.
Hon. Mr. KING: On the part of both.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
nonsense.

Both!

Don't talk

Now, though they are in the midst of their
rearmament program in Great Britain, and,
as we know, wili for a considerable time be
short of equipment for the increased personnel
resulting fron the introduction of conscrip.
tion and the doubling of their territorial army,
the Minister of National Defence has unioaded on the British Government an order
for $60,000,000 worth of equipment, which is
essential if we are to conduet our defence
ai all. I suppose the British Government have
accepted that load, too. At all events, we
do not seem to hesitate to ask the Imperial
authorities to hand over that equipment.
The Minister of National Defence said
that for protection we rely upon the British
Navy. He neither qualified nor explained
his statement; he simply gave it as a statement of fact. He also said that we rely
upon the American Navy for our defence.
I would advise him to go slow. The Americans are not so used to our-shall J say?gaucherie, and they may send us a bill.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Why shouldn't they?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They may some
day exert pressure on us and say, "According to your Minister of National Defence we
have been protecting you for so many years,
and it is time you did something for us."
I suggest that the honourable leader of the
Government whisper that into the ear of the
Minister.

MAY 11, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a very
broad question.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes; but it does
not seem to bother us at all.
Let me cite another instance of what we
get from the Imperial authorities. The diplomatic and consular services of Great Britain
have been at our disposal for years. When
a Canadian is abroad he avails himself of
the services of the nearest British consul.
We pay the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cost of that service.
We pay the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
cost?
We pay the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cost of maintenance of the British consular
service. Whenever in any part of the world
a Canadian calls on the British consul for a
visa or other service, the British consul is
very glad to give that service and to receive
the regular fees for it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Could you give
us a statement some day of what this Government have paid for that service during the
past three years?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The individual who goes
to the British consul, whether he be the
captain of a ship or anybody else, pays for the
service.
So does the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
ordinary British subject. Those are only consular dues. The maintenance of the office,
the prestige of the whole job, the occasional
visit of a British warship, are things we
have nothing to do with at all.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Who opposed our
ambassadorial offices?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH. We have no
ambassadorial offices. We have four ministries, one each at Paris, Washington, Brussels
and Tokyo, and I did not know that, apart
from ordinary official correspondence settling
the details, there was any opposition from
anybody.
At any given moment there are 50 officers
of the Canadian Government receiving training in the British Navy. That does not cost
us a cent. There are 20 Canadian officers
receiving training in the British Army. That
does not cost us a cent. Our officers take
courses in British staff colleges and war colleges, and that does not cost us a cent.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is the form
of co-operation that is taking place.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so
too-all one way.

371

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: One way cooperation We do not do the same thing in
return.
Hon. Mr. KING: We have men from
Great Britain here now.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They are over
here in exchange. They are doing the work
of Canadian officers and learning conditions in
the country. We have officers in the Old
Country for a similar purpose. That is a
matter of exchange.
I am talking about
educational institutions which are maintained
in Great Britain, and which our people attend
free of charge.
Hon. Mr. KING: And the British authorities wish them to come.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Of course they do.
Hon. Mr. KING: Why do you try to
make something of that? You are belittling
your own country.
An Hon. SENATOR: Playing politics.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
contribution of 59,000 Canadian boys who
are sleeping in Flanders? Was that a contribution of Canada towards the assistance
of Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sively.

No, it was not.
It was, exclu-

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, it was not
at all. Canada's contribution in that war was
a contribution to a common cause, nothing
more and nothing lessSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -and any man
who takes the view that the men who served
in the Great War served merely to assist
Great Britain, as Great Britain, suggests that
we were an army of hirelings.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
hold its end?

Did Canada up-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
the common cause.

Sure;

in

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did it take its
proper share of responsibility in the war by
sending 600,000 soldiers over there, of whom
59,000 were left behind?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As a matter of
fact Canada sent only 450,000 overseas.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then the Conservative Government of the day ought to
revise their figures.

SENATE
Hon
Mr. GRIESBACH:
There were
619,000 enlisted, and 450,000 were sent overseas. That was our contribution to a common
cause. And when the contribution is examined from the point of view of costs and
casualties it will be found that, while our
contribution was a good one, it was no better
than any other.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Now I will
put a question to my honourable friend. If
Canada bad been an independent nation on
the fourth day of August, 1914, would it have
declared war on Germany because of Germany's invasion of Belgium?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: That bas nothing to do with the case.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is a hypothetical question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The United
States did not go to war because Belgium
had been invaded by the Germans, and the
South American republics did not declare war
because of that invasion. Would Canada,
being an independent nation, have declared
war on Germany on the fourth of August,
1914, because Germany had invaded Belgium?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That depends on
so many things that it is impossible to answer
off-hand.
If we bad been an independent
countryHon. Mr. MACDONELL: "If 'ifs' and
ands' were pots and pans," so to speak.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If Canada
would not have declared war on Germany
because of the invasion of Belgium, that
means that Canada did not go to war over
a question relating exclusively to Canadian
interests.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That
not follow at all.

does

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It follows absolutely. If Canada had been an independent
nation it would not have declared war on
Germany because the Germans had invaded
Belgium. That is clear. No one will deny
that affirmation. So I say that we joined in
the war through sentiment. We went to war
because of sentiment for the Mother Country,
and in so doing we were going to the aid
of Great Britain, not to defend an interest
peculiar to Canada. The interest would not
have arisen if Canada had been an independent nation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You had
better read the speech of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
at the beginning of the sessionHon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am familiar
with it. But it was not because of a special
interest that Canada went to war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Neither did
Great Britain go to war because of any special
interest. She went to war in a great cause.
It was better for the world that we should
go at once, whether we were independent or
not, and it would have been better had the
United States donc likewise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That I admit.
And if we had, been on the same plane as the
United States, and the United States had
gone to war, that would have been an invitation to us to follow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where should
we have been if the war had been lost?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say that if
Canada had been an independent country it
would not have gone to war on the fourth of
August, 1914. So, if she did go to war then,
it was because of a national sentiment in
favour of the Mother Country.
That is
where we rendered a service to Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Mr. Speaker, I rise to
a point of order. Who is making the speech
here?
Hon.

Mr. LACASSE: You are just now.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not mind
answering the question. Canada would not
have gone into the war any sooner than the
United States. We might have got into it
ultimately.
The honourable gentleman is quite right
when ho speaks of the importance of sentiment. Sentiment is one of those intangible
things which in the affairs of mankind weigh
more heavily than almost any other consideration.
One of the greatest mistakes
made by some public men is that they do
not count upon it. It is something for which
men are prepared to fight and die.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is a greater
mistake than that.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!

Order!

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is a greater
mistake than that.

MAY 11, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I shall never forget the answer Arthur Sifton made to a
question lie did not hear very well. It was,
"Largely." That may do as an answer to the
honourable gentleman's question.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Now, I want to
finish up this question of co-operation, which
we have heard something about. One of the
greatest things which the British Government
do for us in the matter of defence is to place
at our disposal the results of their policy of
experimentation and trial with regard to equipment. No other Government in the world
spend as much money in that field as Great
Britain does. Rifles, field guns, all sorts of
equipment, are tested and tried. I have seen
some of ·that work being done. A thousand
rifles are made with special machinery, and
are sent all over the world for trial, and,
when a piece of equipment is finally decided
upon you may rest assured that it is the
best of its kind. That costly service is placed
at our disposal free of charge.
My reason for raising this question of cooperation a few moments ago was that many
thousands, yes, millions of people in Canada,
would like to see a somewhat closer co-operation, based on this sentiment to which the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
has referred. We are confronted with the
policy of this Government as to the defence
of Canada alone. From that arises the situation in which we find ourselves. In other
words, we give no co-operation at all. We
accept all and expect all. We do not seem
to mind loading our troubles on Great Britain
and doing nothing in return. Our position is
not a very enviable one. This may not bother
some people who do not experience this
sentimental attachment, but I submit that the
position of the country to-day is a reversal of
the position to which our soldiers had brought
it at the close of the Great War. We have
abandoned the proud position which we gained
in the last war, as a part of the Commonwealth-a position based on the general idea
that we were willing to do our share. Our
policy and attitude to-day is a negation of
our assumption of equality in the Commonwealth. Again I am speaking from the point
of view of sentiment. I may be quite wrong,
but I fancy the majority of the people in
this country think as I do in this matter,
and would be much happier if the Government took a bolder course. The attitude of
the Government in connection with the whole
business is ungenerous and unchivalrous; in
some degree it is pusillanimous and contemptible.

373

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman say the attitude of Canada
should be such as to allow the foreign policy
of Great Britain to dictate the policy of
the Canadian Government from the first of
January to the thirty-first of December?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. That is a
worn-out proposition. We know all about that.
The control of foreign policy has been discussed and chewed over by all sorts of people.
I lived with it for a couple of months last
summer. It does not cause me the slightest
concern. I believe the Prime Minister has
told us about the control of our policy, and
so forth. But my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) raises the question of sentiment, which is perhaps the most important
factor of all. If there is anything wrong with
the foreign policy of Great Britain, I should
like to know what it is. It changes from
day to day, because foreign policies must
change from day to day. As to that policy,
it must be said that never in history has there
been so vigorous and valiant an attempt to
preserve the peace of the world as that policy
has given us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Lately.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Never in the history of the world. The British Government
have subjected themselves to criticism by
their own people, and the accusation of lack
of energy, lack of determination, lack of courage; and the Prime Minister has humiliated
himself as no other public man has ever donc;
all to gain peace.
If our policy is a policy of peace, surely
it and British policy run on parallel lines;
and if in the course of time it should become
apparent that it is impossible to trust the
dictators or deal with them. if it begins to
emerge that the peace of the world is
threatened by them, then again, I think, our
policy will agree with that of the British
Government.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Whatever it
may be?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, no. My honourable friend likes ta say that. I have
heard him say it many times. But on any
given day, in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred, the wishes, hopes and fears of the
people of this country will be found to be
more or less parallel with those of the
British people; and the policy of the Government will follow. At this precise moment
the minds of the people of this country, of
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and

374

SENATE

Great Britain, to say nothing of the other
democratie countries, are running on parallel
lines, and the policies of their governments
will manifest themselves as the policy
crystallized in Great Britain. I am as good
a Canadian as anybody, and when I find any
policy of Great Britain which does not suit
me I will say so; and after following the
British policy from day to day I say that
to-day it is satisfactory to the people of this
country.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And what is that
policy? It is that if peace cannot be maintained we will make as good a fight as we
can.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is what I
am urging now. As a Canadian I should feel
proud of my country if in this emergency we
were to show a real desire and intention to
make our contribution to the common cause,
thereby maintaining the, claim for equality
in the Commonwealth, which is, or ought to
be, our proudest boast and aspiration.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I understand that my
honourable friend from Edmonton bas closed
the debate, as it is his right to do I refrained
fron interrupting or asking questions, for the
simple reason that I thought my honourable
friend had his hands full without me. So
perhaps I may now be permitted to ask one
question. When the Great War was on, why
were the United States so late in joining in
the fight for the common cause, as he describes
it?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Ask the United
States.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What, in the opinion
of the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). prevented Uncle Sam
from joining earlier than he did the forces
figlting for the so-called common cause? My
honourable friend knows very well what did
it. There was utter lack of unity within the
boundaries of the United States. I therefore conclude that my honourable friend was
not altogether right when he said he preferred action to unity. From what happened
in the United States I should infer that unity
must precede action.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentl"man ha s pr-tty well answered his own
question. The Unitcd States did not participate in the Groat War w-han it first broke ont
because they did noi sec any occasion to do so.
Thair rights and interests were not involved.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAUH.

They immediately began to sell a great
quantity of materials to the belligerent
countries, and they made so much money that
they shifted the balance of the financial world
before they were through. But, as the war
progressed, the American people had to
change their minds. At the outset the question was, why should they go in, but in
time the question became, how could they
stay out. There is nothing remarkable about
that. Their interests were threatened, their
ships were being sunk, their coasts were in
danger. Finally they came to the conclusion
that great principles were involved in the
struggle going on in Europe, and, as the
country is a democratic one, it was inevitable
that the swing of public opinion should compel the Government to take action. There is
nothing renarkable about that. The development was a perfectly logical one.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is my honourable friend's interpretation of it. But he must
be aware that there was an utter lack of unity
in the United States because of the strong
pro-German sentiment that existed there.
That fact cannot ha ignorcd.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One would
hardly suggest that so long as any group of
persons can prevent unity a nation must ba
absolutelv silent, inactive and worthless.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see that the

Hon. DUNCAN MeL. MARSHALL moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
designed to make a sort of permanent arrangement that will require fewer sums of money
to 'be advanced annually for seed grain and
relief to farmers who have had croýp failures.
Everybody who knows the West is aware that
for more than fifty years assistance bas been
given annually to some of the farmers in the
Prairie Provinces. In tbe old days, thirty-five
or forty years ago. money was advanced by
the provincial governments or guaranteed by
them to the municipalities, wbere there were
municipalities-and there were only a few
at tbat time outside of Manitoba. Repayment
of the money advanced or guaranteed in eacb
case hy the province was in turn guaranteed
to it by the Federal Governmýent. Most of
these grants which were not repaid were taken
care of by the provincial governments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Grants for
what?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: For seed grain,
where tbere bad been crop failures. Seed
grain bad to be supplied to some farmers in

375

Alberta, Saskatchewan and Man.itoba almost
every year.
The real object of this Bill is, through the
payment of grants, to enable farmers to live

contingent upon one of two tbings, which the
Bill designates as a "national emergeney,"
or a "crop failure." In tbis respect there is
said to be a national emergency when the
price of wheat drops below a certain level;
anld there is a crop failure when the average
y>eld in 100 or 135 townships in a province
ls less than a certain number of bushels.
The national emergency occurs when wheat

Wben the price is less than 80 cents at Fort
William, the Government would pay to, the
farmers wbo have a sbort crop wbat migbt
be called emergency payments, to, tide them
over the year. As everybody wbo is familiar
witb the Western survey knows, a township
consists of 36 sections. Where the average
yield in a townsbip is over eigbt bushels but
leas than twelve bushels per acre, ten cents
per acre will be paid for cach cent that
tbe price of wheat is below 80 cents. That is,
if wbeat is at 70 cents, $1 per acre will be paid
where tbe average yield is between eight
and twclve hushels to, the acre. Wbere the
average yield is above four bushels but under
eigbt bushels to the acre, $1.50 per acre will
*be paid; and wbere it is under four bushels,
the grant will be $2 per acre.
But these grants will be paid on only onebaîf of the cultivated land so cropped, and in
no case will tbey be computed on a larger
area than 200 acres, because the intention of
the Bill is, not to encourage large farming
operations, but to, assist farmers wbo are on
small holdings, on wbat migbt be called
family-sized farms, and wbo are trying to make
a living on thcm. Furtbcr, the grants will be
paid only to farmers wbo are actually occupying and working their land. That is, tbey
will not be available to professional men in
towns or cities wbo farm for their own satisfaction, or, as some people occasionally do, to be
useful to their country, or to make money.
0f course, as honourable members know, very
few people living in cities have been, opcrating
farms witb a view to making money in late
years.
As I have said, under this Bill money may
bc paid out under two circumstances: a national
einergeiiry, or a crop ýfailure. I have alrcady

gency. There is understood to be a crop
failure when 135 townships in the province of
Saskatchewan or 100 townships in either
or Manitoba have an average
Alberta
yield of five bushels or less to the
acre.
Applications
for assistance under
the Bill will have to be made through
the municipalities to the province, and then
from the province to the Federal Government.
Local conditions will likely be checked by
the municipal and provincial governments,
because they are in a position to check thei
more efficiently and at less expense than the
Federal Government are. The occupiers of
this land in a crop failure area who have a
yield of five bushels an acre or less will
be paid a sum not exceeding S2.50 an acre
up to 200 acres. That payment must be on
only one-half of their cultivated land. But
the land need not be seeded to wheat; it
may be seeded to barley, oats, flax, or any
other kind of fari crop. The intention is not
to pay on wheat alone. The payments are
in respect of crop failure caused by drought,
frost, grasshoppers or rust. Damage by bail
is excluded, for the reason that bail insurance
is available in the three Prairie Provinces.
These payments will not apply to more than
200 acres farmed by one farmer.
In order to establish a fund out of which
these awards in future years may be paid,
in whole or in part, an assessment of 1 per
cent is to be made on all grain marketed at
the local elevator. It is calculated that the
farmer who bas a good crop of grain, whether
barley, oats or wheat, ought to make some
smaili contribution to the relief of his unfortunate fellow farmer in that province who did
not have a crop at ail. It is estimated that
1 per cent this year would aggregate between
$2,000.000 and $2,500,000. This will help to
build up a compensation fund which, while it
may not be entirely self-sustaining, will at
least be partially so.
At the present time we find there is a very
active discussion in most countries of the
world in regard to what should be done to
assist the farmer. The new Minister of Agriculture in Great Britain, Sir Reginald DornanSmith, is a past president of the National
Farmers' Union of England. He was in this
city last year, when I had the pleasure, along
with a number of other senators, of listening
to him. In Great Britain he is regarded as
one of the best authorities on the farming
situation. He bas recently laid down the
principles of his policy, particularly with
respect to crop insurance. He said:
In its broadest sense, the term "price-insurance" is used as covering measures which ensure
a fair return to the producer by some form of
direct payment. Within this idea two rather
different principles are contained.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL,

First there is the idea of a "guaranteed
price." This contemplates that the fariner shall
be guaranteed by the State on all his production
a price sufficiently remunerative to ensure him
a profit when all outgoings are paid.
The implications of such a concept should be
clearly realized.
If this were granted, the
farmer would enjoy a degree of security which
Parliament has not given to any branch of
industry.
No measure of protection or assistance that
bas been given to industry, by tariff, subsidy or
otherwise, amounts to this. To give such a
guarantee would, in the present condition of
our agriculture, impose on the Exchequer a
burden which no body of taxpayers could reasonably be expected to shoulder.
To-day we in Canada are faced by a condition, to meet which it is estimated that
over $40,000,000 may be required from the
treasury as a bonus, so to speak, to the wheatgrowers of Western Canada on the basis of
80-cent wheat. As I remarked the other day,
I believe the people of Canada do not begrudge
that, because they know their fellow Canadians in that territory have suffered over a
period of years as no other section of our
people bave suffered. But tiere is no doubt
thjat as three-quarters of our population are
not engaged in raising wheat, there will come
a time when they will not be willing to put
anything like that amount of noney to bonus
our whe'at growers.
Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, whom I mentioned before, when stating his agricultural
poliry before the British House of Commons,
said:
The general aim of the policy would be to
create and maintain conditions which will
enable those engaged in the industrythat is, agriculture-to obtain at least a reasonable livelihood by
efficient production and marketing, and to farm
the land to the best advantage; and so to ensure
the maintenance of the productivity of the land
and the improvement of its fertility.
Then lie proceeded:
With regard to tariffs, there was the objection
That
that they "taxed" the people's food.
objection was not in itself an insuperable one,
but a further difficulty was placed in the way
of tariff protection by the international engagements into which this country had entered.
By that he means such treaties as Britain bas
made with Canada and the United States.
Under our trade treaty with Great Britain
we export large quantities of fara produce,
particularly bacon, beef and wheat. He is
prepared to sup)port British agriculture in such
a way that the farmer will bc enabled to
make a decent livelihood, but ho does not
pretend that such support will give the farmer
a profit.
We brar a good deal about the cost of
raising w heat and producing butter and cheese.
I think nobody can give any but approximate

MAY 11, 1939
figures as to such cost, for the simple reason
that there is a great variety of farming, and
many of those engaged in it are not very
competent. In other words, they should not
be farming at all, as they have neither the
taste nor the ability to do the job as it should
be done. Consequently no Government can
figure on making farming a profitable business
for all engaged in it.
That being the case, the purpose of this Bill
is that the farmer who has a good crop shall
contribute something towards bis fellow
farmer who bas had the misfortune of a crop
failure, in order that out of this common fund
and out of funds added to it by the Government he shall receive sufficient to enable him
to carry on. Sixty per cent of this assistance
will be paid in December and 40 per cent in
March, in the expectation that the December
payment will help the farmer and his family
through the winter and the March payment
will enable him to purchase the necessary
seed grain for the following year.
It is argued by some persons that large
tariff reductions on the commodities which
the farmer has to buy would be the easiest
way of compensating him. But we know it
is very difficult to reduce tariffs. I remember reading, when I was a boy, a speech
delivered in Glasgow by the late Earl Rosebery, and I have never forgotten his reference
to tariffs. At that time the subject of protection was under discussion in Britain, and,
referring to it, he said it was often remarked
that March came in like a lanb and went out
like a lion; but protection came in like a lamb,
grew like a lion, and never went out at all. I
do not think there is any doubt about the
correctness of that statement
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: We all know that
once protection is given to certain industries
they are able to show in one way or another
that they cannot continue if any part of it
is taken away.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are first
helped as infant industries, but they always
remain in infancy.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: My right honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) at one time stated in the House
of Commons that if the industries had remained infants he would have a good deal
of sympathy for them, but he thought they
had grown considerably at that time.
I think we are forced now to this position,
that if everybody else is to be protected,
and the farmer cannot be protected, we
should at least stand between him and the
calamities that beset him on the prairies of
Western Canada. If we get a few good cron

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: It is an annual
tax, no matter whether there is an emergency
or not?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes. The tax
is 1 per cent on all grain delivered at
elevators. This in one particular will suit
my honourable friend from Marquette (Hon.
Mr. Mullins), because the man who -feeds
his grain will not pay this tax. It is only
when he markets his grain at the elevator that
he as to pay the 1 per cent. This is quite
equitable, for he is taking so much fertility
out of the soil and putting it on the market,
and therefore ought to make some contribution to help his unfortunate brother farmer
who that year has a crop failure.
I intend to move, when this Bill bas been
given second reading, that it be referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
where each clause can be gone into thoroughly. I do not wish to delay the House
any longer, and therefore I now move that
the Bill be given second reading.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, my chief objection to this Bill is that
it gives a bonus to the poor farming districts
of the West.
It is difficult to discuss this measure without
at the same time discussing a sister bill which
the Minister of Trade and Commerce bas
introduced in the Commons, but which bas
not yet reached this House. I refer to the
bill to fix the price of wheat at 70 cents a
bushel.
Now, let me put the House straight. This
Bill really bas nothing to do with bonusing
agriculture. The underlying principle of the
Bill is to place a 1 per cent tax on all grain
delivered at the elevator, so that over a period
of years a fund will be built up to take care
of the payments to be made under the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tunate ones.

To the unfor-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is to become effective
on the first of August, 1939. To judge from
the reports I get from the West, conditions
are not good, and this is going to be an
emergency year. True, there is as yet no
money in the fund, but in time payments
will be met from the collections under the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

But will they?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If there had been such
a tax in the three Prairie Provinces during the
last forty years, the fund would probably be
sufficient, because in that period we had the
high prices of the war years, and the 1915
crop, which was the biggest in the history of
Canada. However, I am criticizing the Bill,
not from that standpbint, but rather on the
ground that it taxes the good farms for the
benefit of the poor farms.
Now I am going to say something that I
could not say if I were running for election.
Nevertheless it is a fact. There is a large
area in southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan . and a corner of Manitoba, where the
people can never make a living off the land.
Seventy years ago, when the Dominion Government sent out an expedition to look over
the country in connection with the building of
the Canadian Pacific Railway, it was reported
that the Great Desert of America extended up
into that country. I can remember men
coming down from there to the province of
Ontario in 1892 and telling my father that
the land would net produce anything; that
they were starved out. Yet that country is
being farmed to-day.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS:

Hon. Mr. HAIG: This Bill will result in
a constant struggle by the people there to
keep that land under cultivation, and the
Government will be called upon from time to
time to help out.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
put those people?

Where would yeu

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It would be cheaper to
move thern out altogether and take them to
northern Alberta, northern Saskatchewan or
northern Manitoba, where such conditions do
net exist. I have seen that country. I have
seen the grasshoppers, the drought and the
rust. Truc, the land south from Moose Jaw
and south from Swift Current is very fertile,
but there is not sufficient rainfall year by
year to make farming pay. The only thing
you can really grow there is wheat. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) knows
that while there is wheat-growing land south
of Letbbridge it will not grow grass. The
old buffalo grass is all gone.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Is it net a fact
that in good years the very best wheat is
grown in those areas?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit that freely. I
admit that No. 1 Hard can be grown in
southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and
soutiern Manitoba when there is rainfall.
But this Bill vill simply keep people on
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

poor land. I want to say candidly that I
think the Government are making a mistake,
although I would not for a moment oppose
the Bill unless our whole policy were changed
and these farmers were moved. Take the
area betwen Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba: I do net believe that in the last twenty
years the farmers there have had more than
one crop which yielded above twelve bushels
to the acre. Frequently the yield is only five
or six bushels. They will come under this
Bill, and will remain there. That is what I
object to. The insurance feature of the Bill
is good, but I am persuaded that it will be
of no use.
I want to warn honourable members that
Western Canada does net accept this Bill as
a substitute for a guaranteed price on wheat.
The committee of representatives of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, headed by the
Premier of Manitoba, rejected this Bill in
toto as a substitute for the guaranteed price
of grain. They say they will accept the
Bill, but that it must not be regarded as an
answx'er to the demand of Western Canada
for some support in the crisis through whicb
it is passing.

The farniers of our three provinces are
facing as serionus a crisis as has ever been
known in this country, and it is not of their
own making. Truc, in days gone by, many
of then may have been extravagant; but that
is not what we are dealing with here. Dunring
my boyhood on a farm in Manitoba, and until
I grew up-in fact, until about 1929-I never
suspected that it would be impossible to sell
wheat. I thought you might be unable to sel
gold, but not wheat. It was a terrible thing
for Westerners te realize in 1929 that maybe
wheat could not be sold. Many men condemn
the late Government for their management of
the wheat question. Ultimately they came
out with a profit. But I am net going into
that matter. I am persuaded that when Mr.
Bennett and his Government adopted their
wheat policy they never dreamed that perhaps ultimately it would be impossible to
make sales. And now, as we all know, we
have reached the stage when some of our
wheat cannot be sold, because the great consuming countries are producing to meet their
own requirements. From 75 to 80 per cent of
our production cannot now be used in this
country. I am persuaded that the time is
coming when, because of economie conditions,
our own people will have te pay a very much
higher price than they have ever paid for
Canadian grain, and we shall have to spend
large sums of money in finding new uses for
wheat.
Ultinately a measure like this will be of
no use, because the farmers who are intended

MAY 11, 1939
to be covered by it will have to move off
their present land onto land where they can
engage in diversified production. I do not
always agree with my honourable friend frorm
Marquette (Hon. Mr. Mullins), but in his
arguments about cattle he may be right. I
know that in those parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta where diversified farming
is carried on, the struggle during these bad
years has been withstood better than in other
parts of the province.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: That supports my
argument.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not want to take up
any more time on this measure, but I wish
to notify the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that I intend to speak at greater
length when we receive the other wheat bill
which we are expecting. I am in favour of
this measure, though it does not answer our
demands, nor will it help to remedy the
existing situation in a fundamental way. It
may tide over an emergency. I can understand why honourable gentlemen who in another place represent the constituencies of
Souris, Weyburn, Assiniboia, Wood Mountain,
Lethbridge. and other southern parts of these
provinces would be in favour of the measure.
Those parts will benefit from it, but other
sections of the provinces will have to pay for
it ultimately.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
"Help thy
neighbour."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I were sure the measure
would permanently help him, I should be
more in favour of it. But I do not think it
is any good to keep him in a state of poverty
for ever.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Surely to
move these people from the land they now
occupy to better sections would not cost any
more than the $40,000,000 or $50,000,000 which
we shall have to pay out every year under
this measure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want to be fair to the
present Government. I want honourable
members to understand the way that the
Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of
Finance would naturally look at the situation.
We in Western Canada have always hoped that
the lack of moisture in certain sections was a
temporary condition, and that the cycle - of
better years would return. So far it has not
come back. Ultimately we must face the
problern of moving the farmers from those
dried-out areas. I think that if the Bennett
Government had faced that problem in 1931
the country would be better off to-day. But,

mind you, I am not blaming the Bennett
Government, because I myself did not foresee,
nor do I believe anybody could have foreseen,
the desolation that has stricken parts of
southern Saskatchewan and Alberta. In that
part of Alberta where my honourable friend
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) lives
there is an irrigation system. I went through
there two years ago, and it is a paradise,
producing 60 and 65 bushels to the acre. But
within five miles of that district nothing at
all grows--nothing but weeds blowing in the
wind. It is my opinion that if present conditions continue it will be much cheaper to move
all the people affected than to provide for
them as under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I should not like
my honourable friend to lead people to
believe that the irrigated areas are producing
too much wheat.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The people there
are getting out of wheat into other things.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a word or two with
reference to the dry district which the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) mentioned. Thirty-four years ago I
spent a considerable time in that section, and
drove over it in a buckboard. That happened
to be a fairly dry year. I am not exaggerating
when I say that if you worked all day you
could not pull grass enough to fIl your hat.
There is no doubt that from a long-range
point of view it would be in the best interest
of those people, and less expensive than the
plan we are now following, to move them to
better sections in the West. I made that
statement in this House some years ago, for
I recall that telegrams, far from complimentary, were sent to me by business people
located in villages out in those areas.
That part of the. country has been dry for
seventy years. It should have been allowed to
remain as cattle ranches, but unfortunately it
has been broken up, and nobody knows how
long it will take for the buffalo grass to come
back, if it ever does. Undoubtedly we are
faced with the alternative of continuing to
give support to the people in that section or
moving thern to northern parts of the provinces, where there is undoubtedly land on
which they can work out a living.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, perhaps I have had as long an
experience in the West as most men. The
whole area mentioned by the honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.

380

SENATE

Haig) was originally nothing but ranching
country. Around Lethbridge and west to the
mountains it is rich and fertile, but in other
sections, where the heavy Chinook came,
the land bas neyer been suitable for growing
grain. I would refer hanourable members to
Mr. John W. Dafoe's book on Clifford Sif ton,
where he states distinctly that that neyer was
a farming country. I was engaged in ranching
there, and I had to give Up. I Jet go 20,000
acres soutb of Medicine Hiat. It is bard to
describe the effect of the very hot winds out
there. You might get a littie moisture, and,
as a resuit, have a small quantity of grain
growing, but the whole thiog would sometimes
disappear in three or four days.
We threw up both hands and gave this
]and away to people. We said, "Here is a
rich, fertile area, fertilized by the buffalo."
But, despite all its richness, you cannot grow
a crop without rain It is true that once
every ten or fifteen years you may get a
heavy rain and then anything will grow.
You could put your walkiog cane into the
ground and it would sprout. But in between
there are long dry spells, when it is impossible to raise any kind of crop at ail. So 1
agree witb the honourable junior senator from
Winnipeg that it would be wise to move the
people ont of that district.
I say again, honourable members, that the
farmer who bas flot good live stock on his
land is flot a farmer at aIl. Look at the
thousands of successful Ontario farms. Look
at the farms down along tbe St. Lawrence,
where the old habitant, before he dies, wills
what is called a oever-dying- caw ta be kept
on in the familyv.
1 arn not talking from lack of experience.
I may not be ahie to express myscîf as well
as the legal gentlemen sitting on eacb side
of me. I listeoed to their stories. 1 oeed nt
tel] my honourabie friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) aoything about my experience in the West. Hie lives in Winnipeg and
knows wbat I was doing ont tbere; and my
riicht honourable leader opposite (Right lion.
MÏr. Meizhen) used ta visit me, and he saw
what 1 bcd done. To the young men who are
waiking our streets and holding ont their
hands for money. I would say. "In the West
there is opportuinity for you just as gond as
I had. or better." We pioneered in those days.
I still believe in good live stock. 1 do not
want ta seli wheat. 1 can make a dollar a
bushel ont of m 'y wheat hv feeding it to hogs,
at the price of bacon to-day. I ean make 80ô
cents a bushel on an average crop of nets by
feedinz it ta live stock. I believe in live
stock-cattle and hogs. A men of experience
can makze gond prices ont of bis grain by
marketing it in the form of live stock.
Bon. Mr. MULLINS.

I am not antagonistic ta the poor feliows
who tank tbe land away from us and drove
us out. I have no ill-feeling towards them.
I retired in 1926, when I exported my last
shipment of cattle and quit tbe ]ive stock
îndustry. 1 sold my two farms of 1,000 acres
eacb, on Portage avenue, one ta an Irishman, the other ta a Scotchman. They were
bathi making money by feediog live stock and
cutting wild bay. As I say, I do ot want ta
oppose the poor fellows wbo drove us out. I
told tbem wben they came there, "It is no
use trying ta grow crops." 1 had been there
many years and saw what the drouèht did.
And may I add, ail the pests we bad up
there came from the United States. The honourable member fram Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) knows that the mange came over
the line inta aur cattie and we had ta put in
clip chutes. Then wýe bad grasshnppers--tbey
aIl came fram the other side; and rust also.
lI we could anly have a year without those
pests, I believe there would be changed conditions in Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. MARSHIALL: The hoourable
member from Winoipeg South-Centrc (Hon.
Mr. Haig) said that the effect of this Bill
is ta tax the gond farmer ta help the poor
farmer. I hope he docs not mean poor in
the sense of incapable.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG:

Oh,

o.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: As ta the drought
in Alberta, ail the hast crops this last year
were in southern Alberta. The Peace river
country was prctty well dried ont, and tbey
bad a bad time getting a crop around Edmonton, hecause of Jack of rai.
Tbe trouble is
the ramn does ot came where von want it.
With the exception of that Medicine Hiat
corner clown ta the boundaryflan. Mr. HAIG: Purple Springs.
lion. Mr. MAiRSHALL: Well, that is on
thb, waiv. Outside of that corner therc was a
gnn(l crop in soîîthern Alberta. WNe had a
bill before us a few daYs ega ta take farmers
in drouglit arcas off the land and fonce it
for grazing pinrposes. You cannot perempturiiY order a man ta mov e off bis place, but
thiis oxrn ntand preceding Govcrnments
havp been working over a period cf years ta
cisify this l and. They are working now in
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba ta segregatù lands that are marginal or sub-maginal
in order ta fonce tbem off for pasture and
irv ta r-seed them ta some kiod of grass.
It, m9Y nt give as gond resuits as the original
gra-.s. but thex' are testing varieties which are
making fairly gond pasture.
1 hope that

MAY il, 1i3
neyer again will any Government allow those
sections of land to be homesteaded.
In answer to a further objection I may
say that this Bill will flot keep men on the
land very long, because ail they can get is a
couple of dollars per acre on haîf of their
tilled land. If a man is seeding in the spring
and sowing three-quarters to a bushel of wheat
to the acre and doing the work necessary to
put the land in good condition, he is flot
getting very much out of it in the form of
a bonus of $2. At best, it will help him along
in the meantime. Those who will be taxed
will have been fortunate enough to have a good
crop. John Stuart Mill laid down what has
always been regarded as a sound principle of
taxation, that taxes should be levied on people
according to their ability to pay. I do not
think there will be any objection on the part
of those who are best able to pay, to contributing to the proposed fund. The main
purpose of this measure is to help the unfortunate fellows over the hili. And we must
help them. If we do not do it in this way,
we shahl have to give thema seed grain year
after year. By this method they can preserve their self-respect. Tihey know what
thcy wiIl get, and, if their land will flot sustain them, whatever Government happen to
be in power will continue to move them off,
as both this and the previous Government
have heen doing, on to land that is more likely
to have sufficient rainfaîl.
I arn sorry to have to agree with my honourable friend from Winnipeg South-Centre
when he says the reports are that so far
this year is not giving very great promise of
good crops. The outlook is fairly bleak.
That emphasizes the necessity of this Bill,
which constitutes an earnest effort to put the
matter on a proper kind of foundation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In answer to the
suggestion that there may he discrimination,
will my honourable friend tell us how this
Bill will operate in the case of farmers who
grow products other than grain?
The man whe
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
does not market any grain at an elevator
contributes nothing under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
anything?

He does net get

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: .Oh, yes, if he is
growing grain and has a crop faîlure; and
you cannot raise live stock without growing
grain.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, no. Take the
farmer in the East who grows potatoes. What
help does he get from the Government?

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Bless my heartl
What would he do with potatoes out there?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Just a second.
The West is not the only part of Canada
that must be looked after by the Government. Do you think this Bill is quite fair
to the whole community when under it
certain farmers are selected and given aid to
the tune of some $50,000,000 a year, but no
attention is paid to farmers in other parts of
the country who may be just as badly off?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. This Bihl
apphies only to the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Peace
River spring wheat districts of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know. But has my
honourable friend no difficulty in defending
this proposed hegishation when other provinces are net looked after at ahi?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The other provinces have not had these calamities. We are
trying to begin the collection of money from
the Western farmers who have a crop. The
money wihl not be collected outside of the
three Western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You collect $2,000,000. Where do you get the $50,000,000
you pay out?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: We shahl not pay
$50,000,000. Such a suggestion is quite absurd.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: At what sum do
you estimate the annual cost?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL That is pretty difficult to calculate off-hand, but it wili not be
$50,000,000 this year, when we are paying
80 cents for wheat, which practically amounts
to a bonus of 12 cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. ýDANDURAND: I suggest that
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
adjourn his questioning to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, which wili meet on this
Bill to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 83, an Act to Assist Agriculture
in the Prairie Provinces.
He said: The committee has made two
minor amendements to the Bill. The first was
suggested by the Law Clerk of the Senate and
the Minister of Agriculture, and the second
by the Minister of Agriculture.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I desire te make a few
remarks on the Bill at this stage. I make
them not in the hope cf defeating the measure,
but because of my desire to put on record my
views as to, first, the constitutionality of the
Bill, and second, and far more important, the
gencral tendency of legislation of this kind,
of which this is perhaps the most conspicuous
instance we have ever had.
As respects the power of Parliament to pass
the measure, I draw attention to the fact that
this is in reality a crop insurance scheme.
It is not a taxation measure at all. There is
collection of money under it, but not for the
general purposes of the Dominion, an aim
which must characterize taxation.
In the
committee the Minister sought to defend the
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

constitutionality of this Bill on the ground
that Parliament may adopt any system of
taxation it chooses. I think the words he used
were, "It can adopt any mode or system."
But the taxation must be a valid taxation and
not merely a collection of money for an ultra
vires purpose. The collection of money in the
instance of this Bill is intended to provide
an insurance fund for the purpose of recouping, or partially recouping, those who suffer
from crop failure. Indeed, the scheme of this
measure does not even call for contribution
by the Dominion, as did the social insurance
legislation recently declared invalid.
The
scheme contemplates that all payments will
come from individuals.
It may be that
because of wrong calculations supporting the
financial plan of this measure, the Dominion
will have to contribute. In my opinion it
will, and very heavily.
But the general
nature of the Bill does not contemplate that.
It is an insurance measure through and
through. Its taxation feature-if, indeed, it
can be so described, which I for my part
deny-is subsidiary and incidental.
The
whole general plan is an insurance plan.
Therefore it is distinctly ultra vires, under
the decision of a year ago.
It is also ultra vires under the decisions
in the Board of Commerce case, the Snyder
case and the Marketing Act case. Further,
it would look to me to be such a Bill as will
very likely be challenged, because indisputably
it would compel individuals over large areas
to contribute money for which they would
get nothing back. I question the wisdom
of this.
Were it not for the character of judgments
we have had, of which the last is by far the
most appalling example in this special line,
this measure might be soundly based on
the peace, order and good government
section of the British North America Act.
Unfortunately it cannot now be so based.
Its legality cannot rest upon the Dominion's
jurisdiction in agriculture, because it does
not deal with agriculture. When agricultural
products are severed from the soil and processed, or even severed without being processed, they become articles of commerce. Nor
can the measure be justified on the ground of
our trade and commerce jurisdiction, because
it has nothing to do with trade and commerce.
When the social insurance legislation was
before Parliament vigorous efforts were made
to convince the country that it was ultra
vires. I did not think it was. It was not
ultra vires under the Board of Commerce
decision, as this one is; and it could not have
been ultra vires under the Marketing Act
decision, because that decision had not then

MAY 12, 1939
been rendered. But the law lords of the
Privy Council no doubt had knowledge that
at least one political party in Canada was
urging that it was ultra vires, and they knew
of course that the nine provinces, as represented by their governments, were so contending. In that atmosphere they gave their
judgment. They cannot give any other now.
This measure is far more clearly ultra vires
than the Social Insurance Act. It would have
been declared ultra vires even then, but now,
after that pronouncement, it cannot be declared otherwise.
I know there are those who say, "Well,
pass it anyway, and maybe it will precipitate
some change in the statute whieh is the
foundation of our Constitution." Well, I
would rather go about the matter more frankly
and more directly. I fear vast sums will be
paid under this legislation and we shall be
left in a bog.
My next words are addressed to the general
character of the measure. That it bas features
laudable from one angle of view, there is
no question, and I for one do not doubt the
bona fides of the Minister who introduces the
Bill. We have for years been purchasing one
of the great commodities of this countrywheat. We have been doing so because we
could notwitness the devastation which would
result throughout Western Canada if a certain
price were not paid for its primary crop. At
the sarne time we have been contributing many
millions to alleviate distress and maintain
subsistence on a rather meagre but reasonable
level. The Minister's attitude-and it is the
only attitude anyone can take who favours this
measure-is that he would much prefer to have
people in our agricultural districts who suifer
distress because of failure of their crop, and
in a major degree through no fault of their
own, placed in a less humiliating position
than that of being in receipt of relief. I
should prefer it too, but what I do fear, and
what I am as convinced of as I can be of
anything, is this: you cannot work the scheme
of civilization in harmony with the liberty
which we have as free citizens in a democratic
country on any National Socialistie basis. It
may not be a pleasant conclusion to reach,
but it is inexorably true, that free people
cannot maintain their institutions and make
the machine function without the suffering of
people who through failure of individual effort
or by the hand of fortune are in distress.
It cannot be avoided. We got away from it
in some degree, though not so far as we are
getting away now, in respect of old age pensions. We lifted off the individual what seemed
like some measure of humiliation due to his
failure to store up something to live on in his
old age. Now we know the abuses which have

38

resulted. Yet the old age pension scheme bas
more to defend it, because the individual
must be in need before he is entitled to a
pension, but assistance under this proposal
is not based wholly upon need. Clearly under
this Bill, and frankly by the word of the
Minister who is its sponsor, a man may be
in receipt of this insurance when he has
no need at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Exceptionally.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
exceptionally. I will come to a discussion
of that a little later. It is based, not upon
need, but upon the principle of insurance.
Really it is insurance to which the State will
have to contribute without question, and in
tremendous measure.
When you take away the consequences of
failure, due in many cases to shiftlessness-.
not always, but very often, in major degreeyou take away that incentive which is the
essential of a free people. The democratic
machine cannot continue to operate in that
way. Under the totalitarian system there
would not be much difficulty in directing
people on semi-desert land to go where the
State says they ought to be; but it cannot be
done under the institutions we support. We
put a premium on their staying on this semidesert land, and if failure comes they will
not feel they are in receipt of charity, but
will be supported in the belief that what they
are getting is their right.
I should like the State to be able to do
all these things now proposed, but it cannot.
Wlen you try to make democracy work along
with National Socialism you produce two
results. First, you drive irresistibly towards
bankruptcy, for he who promises the highest
and widest distribution gets the vote. You
also weaken the moral fibre of your people.
The two systems will not go together. Other
states have tried, and you know what has
resulted. We may try, but year by year we
find ourselves down deeper and ever deeper
financially, with the moral fibre weaker and
ever weaker; and the end need not be
described.
For these reasons I am opposed to the
measure. I do not say this Government is
the first to take this path, but I believe the
path is wrong, and we must recognize the
truth and reverse our steps.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion
for the third reading of the Bill?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On division.
I do not know that anyone else is opposed to
the Bill, but I want to go on record as being
against it.

At the time I very humbly put to him this
question:
May I ask my honourable friend who has
proposed that the road should be made available to the United States in time of war?

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

He answered:
It is proposed in a Washington dispatch.

BRITISH COLUMBIA-ALASKA HIGHWAY

And he mildly reprimanded me in these
words:
I do not see how anyone from that province
can be ignorant of that aspect of the matter.

DISCUSSION

CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Monday, May 8,
the adjourned debate on the question proposed by Hon. Mr. Griesbach, drawing the
attention of the Senate to a proposal for the
construction of a military motor road from the
United States boundary through Canadian
territory to the United States territory of
Alaska.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, some time earlier this session I
thought seriously of introducing a resolution
on this important question, but as I thought
it was mostly of interest to Western members. I felt that as a junior member I should
not venture to bring it to the attention of
the lHouse. However, after the remarks of
my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) the situation now appears
to me to be somewhat changed. It has ceased
to be a local or even a national question.
The honourable senator has told us what,
I presume, is the sole basis of his action. He
states there is some apprehension lest this
road, if constructed, involve us in serious
international complications with our neighbour the United States, or, worse still, in a
war with Japan, into which we may drag
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England-in a word, the whole British Empire.
If that be the situation, I have no hesitancy
in discussing what he deems to be a grave
national problem.
In his notice the honourable member
states:
That he will draw the attention of the
Senate to a proposal for the construction of
a military motor road from the United States
boundary through Canadian territory to the
United States territory of Alaska.
I listened with the keenest interest to my
honourable friend's opening remarks.
He
said:
Coupled with the advancement of the money
necessary for the cost of construction is the
further proposal that the road shall be made
available to the United States in time of war,
for the movement of troops and military
supplies.
The lon. the SPEAKER.

Well, for my part I am net ignorant of the
fact that in some Washington dispatch such
a proposal may have been made. My honourable friend in a later statement, referring
again to this Washington dispatch, said that
the question had been discussed in some newspapers in British Columbia. I am not ignorant
of that, and other honourable members of
this House are not ignorant of it; but I
was ignorant of the fact that a Washington
dispatch could be the basis of a serions discussion of threats of war and of international
complications such as have been suggested.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
submarine.

And the Halifax

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: At least someone
clained to have seen that.
When my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Griehach) speaks again. in reply, le may
have more information on the subject, but
up te date there is not a single word, except
some newspaper gossip, upon which to base
this nost serions proposition that we should
refrain fromt the construction of this road
because of the possibility that it may involve
us in war with Japan.
So far as the discussion to date is concerned. I think that, having given a complete
answer in regard to this cloud of war which
was so graphically described, I might stop
here; but the question is entitled to discussion
on far greater and more fundamental grounds,
and, with your permission, now that it is
before us, I shall proceed to deal with some
further aspects of the case.
The honourable gentleman, having based
his contention on a dispatch by a reporter,
whom we know not, in a newspaper which is
not named, proceeds to bolster up his case by
the suggestion that there are circumstantial
reasons why this dispatch is probably true.
The circumstantial evidence he offers is the
statement that the road can be of no earthly
use to the United States except for military
purposes, and that it is of no use at all to
Canada. I quote from four paragraphs of the
hoonourable gentleman's speech as reported at
page 316 of Hansard. First:

MAY 12, 1939
The oui y revenue possible from this proposed
road would be by way of toile. It is nlot a
commercial proposition in any sense; iti impiy
je
a miiitary road.
Again:
What should interest everybody ie the nature
of the agreement to *be entered into. Its sole
purpose wouid be to, aid the naval and miiitary
situation of the United States in case of a
confiict.
And again:
It is obvious that the road is flot in competition with sea-borne traffic at ail, and it
can be oi no value whatever except for mii.
tary purposes.
And, final-iy, in the next column:
1 need nlot discuse the peculiar viewe of
such persons, but I wouid certainiy direct
attention to the fact that, having regard to
the importance of the road to the United States
in the event 1 have described, -and the practically entire useiessness to Canada of such a
road meanwhiie, we may assume the United
States wiil not put a dollar into the construction of that road uniess there are assurances
hy somebody in Canada that the road wiii be
made avalable for miiitary purposes in time
oi war.
These statements having been not oniy
made in this Huse, but also broadcast in
the newspapers ni Canada, I think that those
ni us who are convinced that this road wouid
be nf real value to Canada, apart altogether
fromn the military imaginings which have been
offered, shouid challenge such propositions as
being entirely incorrect. 1 hope, honourabie
members, that we are not so, obsessed with
what we hear at this time about war, and
the Poiish Corridor, and impending disaster,
as to, be unable to consider some of our awn
local problems on their merits, and in their
commercial and social aspects. I cannot picture British Columbia as a Poiish Corridor.
1 cannot picture to myseif any situation in
which any miiitary road, whether of fifty
miles or fifty yards, would develop on this
continent any condition comparable with those
troublesome conditions existing in Europe at
the present time. I wouid ask honourabie
members. therefore, to look for a moment at
this question from the standpoint of the
United States and the standpoint of Canada.
From my knowledge oi the Alaska highway
as part of the great propased highway from
South America élean thraugh ta Alaska, I
wauid say that so far as the United States is
concerned the military aspect is purely
secondary, and was not at ail ini the minds ni
the people or the Governsnent of that country
when this acheme was initiated. I think I
should point out that there are two, factors
that might give the military aspect more
colour than is warranted. One is that those
who were advocating the raad in the United
States wouid naturaily offer ta their ow-n
.71498--25

385

people every possible reason for the advancement of the seheme, and if ta some people the
military aspect presents a gond argument,
it wiil, ni course, be used whether it is the
most important one or not. Anather feature
which has a bearing on this question, but
which probably is somewhat misleading, is the
fact that the engineering work nf the United
States Government is entirely in the charge
of the War Department. When bridges or
docks are to be built, ar such works as the
Boulder Dam undertaken, the only engineering
organization to handie them is that ai the
War Department. To it is entrusted the task
of carrying out any public work in the United
States, whether its aspect is military or civil.
Alaka comprises a territory one-fifth the
size oi the United States. I took the trouble
to go ta the Library and look up the 1938
supplement ni the Encyclopaedia Bnitannica
for information in this regard. This territory,
with an area oi 590,000 square miles, bas a
population ni more than 60,000. In addition,
there is a tourist population exceeding 30,000
a year. The value of Alaska's production in
1936, the iast year given, is as iollows: fish,
$50,000,000; minerais, 623,000,000; furs, over
$2,000,000. Furthermore, there are inrests
available with an estimated quantity ni
eighty-five billion feet, -board measure, ni saw
timber.
Here is this vast empire with great resources,
but, as yet, a small population. Would it not
be mast remarkable if United States citizens
in that territory and in other parts ai the
United States were not unanimaus in desining
the establishment ni highway communication
between those two portions of that great
cauntry? There is no need ta conjure up
reasons why such a road should be regarded
as necessary. Ta say that it wauld be of no
use for purely national, commercial, social
or industrial purposs is to overlook entîrely
the local conditions and the geagraphy ni
that territory.
In the next place I would cail the attention*
ni honaurable mern bers to the iact that the
United States Government about the year 1930
took steps to promote the Alaska highway.
This was nat done by the Government ai the
United States alone. At that time the Premier
ni British Columbia, Honourable Dr. Tolmie,
iarmeriy Minister ai Agriculture for the
Dominion and a colleague ni my right honourable iniend opposite (Right Han. Mr.
Meighen), was very active in. the promotion ni
that rnad. In those days we neyer heard a
word irom any quarter about snilitary matters.
In 1933 the American commission made a
report. I have a copy of it in my hand. That
commission had met on varions occasions with

aMnsEn EDMTON

SENATE

the Canadian commission, whicb comprised in
its membership Mr. J. M. Wardle, Chief
Engineer of the Parks Brancb of the Federal
Department of Public Works, Mr. George P.
Napier, Assistant Chief Engineer of the
Department of Works of British Columbia,
and the Hon. George Black, then Speaker of
the flouse of Commons and member for the
Yukon territory.
I find in the report of the American commission, at page 2, a summary of the reasons
why it considered tbis road to be of advantage
to the United States.
The benefits te be gained fromn the projeect
fromn the American point of view are:
(a) Development of Alaska tbrough making
the territory accessible by highway, resulting
in an increase of population and consequent
inerease in revenue f rom taxes tending to
decrease the present necessity for federal appropriations for the support of the territory.
(b) The road would he a great contribution
to the welf are of Amerîcan citizens now living
in Alaska under adverse conditions, by providing a physical connection with the vast
continental road system.
(c) Opening of new country that is now
practically inaccessible, giving opportun.ity for
settlement, investment of capital and employment.
(d) The new road would make accessible
to the continental liiglway systemn tbe existing
road net in central Alska comprising about
900 miles, providing a new and valuable area
for exploration, for recreation, or for business
purposes.
(e) The bighway would foster air commerce
witb Alaska by furnishing a guiding landmark
and provi(ling' service to aviators along the
most practicable flying route to the interior of
the territory and to Asia.
(f) Promotion of friendly relations between
citizens of United States and Canada.
There is not a word in this report about a
military higbway.
Now, tbere is one point I want to develop
for juat a moment. I migbt hesitate to do so
if my remarks applied only to the United
States, but some of tbem apply equally to tbe
reasons wby Canada sbould be interested in
this road.
I find at page 31 of tbis report some very
interesting information witb regard to aeroplanes.
Western Canada and Alaska occupy a most
significant position witb respect to possible
air travel between the old and new worlds.
There is no land britdge across the Atlantic
ocean that does not include jumps of hundreds
of miles over open water, constituting a threat
against acroplanes that may not be overcome
for m any years, but Asia and America are
separated 'by only 56 miles at Bering Strait,
and even this short distance is cut in two by
the Diomede Islands, which. lie midway between
East Cape, Siberia, and Cape Prince of Wales,
Alaska. Nor does the f act that this strait
is in the far nortb result in a long detour
from the direct -routes bctween many AmeriHlon. Mr. PARRXB.

can aiid European or Asian points, as mnight
be supposeci by tbose w-ho have nlot studied
the relation betxveen various places in the
northern hemispiiere as they actually are on
the globe.
From New York or Mýontreal to Europe,
the s1lortest distances are, of course, by way
of the Atlantic ocean, but to Asia. the distances are less by way ot Alaska and Siberia.
For example, the sbortest line between New
York sud Tok io passes through midwestern
ani western Canada and tbrough Alska, just
a few miles north of Fairbanks. From al
Pacifie coast Amer-ican ports, the sbortest airline routes to Asia, as far west as India or
Persia, lie close to Alaska. Alaska, therefore,
owing to its favourable stragetic location, is
the mnst suitable jump-off point for air travel
to Asia.
And later on there is this statement:
The best air route f rom western United
States to the interior of Alaska is approx-imately over the samne valîcys in wbich this
proposed Pacifie-Yukon bighway is to be built.
The advantages of this route over a route
directly along the coast are then set out.
Everyone knows how essential it is to
efficient and safe air traffic to have on the
ground good motor roads.
These are, briefly, tbe reasons formulated
by the American commission in 1933, which I
say are a direct challenge to my honourable
friend's statement that this road would be of
no use wbatever to the United States.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 tbink my hionourable friend is misquoting me there. Tbe
point I made was that the road would be of
no use to us. I neyer denied that it would be
useful to the United States.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I bave read wbat my
honourable friend said about its usefulness to
the United States, and I invite bonourable
membeýrs who are interested to read it for
themselves. I do not think I need repeat il.
Now I come to the Canadian viewpoint
Coming from
with respect to this road.
British Columbia, I arn perbaps more concerned about this matter than I sbould be if
I were still living in my native province of
New Brunswick., but 1 have an idea that
nowadays Canadians, regardîcas of wbat part
of this great Dominion they live in, do take
a deep porsonal interest in the welfare and
prospcrity of every other part, and I say
witbout any besitation, honourable senators,
that the construction of a bighway tbrough
British Columbia te, Alaska, far fromn heing,
as my honourable friend bas asserted, useless
from the standpoint of -Canada, would be of
great advantage to our country.
Let me remind honourable members tbat
in British Columbia we have anotber empire,
comparable in size to Alaska, and of course

MAY 12, 1939
far ahead of Alaska as a desirable country
in which to live. The Grand Trunk Pacifie
Railway, roughly speaking, divides the province into two great areas, the north and the
south. There is as much provincial territory
north of that railway as south of it, and the
northern half is virtually an undiscovered and
unknown country.
With few short exceptions there are no highways north of the
Grand Trunk Pacifie; the country has not
been opened up. In that vast area and in
large sections of the Yukon we have the last
Great West on the North American continent.
Anyone who says that a road traversing the
very heart of that great area, a road which
would open up a new territory half the size
of the whole province of British Columbia,
would be useless to British Columbia and
Canada, has in my opinion a very small conception of what our Dominion is and of the
resources in that part of it.
Now, honourable imembers, I have been
able to get some information of a definite
type about the territory which would be
traversed by the proposed highway. 0f course,
no one can have a great deal of definite information about this subject, because the country
has never been opened up. But the little
that we have discovered gives great promise
for this last Great West. My information
comes from the Minister of Mines of British
Columbia, the Honourable Mr. Asselstine,
who is himself a practical mining man aud
familiar, as very few persons are, with northern British Columbia. Two or three routes
have been proposed for the road. It think it
is pretty well agreed that it would have to
run through the interior of British Columbia;
that it would be impracticable to have it
skirt the coast line. Referring to the proposed eastern route, Mr. Asselstine says:
The eastern route follows the Rocky Mountain
trench for a large part of its length. It would
provide ready access to two areas in which
-very rich placer deposits have been workedthe Omineca-Manson creek and the DeaseMeDame creek areas-as well as to promising
prospective areas in the Liard-Frances-Pelly
river section. Here again little Iode prospecting
has been carried on, but the region west of
the route seems, from superficial examination,
to be well mineralized. The geejogical formation is, for the most part, similar to the
Cariboo district.
I am sure all honourable members know of
the importance of the Cariboo district to
British Columbia and Canada.
This route would provide access to the mica
and beryl deposits now being worked near Fort
Grahame, to the semi-anthracite coal deposits
near Hudson Hope, estimated at seven billion
tons, and to the silver-lead-zine deposits of the
Ingenika country. Several copper prospects
71498-25à

387

have been discovered in the Omineca district,
while small deposits of placer tin and placer
platinum occur in the Finlay and Pelly rivera.
I wish to repeat to honourable members
that the available information on the district
is only superficial, because there has so far
been very little opportunity to carry on investigation. But what little is known is certainly most assuring.
Here is what Mr.
Asselstine's memorandum quotes with respect
to agricultural prospects in the territory:
I have no hesitation in predicting a great
future for the Finlay-Parsnip valley. Between
the mouth of the Ingenika on the north and
the confluence of the Nation river with the
Parsnip on the south, I would conservatively
estimate the good land at. 500,000 acres. The
Finlay valley varies from six to eight miles
in breadth, the country being flat and the soi]
good right up to the mountan ranges paralleling the valley on both sides. The soil is black
loam in the river bottoms and sandy or clay
loam back of the first bench. Originally the
valley was heavily timbered, apruce predominating. Large areas have, however, been burnt
over and reforested with pine, poplar, willow,
and some birch.
The main valýley of the Nation lakes extends
directly east and west for a distance of about
60 miles, and with its tributary areas comprises, roughly, 300,000 acres, 85 per cent of
which is availaxble for the various purposes
of farming. To what agricultural purposes
these soils may be best adapted would be determined as a result of more or less experiment
in the future. On every hand is evidence that
the loams are very fertile. A vigorous g·rowth
of grasses, shrubs, and weeds springs up where
fire has opened the country and seed has found
its way. Special mention must be made of
the smaller wild fruits, which, where found,
grow most luxuriantly and bear heavily.
As honourable members know, agriculture
and mining often go hand in hand in the
West. In the central and northern valleys
of British Columbia no farming would be
done if the produce had to be shipped to
Edmonton, Calgary or Vancouver, but, as
small mining communities spring up, there
is an incentive to develop agricultural areas
tributary to them. In the vast territory north
of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, mining would be
facilitated and encouraged by the opening up
of this highway, and farms would follow as a
natural consequence.
With reference to the triangle with sides
formed by the Manson Creek trail on the east,
the parallel of 55° 30' on the north, and the
line of Tatla, Middle river, Tremblay, and
Stuart lake as hypotenuse, it is stated:
This undulating area, with an average elevation of 2,500 feet, contains about 400 sections
of good agricultural land, as far as cruised;
the balance of the flat country being jackpme flats more or less gravelly, and crossed
by gravel moraine ridges. The whole plateau
country is well watered, there being a maze of
small lakes and connecting streams. Meadows
and willow bottoms are fairly numerous, but
there is almost an entire absence of muskeg, the

SENATE
meadows, although often wet, having hard
bottom almost inva-riably.
Under the heading of "Tourist Trade," the
memorandum has this to say:
The Alaskan highway will be a great tourist
attraction. Most of the traffic will undoubtedly
be of American origin, motivated ýby a desire
to sec America's only continental possession.
The 2,200 mile trip from Vancouver to Fairbanks will, however, be within the range of
only the wealthier tourists. British Columbia
will be in the fortunate position of being
the chief gainer of all American and Alaskan
publicity to sec Alaska.
There will be another group of tourists drawn
to northern British Columbia because of the
unrivalled game and fishing resources of this
area. The district north of the Grand Trunk
is noted as being the best big game district
on the continent. In the Cassiar district record
trophies have been secured of moose, caribou,
stone, fannin and Big Horn sheep, mountain
goat. grizzly, silver tip and black bear. In
addition, the smaller fur-bearing animals such
as beaver, muskrat, fox, mink, marten; weasel
and otter are plentiful.
An analysis of the estimated tourist traffic
which would be attracted to this highway is
given at page 37 of the American commission's report of 1933, to which I have already
referred. It gives a conservative estimate
of the number of cars likely to travel over
the new highway the whole distance to
Dawson or Fairbanks, the first year the highway is open, as 3,100; the second year, 3,300;
the third year, 3,500; the fourth year, 3,750,
and the .fifth year, 3,950. Most estimates are
three or four times as large as this, and only
the imagination can picture the very much
greater number of cars that would take the
shorter intermediate trips, all of which would
terminate in the province of British Columbia.
I have already quoted from the American
commission's report to show the assistance
that the road would give to aeroplane travel.
From this and the other viewpoints that I
havé mentioned, indications are that industrial and financial benefits accruing fron the
road to British Columbia, and therefore to
Canada, would be far greater than those to
the territory of Alaska. It is true that one
of our motives for constructing the road could
not be the bringing of Canadian citizens in
the far northern parts of British Columbia
into contact with their southern fellow
citizens, since none of our people are living
in those northern areas. Nevertheless, I submit, we are interested for sentimental as
well as financial reasons in seeing that this
great area is opened and developed.
In these sketchy remarks I have attempted
to show why my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has no
logical justification for concluding that the
main, if not almost the exclusive, purpose of
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

the proposed road would be a military one,
and that the people of Canada would not be
interested in it for any other purpose.
I want to say a little about the military
aspects of the road. I hesitate to do so for
fear that I may play into the hands, if I may
so put it, of my honourable friend. I
should be sorry to have anyone regard my
discussion of the military aspects of the highway as evidence that British Columbia is
advocating its construction because of those
aspects. I have no hesitation in saying that
any argument advanced from a military standpoint would not support my honourable friend's
position, but would show an additional
reason why the road would be beneficial to
the province. My honourable friend has indicated that in this connection there are two
distinct problems, and I should prefer to
discuss the matter on the basis of those
problems. First, he says, construction of the
road might lead to the surrender of our
sovereignty over the territory affected; and
his second point was, in effect, that in certain
circumstances it might prevent the possibility
of our remaining neutral and thereby involve
us in international complications.
As to his first point, I certainly do not
know of any Canadian, and I think there is
none, who for one minute would even dream
of the idea that we should surrender any of
our national territorial rights. Opposition to
that must be accepted as common ground.
My honourable friend seems to be worried
over what might happen if the road were
constructed with American money. There is
nothing very startling, I suggest to honourable
senators, in having works constructed in
Canada with American money.
A lot of
capital has come over to this country from the
United States, and we do not regret the fact.
It has been of inestimable advantage in the
development of our country. And in connection with this proposed highway no suggestion
has ever been made that we should surrender
any of our sovereign rights. If honourable
senators will read the Order in Council which
my honourable friend incorporated in his
speech, they will sec that the commission
appointed by the Dominion Government is
empowered only to investigate, to survey, to
find out facts and report to the Government
what the real situation is. One would not
think the appointment of that commission a
very perilous step to take. I am confident that
if, as the result of inquiries about to be made,
something is donc towards the construction of
this road, no matter what Government may
be in power in this Dominion when the
necessary treaty is being negotiated, it will
contain in unequivocal terms ample safeguards
to preserve our sovereign rights.

MAY 12, 1939
Let me call my honourable friend's attention
to these facts. The Canadian National Railway system is government-owned--sometjmes
we say, to our sorrow, fromn the financial standpoint. Thjs systemn owns and operates certain
lines in the United States, andl I will mention
tliree: the Atlantic and St. Lawrence, runining
to Portland, Maine; the Central Vermont
Railway, Incorporated, running tlirougli Vermont; the Grand Trunk Western Railway,
running to Chicago. These lines are held by
Amerîcan companies, subsidiaries of the Canadian National Railways. I submit there is no
difference in principle between owning a
railroad and owning a highway. I do not
think anyone in the United States ever lias
suggested that by our ownership and operation
of railways there the territorial integrity or
sovereign rights of that country are in any
degree adversely affected. Conversely, the
purchase of freehold property in Canada by
indivîdual citizens of the United States does
flot arouse comment. No one is concerned
about such transactions prejudicing the
sovereigu rights of Canada.
My lionourable friend directed bis main
argument to the question of the maintenance
of our neutrality in the event of the construction of the proposed road. Three situations
might develop: the United Kingdom miglit
be at war, say, witli an Eastern power; Canada
miglit lie at war in alliance with tlie United
States; the United States miglit lie at war
witb Japan.
Let us imagine Canada at war. Tlien tlie
Alaska liighway would certainly lie no disadvantage. In fact, I have under my liand a
petition to Ris Majesty's Privy Council for
Canada whicli seems to indicate tbat the road
wouId be a distinct advantage; but apparently
the petitioners are mainly concerned to bave
the bigliway routed tbrougli Edmonton. Thie
petition is dated Mardi 6, 1939, and is signed
by their respective presidents and secretaries
on bebaîf of tlie Alberta Motor Association
and tlie Edmonton Chamber of Commerce,
and by tlie cliairman for tbe joint committee
of tbose two bodies. Let me gîve bonourable
members the first paragrapli:
Tlie petition of the undersigned humbly
submits:
1. That a highway constructed for military
purposes ouglit to be constructed:
(a) Wliere it is possible to keep communications open for tlie longest period of the
year witli the greatest ease;
(b) Where it will lie least accessible for
destruction by enemy attack;
(c) The above-mentioned essential conditions
being given due consideration, wliere the way
will b e most easily constructed and maintained;
(d) Where the way wiIl ha mnst accessible
to the greatest number of junctions witli other
higliway connections;
(e) Where it may be served by the largest
number of other transportation facilities.

389

I arn ratlier surprised at my honourable
friend not lettîng cbarity begin at home. I
liave no doulit lie is a prominent member of
both the Alberta Motor Association and tlie
Edmonton Chamber of Commerce. Surely
lie sliould bave devoted bis missionary work
to tlie enlightenment of bis own constituents,
for, lied lie pointed out to them, tlie grave
dangers lurking in this proposed highway, tliey
miglit not bave fallen into the error of sulimitting this two-page petition to the Government of Canada.
As to what miglit happen in thie event of
Canada and the United States being jointly
at war, surely my honourable friend would
not for a moment suggest that this Alaska
higbway would lie a menace to our nationbood if the two countries were allied.
I come now to the third point, the preservation of our neutrality in the event of a
war between the United States and Japan. 1
was so mucli interested that I read not only
my bonourable friend's speech of last Monday, but also a speech of his delivered in this
Chamber in 1934, in which lie dealt witli
international law and pointed out what miglit
liappen if we did not bave an *armed force
sufficient to maintain our neutrality. All I
bave to say is tliat if tlie only accasion for an
armed force would lie to maintain our neutrality in the eventualities which lie bas conjured
up. it is certain tbat the people of Canada
would neyer become very mucli exercised over
the lack of military preparation.
But let us consider the maintenance of our
neutrality on the supposition that the United
States is engaged in a war with Japan. As,
apparently, my lionourable friend did not
approve of my interpretation of whlat lie said,
I would direct attention to this citation fromn
bis speech of last Monday, as it appears near
the top of page 360 of the unrevised edition
of the Senate Debates:
It is obvjous that the road is not iu comnwith sea-borne traffic at all and it can
e of no value whatever except Ïor military
purposes.
Presumably lie means it would be of no value
except to the United States. Now follows the
part to whicli I would draw particular atten-

getition

tion:

It would be urgently needed only if the
United States lost control of the nortli Pacifie
ocean in a war with Japan. Then, of course,
it would have an outstanding value to the
United States.
I want honourable members to get the full
implication of that statement. I do not think
my lionourable friend bas ever realized what
would lie the viewpoint of the citizens of
British Columbia in tliat eventuality.

390

SENATE

May I say, I am not sure that my honourable friend is entirely correct in his interpretation of international law governing our
obligations as a neutral. I agree there is
considerable authority for his view, but I
would point out that while Lord Birkenhead
may be quoted in support, yet he admits that
one hundred years ago the doctrine of
neutrality in regard to allowing foreign troops
to pass through neutral territory was entirely
different, and that to-day it is at best a controversial question. International law is a
somewhat nebulous thing to-day, and I submit that if Japan were at war with the United
States, and we were not able to prevent the
passage of United States troops over our
highway from one portion of their territory
to another, this would be a very slim ground
for Japan declaring war against Canada. It
might, after those two belligerents had
arranged their differences, bo a ground for
action in the courts with respect to property
damages flowing from such alleged breach of
neutrality.
But my main purpose in discussing this
military question is to deal with what my
honourable friend sets forth as the very basis
of his argument, the statement that in the
event of the Japanese fleet defeating the
United States fleet, Japan would be dominant
in the northern sea and we should find it
difficult to remain neutral. In the name of
Heaven, who would want to remain neutral
under those circumstances?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Time and again public
men in Canada and the United States call
the attention of the world to the happy
relations which have existed between these
two countries for more than 130 years, and
are proud to point to the unfortified boundary
lino running from the Atlantic to the Pacifie.
Do we appreciate what that means-that
there is no other country in the world so
fortunately situated as Canada and the United
States? Australia bas not the good neighbour
that we have; neither bas New Zealand, nor
South Africa, nor Great Britain herself.
But I should like to call attention to the
fact that we have an equally important
boundary lino in the north where Alaska
stretches along the northern boundary of
Canada for fully 2,000 miles. There are good
reasons why we wish Alaska belonged to us;Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -but, failing that, we
are very thankful Alaska belongs to the
United States.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The Alaskan boundary
comes down within gunshot distance of the city
of Prince Rupert and of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie railway, now part of the Canadian National Railway system. Under no circumstances
would I utter an offensive word against the
great nation of Japan. We respect that great
country, but we have our own conception
of the people whom we wish to settle in
Canada, and we are determined to resist
penetration by other races, just as Japan is.
It is no reflection on either that the other
nation has that viewpoint. We in British
Columbia feel very strongly on this question.
We know something about Japanese penetration. But this is no reflection on that
great nation; rather, it is a recognition of
their skill, their ability, and their untiring
capacity for bard work. Though we in
Canada have religious differences, we all go
to the same Book for our religion; but the
religion of Japan is fundamentally different
from ours. We respect the Japanese, but we
know that intermarriage, in the isolated cases
in which it happons, is not to the credit of
either race. These fundamental differences
extend also to language and system of government. Yet if my honourable friend's suggestion should prevail, and we were to maintain our neutrality in case the American fleet
lost control of the northern sea, there could
bo only one result, unless later the tide of
battle changed: our neigbours in the north
would be the Japanese.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. Before the
honourable gentleman goes further, I might
point out that in naval warfare it quite
frequently happons that one of the belligerent
fleets loses control for a while. On the other
hand, it might net lose control at all, but
existence of a submarine menace might deny
that particular fleet the use of its mercantile
marine.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Quite truc. I understand what my honourable friend has said,
but that does net affect my argument. If
for the time being the Japanese fleet were
dominant, its success might be the first step
towards permanent control; though you may
be so confident of ultimate victory by the
United States as to say that the alternative
need net be considered. However, I would
ask my honourable friend to think of what
would be the feelings and viewpoint of the
people of Canada if the Japanese fleet had at
least reached the first stage of control by
their northern fleet. I say our main apprehension would be: "If this goes on, our
neighbours in the north will no longer be
people of the United States. Into this great
wilderness of ours, where we have no highway

MAY 12, 1939
and where the shore-line is indented with
innumerable bays and inlets, these new-comers
are moving down over 2,000 miles of boundYet in those circumstances my
ary line."
honourable friend wishes us to be concerned
lest we could not remain neutral!
Picture conditions to-day, with the United
States as our neighbours in the north. We
have a common language; our political institutions and our common law spring from the
same sources; and we understand each other,
because we are similar in all those fundamentals that go to make up our common
civilization. Most certainly neither my honourable friend nor I would wish to see any
change in Alaska such as might occur in the
eventuality referred to. If that time ever
does come, I shall have no quarrel whatever
with my honourable friend's emphasis on the
fact that it might be necessary for the integrity of Canada itself that our boys should
again be on the battlefields of Europe. If, as
my honourable friend has suggested, we are
likely to be menaced by reason of having a
new neighbour in the north, I would say that
is no reason for trying to block the building
of this road. It is one of the strongest reasons
why we should have it.
I shall close by recalling to honourable
members a statement made by President
Roosevelt at Queen's University in August
last. He said:
The Dominion of Canada is part of the sisterhood of the British Empire. I give to you
assurance that the people of the United States
will not stand idly by if the domination of
Canadian soil is threatened by any other empire.
It has been said that that statement was
made in the interest of the United States.
Let us grant that to be so. If the United
States say they want no other neighbour than
Canada, we can say with equal force and
conviction, and, if you will, with the same
interest, that we want no other neighbour
than the United States.
At about the same time as President Roosevelt made this statement, the Prime Minister
of Canada spoke as follows:
The people of Canada deeply appreciate all
that is implied by the President's visit. At the
same time, they know they have their own
responsibilities for maintaining Canadian soil
as a homeland for free men in the Western
hemisphere. . . .
They will be quick to see that the assurance
given by the President has, if anything,
increased, rather than lessened our responsibilities. We too have our obligations as a good
and friendly neighbour, and one of them is to
see that at our own instance our country is
made as immune from attack or possible
invasion as we can reasonably be expected to
make it, and that should the occasion ever
arise, enemy forces should not be able to
pursue their way, either by land, sea, or air,
to the United States across Canadian territory.

391

I think, honourable senators, if this new
aspect of which we have heard had been
presented to the Prime Minister, he would
have added, as I think we all would add, that
if the time should ever come when a foreign
nation threatens to supplant the United States
on this continent we should be as ready to
resist it as President Roosevelt said the United
States would be to resist the domination of
Canadian soil by any other empire. Therefore, as far as this Alaska highway is concerned, I think some of the fears conjured up
by the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) have little or no foundation. Let us consider this proposition from a
business point of view, always remembering
that if there is such a menace as the honourable gentleman has suggested, that is not a
reason for holding back, but is an additional
reason why we should face what is ahead of
us, take our share of responsibility, and act
as a sensible and practical people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: If nobody else
wishes to speak on this subject, I would
exercise my privilege of closing the debate.
It might be well at this time, honourable
senators, again to draw your attention to the
subject-matter of this discussion. The notice
which I gave was that I would-draw the attention of the Senate to a proposal
for the construction of a military motor road
from the United States boundary through Canadian territory to the United States territory
of Alaska.
Turning to my closing remarks, I find this:
This is a matter of outstanding importance,
fraught with serious consequences to this country, and I hope that no very definite or positive
action will be taken by the Government without
Parliament first having an opportunity to
examine into the matter from the point of view
not only of the best interests of Canada itself,
but of the Commonwealth and the Empire as
a whole.
What I sought to bring to the attention of
the people of this part of Canada was the fact
that there had been a proposal to construct
a motor road from the United States through
Canada to Alaska, and I venture to say that
many people living in eastern Canada had
never even heard of it. I then undertook the
task of describing how it was proposed to build
this road.
I know that a commission has been
appointed in the United States, and another in
Canada, and that they are discussing the
whole subject; but we are bound to take
cognizance of what is said in American newspapers and by American public men, just as
we are bound to take cognizance of what is
being said by our own people. The informa-

192

SENATE

tion that comes to us through the press is
simply this: that the Premier of British
Columbia has interested himself in this
proposal. I have to-day received from British
Columbia a letter which tells me that when
the late Dr. Tolmie was advocating the building of this road the present Premier of British
Columbia opposed such a scheme, but that
he now supports it. I do not attach any
importance to that, except to note that be has
changed his mind. He has been to Washington and has conferred with the Government
there, and certain negotiations have taken
place with respect to the construction of the
road. One newspaper story is that the Secretary of the Interior of the United States
offered to lend $20,000,000, presumably to the
province of British Columbia, for the construction of the road, and that the people of
British Columbia said, " No." The story heard
in Western Canada is that the province of
British Columbia bas no money to build the
road and will borrow no money for that
purpose, and that if the road is built it will
be paid for by American money to be found,
presumably, by the Government of the United
States.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Will my honourable
friend permit me to read a statement made by
Premier Pattullo this week? I should have
read it when I was on my feet before.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This is the report of an
interview sent to the Victoria Times by Mr.
Bruce Hutchison, one of the most out'tanding
newspaper men in Canada. It is as follows:
I have heard no suggestion by anyone in
British Columbia that the United States should

build any road in that province. We build our
own roads. Except as Canada might declare
to the contrary in a national emergency of some
kind, the roads are entirely under provincial
jurisdiction. One might paraphrase Kipling and
say that the roads are ours to open, the roads
are ours to close.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As I said in the
course of my opening address, I am quite
familiar with all the subterfuges adopted, such
as the organization of a private company
which will sell bonds, to conceal the fact that
the United States Government are interested.
But the point is that there is no money in
British Columbia to build this road, and there
is no likelihood of the money being raised
anywhere in Canada.
My honourable friend was most eloquent
in describing the north country which was
to be developed by this highway. I could
not help noticing the startling resemblance
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

which his remarks bore to some of the
speeches delivered in advocacy of the construction of the Trans-Canada Railway. We
were told of the tremendous wealth of agricultural, timber and other resources which
were to be developed by that railroad, but
for twenty years it bas been a derelict, and
its bones are bleaching in the sun. But let
that pass. I quite agree that the northern
part of British Columbia is a great territory,
and that it should be developed; but with
the experience we have had in this country
we will not undertake anything of that sort
unless we can clearly see the outcome.
From all the information that bas come to
hand from the American press and from
British Columbia. we may conclude that the
people of British Columbia will not build
this rond, because they have not the money.
We may also feel certain that nobody else in
Canada is going to build it. Therefore, if
it is to be built, it must bc built by American
capital.
The American papers have gone into some
detail about the building of the road. They
suggest that it be under the control of the
American army engineers. The explanation
of that, as given by the honourable gentleman. is perfectly correct. Here is an American
press dispatch from Seattle, dated April 27 of
last year:
Carmichael believes that a plan acceptable
to both nations can be arranged whereby the
highway could be constructed by American
labour and machinery. Carmichael suggests that
labourers bc paid one-third of their wages in
Canada and the remaining two-thirds in equal
monthly instalments of $30 each at their home
address on return from Canada.
Apparently there had been some thought of
building the road by means of unemployed
Americans who would be paid one-third of
their wages in Canada.
To give an idea of the state of the public
mind, I shall read from Collier's of April 1,
1939, an article which, though flippant throughout, is representative of a certain type of
journalism. I shall read it just to describe
the attitude of the province towards the
proposal
that the American Government
should lend $20,000,000 to British Columbia,
which said: "We do not want to borrow; we
want the road built."
Very well, then, let the States build the
Great North Road, says British Columbia. Let
them leave it by treaty to the keeping of British
Columbia-ah well, Canada, if you insist-in
time of peace. And by the same treaty it will
become the free and grateful privilege of the
United States to use it in war-time.
The other day I read several extracts from
American papers. I do not want to be bound
by them, but what they say emphasizes the

MAY 12, 1939
fact that this large expenditure of American
money will be worth while to the United
States only if American troops and American
munitions can be moved over this road from
one part of the United States to another.
My honourable friend made a very excellent address, and discussed at considerable
length a number of matters that are not
quite germane to the question. I would
draw his attention to this. As a student of
international law-as a matter of fact, not
many lawyers are students of international
law-he should have noticed in this particular situation something which I do not
think is to be found anywhere in history,
namely, a road which starts in one country,
proceeds through another country, and emerges
in the territory of the original country. That
is enough to give international law several
jolts, because, except for the Polish Corridor
between Germany proper and East Prussia,
a case of rather evil repute, nothing of the
kind exists in geography.
The question between the honourable gentleman and myself is, Who is going to build that
road? Is British Columbia going to build
it? Is Canada going to build it? I think the
answer is, "No." United States press reports
cause me to believe that the United States
is being led by propaganda to take the view
that that country should build the road; and
what rather surprises me is that a great many
Canadians are prepared to accept such a
proposition as being wholly satisfactory and
entirely without danger. I venture to say
that if that road is built by the United States,
either directly through its Government, or
by the Department of the Interior through a
private company, it is not going to be built
for the mere purpose of connecting the mainland of the United States with Alaska. At
the present moment there exists a free ocean,
and everybody knows that the sea offers the
easiest, simplest and cheapest method of
communication; and, as I said the other day,
until the United States is at war or in danger
of war the road will be of no value at all to
that country. The only reason why the United
States would want this road is so as to have a
land line between the state of Washington
and Alaska. Persons going to Alaska will
travel by sea, as they do now. Nobody will
subject himself to the black flies, bull frogs
and other pests which it is well known are in
the country that the road would traverse,
when he can make the trip comfortably on
a steamer. I am not denying that some
tourists who want to go shooting and fishing
might use the highway. And does any honourable member imagine that merchants would
ship goods by a lengthy road route when the

393

very much cheaper and more convenient
ocean route is available? I cannot conceive
that they would. So I concluded that the
road would be of value to the United States
only for military purposes. And in view of
statements in the American press to that
effect, I deemed it my duty to bring to the
attention of all those by whom my remarks
would be heard or read such information
as I had on the subject. I ended my observations by expressing the hope that nothing
might be done towards the actual construction of the highway until Parliament had
looked into the matter.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) touched upon a
number of other things, such as our friendship with the United States and the certainty
of our sympathy with that nation if it became
involved in a war with Japan. I have no
objection at all to those statements. The
Americans are our very good friends, and we
should much prefer to have them where they
are than anybody else.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is no doubt
about that. And I do not mind considering the question of an alliance with the
United States, though I believe we could not
do anything about that, because we are
already in an alliance with other countries.
We have obligations to allies within our own
Commonwealth, and I suggest that if there
is to be an alliance with the United States
it ought to be made by the Commonwealth
as a whole and not by Canada alone. I am
bound to say that the concluding portion of
my honourable friend's address was an argument for an American alliance rather than
for a road. Well, I have no great objection
to that. If we are desirous of discussing an
alliance, let us do so; but we should be careful
lest we find ourselves making an alliance for
offensive and defensive purposes when we
are intending only to discuss the building of
a road. So long as the discussion is confined
to the proposed highway and there is no
possibility of other complications, all right.
But I am fearful that if the road were built
while our people are in their present temper
we might make commitments that would
endanger our neutrality.
After all is said and done, we have an obligation in international law to maintain our neutrality. My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) seems to think
lightly of that. I do not think lightly of it
at all. I realize that if we fail to preserve
our neutrality we shall have taken the first
step towards losing our sovereignty. Therefore

71498-26
REVIED EDITION

394

SENATE

I submit that the maintenance of our neutrality ought to be a prime object in our
national policy. At the present time we
should be on guard against anything which
might draw us into a position where it would
be difficult to maintain our neutrality.
As to the President's speech, I referred to
that the other day. On its face it seemed
to contain a very generous and disinterested
offer, but on reading more about the matter
one found the fact to be that before the
President made that speech he was informed
by his military advisers that the defenceless
condition of Canada was a menace to the
United States; that if Great Britain suffered
a major defeat, or even without that eventuality, enemies or potential enemies of the
United States could not be prevented by any
defensive forces we have from entering Canada
and threatening American industrial areas.
The interpretation placed by political observers
upon the President's remarks was simply that
the United States would not permit themselves ta be threatened by the entry into
Canada of a hostile force; that the undertaking to defend Canada was not the Simon
Pure proposition it seemed ta be. In other
words, what he announced was a policy of selfdefence on the part of the United States.
And from the nature of the speech that the
Prime Minister made in reply, I rather suspect
be saw that.
My honourable friend from Vancouver South
indulged in an eloquent period ta which I
would not reply but that it presents me with
an opportunity ta say something I have for a
long time wanted ta say. He pictured the
long, undefended frontier between this country
and that of our great neighbour to the south,
a frontier on which there is no fortress nor
gun-without reference ta which fact no afterdinner speech made anywhere near the 49th
parallel would be a success.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is quite
true. I used that several times myself.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am sure that in
his long and varied experience the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) had many opportunities of using
that, and nobody could use it better than he.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But with all
respect to the right honourable gentleman,
because of his age and experience, and with
less respect to the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), because
of his youth and comparative inexperience,
let me say I do not know of a more stupid
statement than that. It is true that our common frontier has neither gun nor fort. The
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Rush-Bagot Treaty of over one hundred years
ago provided that the two countries would
not arm against each other on the Great
Lakes. In the meantime our boundary line
has been stretched from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. The honourable gentleman alluded
ta it as being 3,000 miles in length, but I
think it is a bit longer than that. Anyway,
as he says, that boundary is not defended
by a single gun or fort. That fact is used to
illustrate what fine, honest, decent, Christian
people we are, on both sides of the line.
Sometimes the orators go on to express profound pity that those stupid, silly people in
Europe who are not of our race and blood,
who wear queerly shaped hats, and whiskers
and mustaches which are not trimmed according to the fashion current here-that those
people cannot be as gentle and reasonable
towards one another as we are over here. And
it is asked why they cannot get along without guns, fortifications and the like. We
get a good deal of "kick" out of statements
like that.
But what is the fact of the matter? The
fact is simply that here in Canada we have a
population of 11,000,000, sprawled over a
tremendous territory, while in the United
States the population is some 130,000,000.
We do not build any forts against the United
States because we have not money enough to
build them or man them; and the United
States are so strong in comparison with us
that they do not need to build any forts. That
is the fact.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That may be
the honourable gentleman's view, but it does
not alter the fact that the boundary is
undefended.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The United States
build no forts against us because we are too
weak to threaten that country.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The two countries are
good neighbours. They are the same people
as we are.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That may be. But
of course in EuropeHon. Mr. GORDON: My honourable friend
cannot say that of some countries in Europe.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The reason we do
not build forts against each otber does not
lie in the fact that we are superior peopleHon. Mr. McRAE: Of course we are.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -or that we are
a more Christian or more humane people.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Of course we are.

MAY 12, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman may speak for himself; he is a
very high type of man, I know. But I am
referring to the common run of ordinary
people.
I realize, of course, that another fact in the
situation is the common fund of knowledge and
ideals shared by the peoples of our two
countries. I do not question the right of
people to make speeches implying that we are
a superior people because our boundary line
is undefended, but their position is fundamentally unsound. If Canada had a population of 130,000,000 there probably would have
been forts along the international boundary
long ago. The great strength of the United
States, on the one hand, and the weakness of
Canada on the other, insure a prolonged period
of peace between the two countries, the
United States having given up all designs
upon us some forty years ago.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does that not prove
their good-neighbourliness?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. I am not
arguing against that at all. And I do not
mind people making speeches about that kind
of thing, because I know they get a good
"kick " out of it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My honourable friend is going to spoil a lot of speeches.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. I would not
go so far as that.
I found great difficulty in following the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) on another point. He
referred to railways which run from Canada
into the United States and back. They are
not in the same class at all as a specially
constructed road extending from the United
States through Canada into another part of
the United States.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: What about the
Canadian Pacifie Railway line which runs
from one part of Canada to northern Maine
and back into Canada?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, it runs out
of Canada and into Maine.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: And back into
Canada.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: We were not allowed
to transport soldiers or war materials over
that road during that period of the Great War
when the United States was neutral.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
New York Central line from Chicago to New
York, running 230 miles through Canada,
from Windsor to Niagara Falls?
71498-2%e

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, that road
runs between the two countries, but its operation would never involve the question of our
neutrality with respect to a third country,
as the proposed British Columbia-Alaska
highway would.
I listened with a great deal of interest to
the eloquent speech of the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). It contained a great deal of information which, in my opinion, did not bear
strictly upon the point I raised. I gave
reasons in support of the views I hold, and
I concluded by expressing the hope that no
definite step towards construction of the
proposed highway would be taken until Canada had an opportunity of knowing what it
was all about and this Parliament had put
itself on record in the matter.
I maintain that the points I have brought
to the attention of this House are important
in the national interest. The Government
would be well advised to pay some heed to
what I have said with respect to the dangers
inherent in any arrangement whereby Canada
would permit another country to construct a
highway clean through our territory and give
that country the right to use such highway
for military purposes in time of war. As
strongly as I possibly can, I warn the Government of the potential danger to our sovereignty and our neutrality in any such
arrangement, and the serious consequences
that might flow from it. I repeat that I
have no objection to discussions on our friendly
relations with the United States, or the certainty of where our sentiments would lie if
that country became engaged in conflict with
another foreign nation. But if we are to
discuss the question of an alliance with the
United States, let us do so on its merits. Let
us not be led into an alliance or understanding of such magnitude under the delusion that
we are dealing with nothing more than the
construction of a highway.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Would my honourable friend permit me to ask him a question? If an American company sought a
charter for the building of a railroad from the
American border up to Alaska, would my
honourable friend argue that such a railroad would be as potentially dangerous to
us as he asserts the proposed highway to be?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A charter
like that could not possibly be got.
If that were
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
being considered and the American newspapers expressed the view that the railroad
was to be used in time of war for transport

SENATE
of troops and munitions, there would be the
same danger to us as there is in this proposed
highway.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, information concerning the visit
of Their Majesties to Canada was announced
in the Commons this morning hy the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister, wio has
asked me to pass the same information on
to the Senate. The Prime Minister said:
Perhaps I may be permitted to make a statement to the House which I think honourable
members will wish te have at the earliest
possible moment. It now appears that, owing
to the persistent fog and ice on the Atlantic,
it is very doubtful whether the Empress of
Australia will reach Quebec at the time fixed
for arrival on Monday next. In the circumstances it bas seemed advisable to reconsider
at once the programme of Their Majesties' visit
in so far as may be necessary. I have been in
conference this morning with Government House,
and His Excellency bas been in communication
with His Majesty aboard the Empress of
Australia. In order to avoid the possibility
of confusion in the arrangements, or any more
in the way of disappointment than may be
inevitable, it bas been thought advisable
definitely to postpone for twenty-four hours the
time of the arrival of the Empress at Quebec,
which will mean that the Empress will arrive
at the same hour on Tuesday instead of Monday.
The programme in other particulars will remain
as it bas been, except that the Ottawa programme will have to be condensed to three days.
The order of proceedings at Quebec on Tuesday

MAY 13, 1939
will be exactiy as set forth in the programme
for Monday; the order of proeeedingtin Montreal wiil remain as it is, except that Wednesday
will be substituted for Tuesday.
So far as Ottawa is concerned, reconstruction
of the programme will, as mentioned, necessitate
the shortening by one day of the visit of Their
Majesties to the capital. An important change
in the programme will be that the State dinner
which wouid have been held on Wednesday night
will be heid on Thursday and the Pariiamentary
dinner, instead of bcing iield on Thursday night,
will be beld on Friday night. Their Majesties
will arrive in Montreal on Wednesday instead
of on Tucsday, and in Ottawa on Thursday
instead of on Wednesday. The programme as
thus reconstructed will, I think, save any disappointment with respect to other parts of
Their Majesties' journey and, with these very
f ew exceptions, will enabie the programmye to be
carried out as originally pianned.
ADDRESS

TO THEIR MAJESTIES
IfflOLUTION

Hon.

RAOUL

DANDURAND:

Honour-

able senators, the Senate of Canada is asked

to register officiaily an expression of welcome

to lis Mai esty King George VI and to his
charming Consort.
I arn sure that this
resolution, whicb will be seconded by the acting leader on the other aide (Hon. Mr. Tanner), carnies the views and sentiments of the
whoic population of Canada.
The news of the corning of Their Majesties
bas irnmensely pleased ail our people. On ail
aides wc have heard the same constant
acclairn, in our homes and on our thoroughfares: "The Kingl We shall sec the Ring!"
What a thriiiing and pîcasant sensation bas
vibrated tbroughout the lani It bas reachcd
cvery member of the Canadian cornmunity,
wbatever bis station, higb or low. Every
household is permcated witb tFis tbougbt,
witbout pausing to analyse tbe source fromn
wbich springs its interest, nor what it imports.
Tbe King is coming! Inatantly, the imagination of the people is fillcd with the éclat
and the grandeur of tbe spectacle tbey
behold.
They have neyer acen the King. Ris
autbority is no longer, as of old, directly
exercised upon thern. The Ring is far, far
away in a distant land; in reality, be is but
an emblera of tbe sovereignty under wbich
ail bis subjects live and dwell. Truly the
King no longer governs. Yet everything is done
in bis name: the laws are enacted by Parliarnents; ordinances are paased; publie services
daily rendered; higbways--les chemins du
Roi, as we say in French-maintained; money
circulated; postage stamps issued; summonses written; peace officers, rnilitary and
civil, comrnissioned to defend our horders
and maintain peace and order within. Ail
these national and civic activities, wbicb
[Hou. Mr. TJandurand.)

39i

seern to flow fromn bis aiutbority, link together
ail members of one society. the Canadian
nation.
Neverthcless we are a democracy, governing
ourselves in absolute frecdom. Because of this
absolute frecdorn, wbicb is the basis of our
Constitution and wbicb we enjoy to the full,
we acchaim the one personage wbo is the
living embodiment of this wonderful creation,
the British Commonwealth of nations freely
united, and we exclaim, one and ail, with deep
fervour: God Save the Ring!
I bave the bonour to move, seconded by
the Hon. Mr. Tanner:
That a humble address be presented to Hia
Majesty the King, conveying to His Majesty,
on the occasion of bis arrival iCanada, assurance of tbe loyal affection of this House and of
the eager anticipation with which it looks
forward to the presence of His Majesty and of
Rer Majesty the Queen in this country, and of
t te visit of Their which its members will
foilowe m interest with Majesties to the several
provinces and to the United States.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourabie senators, in consequence of the unavoidable absence of our leader on this side of tbe House
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighcn), I have the very
grcat pleasure and bonour of seconding the
leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
in the pleasing duty whicb just now, in
eloquent language, he put before this House
for consideration and action.
The passing of a few hours wiil hring our
beloved and gracious Ring and Queen to the
shores of Canada. Their coming makes bîstory
for our Empire, more particularly for our
country; and, as the leader of the Senate bas
well said, it is fitting that the Senate shouid
basten to do bornage to Their Majesties and
join in expression of joyous weicomne to tbemn
as soon as tbey have stepped on the soul
of our country.
Many reasons move Canadians to look
forward, as ail of thcmn do, to the privilege
and pîcasure of greeting and bonouring their
Sovercigns. Our Ring and Queen are the
rulers of free peoples. Rcceiving thern, welcoming tbern, paying bornage to thcrn, we
Canadians arc not moved by fear of dire comnmands, threats or other cvii happenings, like
unto those wbich, we are told, compel other

bas beeýn made during the hast. two fiscal

ever, that there are definite handicaps to the
most efficient functioning of this service under
an Act the authority of which extenda over one
year on]y, and the present Bill seeks the
necessary authority for a period of three yeara
instead. Provision is made under this Bill for
the funds which it is contemplated will be
required for the three-year period. Formerly
the necessary funds were voted hy an Appropriation Act and for one fiscal year. The
provinces have submitted to the Government
that continuity of the training programme, being
assured by the gran-tîng of funds for a threeyear period, will permit of much greater
efllciency and more satisfactory co-ordîination
of the various youth training plans.

sincerely regret, especially because of the
unique occasion, that this legisiation doea not

to find in it anything of essential value
commensurate with the outlay. I feel it
merely provides training for positions which,
under present pohicies, are not likely to

the unquestioned duty of this House to defeat.
Therefore, with these very brief commente, I

His Majesty was then pleased to deliver the
following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you sincerely for your addresses
received on my arrivai at Quebec. The Queen
and I deeply appreciate your loyal and affectionate messages.
I am very happy that my visit to Canada
affords me the opportunity of meeting, in
Parliament assembled, the members of both
Houses. No ceremony could more completely
symbolize the free and equal association of the
nations of our Commonwealth. As my father
said, on the occasion of his Silver Jubilee, the
unity of the British Empire is no longer
expressed by the supremacy of the timehonoured Parliament that sits at Westminster.
It finds expression to-day in the free association
of nations enjoying common principles of government, a common attachment to ideals of
peace and freedom, and bound together by a
common allegiance to the Crown.
The Queen and I have been deeply touched
by the warmth of the welcome accorded us
since our arrival in Canada. We are greatly
looking forward to visiting each of the provinces, and, before our return, to paying a brief
visit to the United States.
It is my earnest hope that my present visit
may give my Canadian people a deeper conception of their unity as a nation. I hope also
that my visit to the United States will help
to maintain the very friendly relations existing
between that great country and the nations of
the Commonwealth.
These visits, like the one recently made by
the Queen and myself to the continent of
Europe, will, we trust, be viewed as an expression of the spirit of our peoples which seeks
ardently for closer friendship and better
relations not only with our kith and kin but
with the peoples of all nations and races.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May the blessing of Divine Providence rest
upon your labours and upon my realm of
Canada.

PRIVATE BILLS
CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: A message has
been received from the House of Commons
returning Bill Z2, an Act to incorporate the
Prescott and Ogdensburg Bridge Company, and
acquainting the Senate tiat they have passed
the said Bill with several amendments, to
which they desire concurrence of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I move concurrence in the amendments. The
first is in regard to the necessity for the company to make a deposit before commencing
operations. That, as will be remembered, was
suggested in our Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, but it was decided that
for the purpose of saving time the proposed amendment might be left to the discretion of the other House. The second
amendment is simply the insertion of a word
in clause 20, and is quite satisfactory to the
promoters.
The motion was agreed to.

CANADA GRAIN BILL
FIRST READING

A messsage was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 62, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: With the concurrence of the Senate, I would move the
second reading now.
The Bill appears to be rather bulky, but
seventy of its eighty-nine pages consist of
schedules. Some of the amendments are of
considerable importance, for, as all honourable

MAY 23, 1939
members are aware, the Canada Grain Act
is one of the most important pieces of Canadian legisiation.
This Bill was sent to the Committee on
Agriculture of the other flouse, and the
members of the Board of Grain Commissioners
appeared before
that committee. Every
clause was thoroughly discussed and some
minor changes were made, and the Bill in its
present form, 1 think, was agreed to by ail
parties interested.
That is, the elevator
people, the milling interests and the producers'
organizations ail agreed on the amendments
that were made.
C-,ýb -mportant amendýments contained
1e
mn this Bull allows the mixing of some of the
tough grades with standard grades up to, I
think, 17 per cent, and the bringing of tough
grades up to standard by mixing with the dry.
The result of this will be to reduce the spread
in price to the farmer between tough grades
and standard grades. ' Not very many years
ago elevators were buying the tough grades at
from 8 to 10 cents a bushel less than the price
of the standard grades, and as a consequence
the producers suffered. One of the principal
amendments will have the effect of bringing
the price of grain that is slightly tough nearer
to the price of standard grade.
There has also been some difficulty about
the mixing of grades. Mixing was outlawed,
so to speak, in the terminal elevators, but
not in the country elevators. The resuit was
that large country elevators were buiît for the
alleged purpose of mixing. This measure
prevents that sort of thing. It gives the
millers a littie more leeway in seiling grain
they have purchased for grinding purposes.
That matter was gone into thoroughly, not
only in the committee of the flouse of Comnmens, but in the flouse itself, on the report
of the committee, and it was decided that the
present provision would be in the. interests
of the milling business in Canada, which is
quite an important enterprise, as well as in
the interests of the producers of wheat.
This legisiation is largely a matter of
detail; so without going further I will simply
move the second reading of the Bill.
Right flon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have reviewed the debate
that took place ir' the other flouse, which
was astonishingly brief in view of the subjeotmatter of the Bill, and I have also given as
much study as I could to the main amendments proposed.
As the honourable member who introduces
the measure (Hon. Mr. Marshall) says, the
Bill is not nearly as formidable as it looks.
While it is haîf an inch thick, the great bulk
of it is composed of schedules. I arn not yet

quite clear as to why ail these schedules
should be reprinted in the Bill. I think that
the main amendments are contained in the
first part of the Bill, and that the amendments
to the schedules could have been set out in
5 per cent of the space they now occupy.
Nevertheless, this Bill is of some importance. Its main features are those enunciated
by the honourable senator from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall). One provision which has been
contested most strenuously relates to the
mixxîng of grades. I may be wrong, but I
think the Bill permits not only mixing of
junior grades, the tough grades, with the
four standard grades, but also mixing of
standard grades themselves.
This seems
strange in view of the fact that for at least
thirty years, ever since I entered Parliament,
there bas been a war about the mixing of
grades. Apparently the whole war was over
nothing, for now we are practically going
back to the old licence, and we have waged
a great conflict merely about the price of a
hair.
There are some other amendments whicb I
think are worth while, and therefore I suggest
that the Bill he referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee. I understand this ;s
the intention of the sponsor (Hon. Mr.
Marshall). In the Senate we have always
dealt with amendments to the Grain Act in
that committee. It is advisable to have a
reference to commîttee, because it is not at
ail impossible that even persons who felt
satisilled with the measure when, it left the
other flouse may have amendments to suggest
here. I do not know. Certain objections
were stated, though nlot strongly pressed,
before the Bill did pass. I have no doubt
whatever that when it gets through our
Banking and Commerce Committee it will
not 'be altered in, an-y very substantial degree.
But it ehould go to that committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: W-hy does my
right honourable friend express a preference
for the Banking and Commerce Committee
over the Committee on Agriculture?
Right Hon. Mr. MKIGHEN: Because the
Grain Act has always 'been reviewed in our
Banking and -Commerce Committee. We are
to have before us another bill, dealing with
live stock grading, whicb undoubtedly shouid
go to the Agriculture Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO OOMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL moved that the Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

LIVE STOCK AND LIVE STOCK

PRODUCTS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the Huse of
Commons wif h Bill 104, an Acf respecting
stockyards, ]ive stock and live stock products
and hatcheries.
The Bill was read the first fime.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
Bill be read a second time?

MAY 23, 1939
*Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: Honourable members, with consent af the House
I would move second reading of this Bill now.
I will announce at once that I intend, as soon
as second reading is given, ta move that the
measure be referred ta the Oommittee on
Agriculture, wbicb I think is the praper comnmittee ta deal wîth this.
Perbaps I sbould make a few observations
before tbe motion for second reading is put.
A good deal of difficulty bas been experienced
in connection with the operation af stockyards and tbe marketing of live stock, and
certain parties have been blamed for ail the
troubles. Up ta the present time the stockyards bave been cantrolled ta some extent
by the live stock excbanges. As there are
some eleven stockyards in Canada and only
six of them. have live stock exehanges organized, the other five are more or less directed
by officiais of the Department of Agriculture. Under this Bill a committee of persans
familiar witb and interested ini the marketing
of live stock would be formced-I think the
Minister said in another place the committee would have seven or nine members-to
settie these troublesome things, sucli as have
been arising over a period of years. For
instance, condemnation insurance is as large
an item ta the farmers now as it was before
we began testing for tuberculosis ail over the
country, but the great bulk af live stack
marketed in Western Canada corne off ranges
where anly a small proportion are subjeet ta
tuberculosis. It is felt there shauld be same
revision of this insurance, and we believe the
revision can best be made by a group of men
appointed in the manner contemplated by
the Bill.
Then there is the provisian for fining a
farmer wbo brings ta the stackyard a beast
with horns on. The fine is one dallar. And
the buyers did one of the cleverest things
that I ever knew them ta do: they nat anly
made the mile requiring this fine, but they put
the fines into their own pookets. The premier
of ane province told tbem they could not
do that any langer, and lie had the fines
diverted to the provincial treasury. Sa far
bie bas got away with that. We believe there
should be uniforni regulation of this matter,
applicable ta stockyards throughout the
country.
There recently was same trouble in a
stockyard where the live stock exehange was
composed of a large number of members,
most of whom. were small buyers. These
small buyers got the idea that it was a bad
thing to allow their fellow members ta telephone out ta farmers and dealers in the country
about the market. They cid not feel like

403

paying the telephone charges to give this
service tbemselves, and they believed they
were handicapped by their fellows who were
giving it; s0 they actuaily passed a regulation, which they wanted the Department of
Agriculture to approve of, to the effect that
no0 member of the exchange should be allowed
to telephone such information at his own
expense; that if a farmer wanted to know the
condition of the market hie should telephone
himsclf, and pay for the cali. That ridiculous
regulation did flot go in.to effect, but it is
one of many things that have been cropping
up and causing considerable dissatisfaction
with respect to the marketing of live stock.
Also, no plan has yet been cvolved for the
grading of cattie in stockyards. A committee
of the kind contemplated by this Bill may
develop some plan that will assist faxmers
who have live stock to market to get better
prices, if possible, and be subjected ta smaller
charges. A few years ago an Order in Council was passed approving of a reduction of
stockyard fees, which the Department of
Agriculture has the rigbt ta regulate. In
spite of that, the fees were neyer reduced and
the business went on as before, largely because there was fia group of men actively
interested in the producing' and marketing of
cattle ta put up sometbing of a figbt for their
side of the case. I believe this measure will
lead ta the appointment of a committee which
will evolve a set of rules and regulations that
should improve the operation of stockyards
througbout Canada.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I have bef are me the Act which
was passed some year8 ago for the regulatian
of stockyards, and the present Bill. I notice
that in bis remarks on the present measure
the honourable gentleman from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall) kept away from ail reference
to the packers. There is a clause here providing that live stock may be sent into a
packer's yard, and that used as a stackyard.
Wby did the bonourable member not mention that? Does bie agree with the practice
of sbipping live stock by truck into a yard
attacbed ta the packer's abattoir, where the
price is fixed by the packer? I cannat understand bis evading that point. The proposed
clause will be a detriment ta the live stock
trade and, a menace .to the praducer in the
country. Live stock wiil accumulate in the
packers' yards, ta the serieus disadvantage of
the producer. For instance, if a buyer in Montreal wants a certain number of cattle, lie cannot wire ta bis agent in Toronto ta make the
necessa-ry purchase, because naturally the
packer bas contrai of bis yard. Noîthing like

the special clause to which the honourable
member from Marquette refers, and I shall
not discuss the allegation he makes. I am
quite confident there will be a very
illuminating discussion before the Committee
on Agriculture and Forestry if the allegation
is repeated there.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I do not quite agree
with the honourable member from Marquette
(Hon. Mr. Mullins). In fact it seems to me
that at the present time the packers control
the market. Personally, I would rather have
my cattle taken direct to the packers' yard,
as then they will weigh a little more, and
the packers will pay as much there as they
will at the stockyards. There is no competition. The packers meet and decide what they
will pay. One packer will take the stock
one day, another packer next day, and so on.
As the price will be the same at the main
yards as at the packers' yards, the stock might
as well be delivered direct.
There should be a very strict penalty against
a man acting both as a commission man and
as a dealer buying and selling his own stock.
Western farmers have lost heavily on all their
horses shipped east. The horse dealers in
Montreal charge a commissioù of $5 a head,
and 70 cents a day for feed. They sel the
farmers' horses at a low price and their own
at a high price. A chiselling market of that
kind does not pay the farmer. Under those
conditions I would not trust my own father
with a horse, for, as many honourable members are aware, every man thinks his judgment
of a horse is superior to the other fellow's.
I should like to see inserted in this Bill a
provision against what I consider to be a very
improper practice. If I am loading a car of
cattle the railway company immediately
notifies the dealers and packers in Winnipeg.
They are kept informed, free of charge, as to
how many cars of stock are in transit for the
Winnipeg stockyards. If my stock is arriving
at a certain date, that is my business as its
owner, and I think it should be kept just as
secret as is a telegram. When I arrive at
Winnipeg with my car of live stock I may
be told, "We cannot do business with you
now, as there are so many hundred cars
arriving to-morrow."
When this Bill is before the committee, no
doubt several amendments will be offered,
and I shall reserve any further remarks for
that stage.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I have just one
observation to make in reply to my honourable friend from Marquette (Hon. Mr.
Mullins). This Bill cures exactly what my
honourable 'friend complains about. For the
first time in the history of this country

4uà

packers' yards will come under the direction
of this advisory committee. Up to the present
time the packers' yards have been private
institutions, and truck loads of cattle have
come in .to the packers and have been sold
them for a price which has been agreed upon.
But there has been no supervision of, those
yards. They were not mentioned in the old
Act, and now for the first time we are going
to have the right to go into them and find
out what is going on; and if direct selling is
thought not to be in the interest of the live
stock trade it can be condemned, as has been
done at some yards in the United States.
I know some people regard the packers as
fair prey. They are like the Irishman's pig,
which is kicked every time he meets it, on the
principle that if it is not coming from mischief
it is going to it. With the exception of
Pat Burns in Calgary, I have never sold cattle
to packers. I have allowed Dunn & Levack
to sell for me. There has been some question
as to the fairness or justice of direct selling.
At the moment I am not in a position to
speak as to that, though I hold some opinions.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Mullins)
has said that everybody should be allowed to
buy, and has complained about the $10,000
security that is required of commission salesmen. My honourable friend will remember
the Richelieu Company that went out among
the farmers in the county of Middlesex,
bought cattle and took thern away, and failed
to pay for them. He will remember also
that in 1935 the Government thought it owed
something -to those farmers and voted a sum
-and my honourable friend assisted in thatto reimburse them for the money they had
'been cheated out of by those irresponsible
characters who had bought their cattle. Any
man who is handling live stock on an exchange
or in a yard ought to be a responsible man,
and ought to be able to put up a 'bond for the
protection of farmers who send cattle to him,
and to give such farmers some assurance that
they will get their money.
I have no doubt that in the Agricultural
Committee changes will be suggested with
respect to this Bill. I think the only object
of everybody on either side of the House is
to do the best possible for the live stock
producers of Canada.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: What the
honourable gentleman has reference to is a
stockyard operated by a bunch of crooks, if I
may call thern that, who went out from
Montreal to the West and offered the people
there special inducements to send their cattle
down to that yard. I remember the transac-

tion, but it happened so long ago I have
forgýotten the name. That was done, not 'by
a cattie Ibuyer at ail, but by an unscrupulous
lawyer who, with some other ehap, conceived
the idea of building a stockyard in Montreal.
I bave been in the cattie -business for a
great many years and have neyer failed to
pay wbat I agreed to pay. I rememiier one
case in wbicb I gave a man in Medicine Hat
a cheque for thirty or forty cattle. Six years
later my banker communicated with me and
said be had this cheque, and asked if be
sbould cash it. I said:
"Yes. Send it in.'
I tbought it was lost." I have neyer known
of more than one or two men in the cattie
business who went crooked.
There is no need for a string of inspectors
sucb as is proposed. Under this systemn a man
who wants to buy in various parts of Canada
will flot be able to wire and get the stock out
of the packer's yard, which is supervised by a
commissioner appointed by the Government,
or by some other custodian wbo probablv
knows nothing at aIl ,ýbout the 'business. The
cattie business is a practical business and
requires practical men behind it, and witbout
tbose men it will neyer amount to anytbing
in tbis country.
I remember wben we sorted our eattie in
the public stockyards. Wbat were tbey built
for? Take the magnificont yard in Winnipeg
for instance. Under tbis Bill, tbe cattle wiil
be run into a packer's yard wbere there is a
Goveroment superviser. Tbe right way to
dispose of live stock is to send it to the open
markct and let the buyers bid for it. In the
old cattle market in Toronto tbe gates were
thrown open at eigbt o'clock, and tbe buyers
ivent into the pen and made a deal witb the
min wbo had cattle to sel]. You are going to
regulate out of 'business the old cattle drover,
tbe man wbo did so mucb to build up the
live stock industry. H1e did not go into an',

REPORT

RAIL WAY PROBLEM
0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Sonate proceeded to consider the report
of the Special Committee appointed on
March 30, 1938, to inquire into and report
upon the best means of rolieving the country
from its extremely serious railway condition
and financial burden consequent thereto.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
ilonourable senators, two members of our Senate
lîav o signed tbis report. One is supporting it
beartily and the other faintly. I bave been
asked by my rigbt bonourable friend (Rîght
Hon. Mr. Graham) to move adoption of the
report. whicb I myself had moved in the
committee.
The report of your Special Railway Comnulitee expresses. the views of tbe majority
wbicli adopted it. Perbaps it would suffice
that I should simply read Ibis report; but it
is already printed in our Minutes and in the
Sonate Hansard. I deemn it my duty, howex or, Io stress a few points, in order more
fully 10 convey to yon my views thercon.
Wbon the Sonate appointed a special committee to examine into our railway problem,
it surely did ot visualize the importance of
the mandate wbicb was being given to twenty
of its members. I express this view since the
senators who were thus chosen to explore the
problorn did flot at ail realize that it was a
world problemn wbicb tbey bad been instructed
to study. I make bold to say that there
were many tbings of wbich we were ignorant
at the outset. and of wbicb we became aware
in the course of our investigation.
We found that the ilis ou railways werp
îr
during the last few years common to most
of the railway systems on the continents of
Europe and America. We found. too, that
xve wore conf'ronted witb the study of the
wbole transportation system of Canada, of
which the railways were but a part, and that
rivais bad arisen which were challenging the
railway mionopoly anti sucking its life-blood.
We found also that, the most damaging form
of competition had corne fromn the bighways,
utilized for freigbt and passenger service, and
also from our iniand waters.

I should like to preface my remarks with
some excerpts fromn an address delivered in
January last by Mr-. Joseph B. Eastman, rueraber of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and for three years Federal Co-ordinator of
My honourable colleagues

will gain from Mr. Eastman an idea of the
importance of the problemn whicli is before
us at the present time. Re said:
One thing whicli perhaps may be new to some
of you, although I doulit it, is that railroad ills

contrary, the rest of the world is very largely
suffering from, the samne complaint....
The British railroad situation is to me one
of the most interesting of ail. It lias been
urged that the way to save the railroads is to
consolidate them into a very few great systems.
Well, they did that in Great Britain not long
after the World War, reducing the number
to four. Not only that, but these four systems
pooled most of tlie competitive traffic which
remained....
Yet with ail these presumptive, advantages,
some of whieh are very real, the British railways are now filling the air with loud cries for
relief....
The trouble witli our railroads, whîle very
difflcult to remedy, is not liard to understand,
and can lie summed up in a sentence or two.
The depression in business caused a lieavy f ah
in traffic, bad enougli in itself, but made mucli
worse by tlie superimposed loss of traffic caused
by tlie great increase in competition from otlier
foi-ms of transportation....
Tlie tremendous increase in competition f rom
highway, water, pipe-line,' and air carriers je
too well known to require description. You may
not liave realized, however, the extent to wliicli,
along with this competition, private carniage
lias superseded public carniage, by. whicli 1
mean transportation liy common carriers....
To a lesser but yet a very considerable extent,
the same is true of tlie carniage of property.
Many industries, large and small, are sei-ved
by their own motor vehieles or by contract
carriers wlio do flot serve the general public,
and tliis is truc in liigli degree of tlie f armer. . ..
A furtber source of great loss to tlie railroads
lias been the severe decline in tlie tonnage of
oui- exports and imports.
So far as public i-egulatfon is concerned, tlie
Interstate Commerce Commission now lias power
to fix both maximum and minimum rates for
both railways and motor carriers.
Wbetlier water carriers sliould lie required
to pay tolîs for the use of waterways, like
your Barge Canal, wliicli were constructed and
are maintained at public expense, whetlier
motor vehiele operators sliould lie subjected to
beavier taxation in compensation for their use
of tlie public liigliways, and wlietlier railroad
taxation should be lessened materially, are
questions which sliould lie explored tlioroughly
and impartially.
Tliere was a time, in tlie opinion of many,
wlien tlie railroad managements were flot distin&uislied liy enterprise in tlie improvement of
tlieir equipment operations and services.
In tlie past f ew years, f aced liy an overwhelming tîde of outside competition, there lias
been a marked improvement in initiative and
enterprise. Thie results you have alI seen in
tlie stream-lined equipment, air-conditioning and
otler improvements in passenger service. Even
more significant is the fact tliat tlie average
speed of freiglit trains, exclusive of switcliing,

24, 1939

407

rose f rom 12 miles per hour in 1920 to 21-7
miles per hour in 1937. The opportunities for
further enterprise and improvement, liowever,
are liy no means exliausted.
I arn suggesting that tliere is no quick and
royal road to railroad recovei-y and that no
mniracles are to lie expeted. We liave spent
in a comparatively slioT time .n higliway,
water, pipe-line and air transportation probably
more than the total cost of oui- railroads.
As tlie Interstate Commerce Commission said
in its recent annual report: It is qute idle
to believe tliat a situation whiclihVas been
created in this way can lie "solved" out of liand,
like a problem in geometry or a cross-word
puzzle. Tlie Government lias no magie whicli
enables it to sweep liack the tide of economic
cliange and reverse the results.
Up to 1922, when the Canadian National
was whipping into shape the various systems

whicli it inherited, our railways had heen in
active competition with onc another-the
Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacifie in
the East, the Intercolonial and the Canadian
Pacific in the Maritimes, and the Canadian
Northern and Canadian Pacific in the West.
In 1925 the Canadian National had made
considerable strides in its organization, and
its rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway, was

competition had alrcady made its appearance.
llowcvcr, the returns for that year and the
following one wcre cncouragmng, and tlie Pi-esident of the Canadian Pacific Railway stated
publicly that hc was in favour of competition.
Up to 1929 the two railways showcd progressive improvement, but the crisis of 192930 was most depressing, and the presidents
of the two railways j oined in a rcqucst to the
Govcrnmcnt for a royal commission to
examine into their troubles. We ail know
that the Canadian Pacifie Railway made a
strcnuous effort before the Duif Commission
to formi a partncrship with the Canadian
National. It was the samne presentation that
was offered to our Special Railway Committee,
and the conclusions were the same.
The essential difference hetwccn the two
railway systems is to lie found in their respective creations, which explain the different
vicwpoints of the two railways. The Canadian
Pacific Railway is an exclusively business
venture, built as an integral unit and opcrated
as a unificd organization with a single eye
to a fair rcturn of profits to its sharcholders,
whereas the Canadian National was formed
out of five railway systcms, saime of tlicm
built as a federal obligation towards certain
provinces at Confederation, and others built
as colonization roads for the development
of the country.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway in its pi-opaganda for unification bas constantly kept

Railways, as if it were intensely concerned
over the destiny of its rival. As a matter of
fact, the Canadian Pacifie Railway bas been
going down grade also. It cannot pay dividends to its ordinary shareholders, nor to its
preferred shareholders. Its margin of profit
over net operating expenses is gradually vanishing. The Canadian Pacifie knows full well
that many American railways have fared
very badly these last few years, and that
quite a number have gone into receivership.
The privately-owned raihvays in France have
been unable to stand the strain. The British
railways are in a similar plight. They showed
a decrease of twenty-three and one-half per
cent in their net revenue for the year 1937,
though that was the best year since the
beginning of the depression in 1929. Upwards of 1,800 millions' worth of railway stock
earned no dividends in 1937, as compared with
390 millions' worth the year before. This
decline in railway revenues is much more
pronounced than bas been the decline in
general trade, though Great Britain is not
handicapped, as we are, by constitutional difficulties in co-ordinating charges among the
various carriers.
The Canadian National, like the Canadian
Pacifie, bas been affected by conditions which
prevail throughout the world. But of the
two roads the Canadian National has a much
heavier load to carry, because of its extensive
operations in regions which are now lean,
but which it nust serve in the interest of the
country. If these services were carried in a
separate account, the Canadian National would
show quite a different result; and yet our
financial obligations would not be altered. It
is self-evident that the Canadian National is
operating these non-productive lines for the
State. It will be remembered that Sir Edward
Beatty stated before the Duff Commission
that no private enterprise could carry the
capital Joad of the Canadian National Railways. That statemuent was made on January 5, 1932, and is to be found at page 914
of the comnission's proceedings. Mr. E. W.
Beatty, as be thon was, said:
I also dismiss the possibility of a change
involving the transfer of the Government lines,
subject to their existing obligations, to a private
company. No private corporation could assume
the enormous obligations which the Government
railways are under. If it did, the project could
never be made to yield a profit and the company would find itself unable to finance the
undertaking.
That statement in itself explains and
justifies the financial results of Canadian
National operations. Our investigation bas
placed the Canadian National Railway in its
proper perspective.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

As the Duff Commission pointed out, Government ownership of railways on a large seale,
as a national policy, was not contemplated or
planned by any Government and was never
submitted for adoption to the people of
Canada. Nevertheless, the country was committed to the present railway policy through
fortuitous circumstances-the failure of private
railway promoters to inake good their.
ambitious projects. The Government hecame
gradually involved through loans and guarantees, and when the crisis came the Government, as principal creditor, took over the
railways with their obligations intact, and not
liquidated as they would have been in ordinary
insolvency practice. There is perhaps a
reason here to make us chary in assuming
further blind commitments which would
increase the extent
and scope of the
nationalization of railways in Canada.
Now I come to the two remedies which
are suggested to improve our railway situation and to diminish Canada's financial
burden. They are typified by two expressions: co-operation and unification. It bas
constantly been repeated tbat co-operation
bas not, to tiis day, effected important
economios. The two railways were directed
by Act of Parliament-the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act-"for the purpose of
effecting economies and providing for more
remunerative operation, to attempt forthwith
to agree and continuously to endeavour to
agree upon sucli co-operative measures, plans,
and arrangements as are fair and reasonable
and best adapted to bring about such purposes."
According to the terms of the Act they
could effect agreements for the pooling and
division of earnings arising from the joint
operation of any part or parts of freight or
passenger traffic, or express, telegraph, or other
operating activities or services; they could
agree on joint trackage, running rights, joint
ownership or joint operation, depending upon
the nature of the property or services included
in any co-operative plan; they could agree
on joint or individual highway services, or
highway and railway services combined, in
any form. These are the very wide directions given the two railways.
I will cite from clause 16 the procedure
which they were to follow:
(5) Where the execution or carrying out of
such a measure, plan or arrangement involves
the doing of any act which by any statute
requires the leave, sanction, assent or approval
of the Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada, no such measure, plan or arrangement
shall bu effective without the approval of the
said Board.

MAY 24, 1939
(6) It shall be the duty of the National
Company and the Pacific Company, for and on
behaif of themselves, respeetively, and otherwise as by this part of this Act authorized,
and they are hereby required, to meet by their
proper officers forthwith and f rom time to time
as they may agree, to discuss and to effeet by
agreement, if possible, the purposes set forth
in this Part o f this Act. The proper officers
of the National Company for the purposes of
thiis subsection shail be the trustees by themnselves and/or such of the National Company's
or National Railway's officers as the trustees
may name for the purpose, and the proper
officers of the Pacifie Company shall be the
directors and/or such of the Pacifie Company's
or Pacifie Railway's officers as the said directors
may namne for the purpose.
Clause 17, provides:
(1) Tribunals constîtuted in manner hereinafter described, shall be erected as and when
required for the purposes of this Part.
(2) A tribunal shail have power and jurisdiction to settle and determine the dispute
between the National Company and the Pacifie
Company which it was erected to dispose of.
1 will not go through the work of the
various committees appointed in accordance
with those provisions. I will merely say that
their progress was surprisingly slow. Your
eommittee probed seriously into this dijiatariness in obtaining resuits. We were told, that
at the outset some considerable delay was due
to the organization, of committees Vo, explore
the whole field and that officials had to be
detached. from their ordinary duties for this
work; that t-hey had been breaking ne'w ground
and were feeling their way; that when certain
conclusions were su'bmnitted to a joint coinmittee there was considerable delay over the
two railways examining into an equitable
distribution of burden and advantage, and
that when agreement was finally reached the

involved and long-drawn-out.
On the 28th of April lasV Mr. Walton, VicePresident of the Canadian National Railways,
and Mr. Grout, Assistant to the Vice-President of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, stated
that the committees were making more rapid
headway in the solution of co-operative projeets.
President Hungerford suggested, in
June, 1938, that, if unification was diisposed of,
greater progress in acbieving co-operative
economies would be made in future. Honourable members will notice President Hungerford's words, "if unification was disposed of."
That is, if the work of co-operation by the
two railways were noV paralleled by a campaign for unification which created a somewhat difficult situation within those committees, then perhaps a greater advance would
be made in co-operation.

It is true that the Canadian Pacifie was
apparently doing its part. We had evidence
before the committee to that effeet, and it
was repeated by officiais of both railways that
one railway showed as mucli good will as the
other. The Canadian Pacifie was doing its
part, yes, but was its heart in it? One must
noV forget that before those committees met,
Sir Edward Beatty was campaigning fromn the

obtained from co-operation were surely serving him and bis plans and ambitions. What
was lie repeating weekly? "You sce, cooperation is a failure! Take my nostrum:
unification, with $75,000,000 of savings assuredi."
This campaign. went on in conjunction with
that apparent willingness of the two railways
to work out their salvation by the co-operative
method. President Hungerford, stated that
these savings of $75,000,000 were theoretical
and impracticable. What has been so far
attempted and realized has clearly supported
President Hungerford's view.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway laid before
the Duif Commission a unification seheme
based upon the abandonmient of 5,000 miles
of rail. The Canadian National Railway did
flot see that more than one-third of those
5,000 miles could be lifted. I suggested that
the Canadian National put up on the wall of
our committee room a map showing the hunes

the map-or a shade under one-third of bis
5,050 miles.
This statement of Sir Edward's was the
only one sufficiently clear and detailed to be
tested. Those 5,050 miles were to produce
savings of $16.000.000, or more than $3,000
per mile. When a few hundred miles were
agreed upon for abandonment, it was found
that the savings did not amount to $1,000
per mile; again less than one-third of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway estimate. It will
be sen that the judgment of the Canadian
National officials proved to be the sounder.
President Hungerford stated that the rest
of th, $75.000.000 of proposed savings$56,000,000
to S59,000,000-would
likewise
dwindle te about one-third when seriously put
to the test, and this result could be realized
as well by co-operation. Quite a number of
these savings lack a basis for serious examination, because no precise detail was given which
could be tested. The reason was explained
by a certain number of witnesses in the
committee, and I have bere, fren page 887 of
the committee proceedings, the reply of
Mr. E. P. Flintoft, K.C., principal Counsel
for the Canadian Pacifie Railway, to Senator
McRae, regarding a request for information
on station abandoment. Here it is:

Replying to the request of Senator Horsey
for information concerning details, Mr. Flintoft
answered at page 889.
Hon. Mr. Horsey:
Yeu make all the
savings explicit and clear te the public as far
as abandonment is coneerned, and then you stop.
We did net dictate the

policy. The information in regard to track
abandonnent was furnished to the Duff Commission in confidence, under a definite understanding that it would not be made public.
Unfortunately, however-no, it is not right to

say unfortunately, because I would not say
any action taken by this committee was unfortunate- but I mnay say that we objected to
naking information nf this sort public, because
we thouglit it inight be prejudicial to both
sides. lowever, it was the desire of the com-

mittee that the information should be made
public, and notwithstanding the fact that it

was furnishled in confidence to the Duff Conmission and was not made a part of their
public record. we did furnish it to the committee at their special request. We have already
experienced unfortunate repercussions fren the
fact that that information was made public,
and that strengthens our view that it is unwise
to make this information public. which may,
and does undoubtedly. prejudice the company
that reveals it in its day-to-day business.
And at page 890, comnenting on the statoment of Senator Calder with regard to the

Canadian Pacific disclosing which terminal is
going to be used, Mr. Flintoft said: "We
can't."
Then, at page 754, Mr. R. G. MeNeillie,
when asked by Mr. Biggar about details of
train service proposals. said:
We feel we should not be asked for that
(le tail information. If unification comes in,
the problem et what trains are to be taken

Answering Senator Calder concerning train
service details, Mr. MeNeillie said at page
755:

We feel it woild very seriously affect us in
a competitive way if we gave that information
out at the present time.

At page 761, in answer to a question put
by myself concerning routes where train miles

At page 861, Mr. Jefferson, when asked
with regard Vo Vhe evidence given hy Mr.
MeNeillie, said:
As with regard Vo evidence given by Mr.
McNeiilie yesterday, we do noV, want to disclose
the details of thýat statement city by eity.
I have been endeavouring Vo find out what
part of the $75,000,000 of savings estimated
by the Canadian Pacifie Raiiway couid be as
weil obtained under co-operation, supposing for
the sake of argument that the physical taak
of line abandonmients, curtailment of services
and abandonmient of stations, shops, engine
boeuses, etc., couid in fact be accomplished.
We have heard ail aiong inquiry as to the
savings whieh couid be made under unification through the application of Canadian
Pacifie Railway unit costs Vo Canadia*
National operations. The President of the
Canadian National, Mr. Hungerford, has informed our comrnittee, in effeet, that approximateiy 320,000,000 of the Canadian Pacifie
Raiiway estimate on that score is pure
imagination and bas no relation Vo physicai
matters.
Trhe Canadian Pacifie Railway bas no basîs
in logic for appiying Canadian Pacifie Railway unit costs in this manner, and did so
mereiy upon the hiand assumption that the
difference in the operating ratios of the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacifie is the
resuit of loose public-ownership operations.
A careful analysis shows that the Canadian
National operations are fully as efficient as
those of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, when
due aiiowance is made for the special problems wh.ieh face the Canadian National as a
coosequence of its being a consolidation of five
previously existing properties, with resulting
duplications, and aiso for the larger degree of
pioneering serviee which is being performed
hy it.

The deduetion of this $20,000,000 frorn the
Canadian Pacifie Railway estimate of $75,000,000 leaves 355,000,000 as the resuit of the
physiesi changes. I may say without undue
modesty that I couid noV go through these
figures except with the heip of the experts
of the Canadian National Railways. I have
tested the $55,000,000 of supposed savings in
a document which itemizes them. There are
fourteen items, but no estimate of savings is
shown separately for the first six items. I
have considered each of these fourteen to
see wbether the physical changes conternp]ated
eouid net be made under co-operation, and
opposite eaeh item there is a note bearing on
that point. Here is the document, which I
laid before my right honourabie friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meîghen) at the opening of this
sitting. It is an analysis of the Canadian
Pacifie Raiiway estimate of savings under
unification, prepared for the purpose of showing the possible earning under earnest cooperation, assuming for the sake of argument
that the physical things contemplated in the
estimate are in fact feasibie.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I passed this

so that he might follow and might be able,
when he speaks, to give his opinion as to the
figures, which are based on the documents
which were produced before us. My right

honourable friend will find that the fourteen
items listed in this analysis are shown in the
first part of Exhibit No. 49, which is to be

he will be able to follow item by item. This

The fourteen items which are listed in the
analysis are shown on page 416 of the evidence,
being the first part of exhibit No. 49. When
the statement is made in the analysis that with
regard to the first six items no details are
shown for any item except that of line
albandornments, which was given to' the royal
commission as $16,3656,000, what is meant is
that the supporting exhibits do not specifically
disclose what services are affected and what
abandonments and consolidations are contemplated. The details Of line abandonments are
to be found in exhibit No. 50, pages 427 to
432, inclusive, that is, as to what lines are
named for abandonment, but without a statement of the saving. The $16,366,000 comes
from the evidence before the royal commis-

sion, which will be found on page 582 of the
Senate committee evidence. There are voluminous statistical computations of the total of
$64,268,000, which is shown in exhibit H,
page 422, and the figures are dealt with under
the headings of " Maintenance of Way and
Structures," "Maintenance
of Equipment,"
" Traffic," " Transportation," " General " and
"All Other"; but it is impossible on the basis
of the evidence to tell how much of the
$64,268,000 is traceable to each of the first six
items listed in exhibit 49 and which form the
first six items of the analysis, except the figure

which the Canadian Pacific gave to the royal
commission as to line abandonments.
The result of that study is that, whereas the
economies estimated to result from physical
changes, etc., amount to $55,373,000, the extent

414

SENATE

to which these same physical changes might be
accomplished under earnest co-operation would
lead to savings of $52,873,000. So 95 per cent
of the theoretical savings are theoretically just
as feasible under co-operation as under unification. I would point out that these figures do
not include the 20 millions of imaginary
savings resulting from the use of Canadian
Pacifie Railway unit costs erroneously applied
to Canadian National conditions.
Of course, this is but a purely theoretical
set-up and assumes for the sake of argument
that all the physical things contemplated in
the $75,000,000 estimate could, in fact, be
realized. Clearly this is not true, as was
proved in the case of the line abandonment
programme. It is quite logical, nevertheless,
to make a comparison of theoretical figures.
From a practical standpoint the case is entirely
different. The $75,000,000 of estimated savings
under 1930 conditions, or $59,740,000 under
1937 conditions, are impossible of attainment
under any form of control, because in a
practical sense it is not possible to make the
physical changes which are in view, or to
restrict services without producing a very
serious effect upon the country as -a whole.
This is the opinion of President Hungerford,
who is a veteran railway operator of high
standing.
Now I come to some implications of unified
management. I must state at the outset
that I have no doubt whatever that unification
means amalgamation. Although Sir Edward
Beatty assures us that his scheme is limited
to unified management, he has repeatedly
admitted that an arrangement for unification
would be permanent, because re-establishment
of the status quo ante would mean the loss
of all the advantages 'born of that unification.
He says that there would 'be no physical
merger; yet numerous witnesses in support of
unification have indicated how the physical
property must, in important respects and farreaching proportions, be mutilated and consolidated, to obt-ain the expected results. He
also states there would be no financial or
corporate merger, although a common pot and
a common financing of joint requirements
would be consequences of unification.
It stands to reason that to obtain appreciable savings under unification millions of
dollars would have to be spent on capital
account for the co-ordinating of the two
systems. No one will deny that. Upon whose
shoulders would that charge fall? Would it
net be borne by the new merger? Would it
not call for an issue of bonds? In whose name
would these be issued? Would the Dominion
Government endorse them?
We have no
precision on this point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

In the course of time, under such a soheme,
the properties would gradually lose their
present identities and be merged, and there
would be no way of unscrambling them in the
event of the situation becoming intolerable
to Parliament or the Canadian people. How
could those two railway systems be restored
as separate units? We must not close our
eyes to the fact that a vast railway system,
like the Canadian Pacific Railway or the
Canadian National, is a living thing, with a
heart centre reaching all its activities, a living
thing affecting the public services at every
point of our commercial, industrial and
national life. You would have to reanimate
it from head to foot in order to re-establish
its blood circulation, which is the traffic
whereby it lives. The present separate systems of the two railways suffer from anaemia
through lack of tonnage. Unification would
not add a single ton of traffie. These would-be
Siamese twins would surely be hurt if ever
again separated.
And what about their joint life?
Any
attempt to harmonize the conflicting principles
and practices of private and public ownership
would be bound to prove unsatisfactory.
Questions would at once arise with respect to
which the private owneTship section of the
board of directors would differ fromo their
colleagues representing public ownership. Services which in the view of Canadian National
representatives it might be necessary to continue or even to inaugurate in the public
interest, rather than from the purely revenue
standpoint, would be vetoed by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway representatives, as affecting
the private shareholders. The next move
would be to have the Government carry the
cost of any such special rates or services, in
the form of subsidies or deficits. New capital
requirements of the common property would
add to the financial complications, and the
result would be an insistence that, as the
Government were paying the railway piper,
they might just as well call the tune; and the
demand for the nationalization of all Canadian railways would become so strong that
any government would be obliged to heed it.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And if government ownership on the present scale is such
a shocking thing as we have been told it is,
menacing the financial stability of the country, should we willingly enter upon any course
which might increase the dangers from that
source? Is it prudent to try such an experiment, say for five or ten years. when we do
not know where it would lead? Is not the

MAY 24, 1939
sentiment wbicb supports unification an
expression of fear for the destiny of our own
people? Should we not have a greater confidence in the development of our country?
To govern it is nccessary to foresee. Canada
now bas Il millions of population. Our country is bound to go forward; it will surely
have 15 millions in anothar quarter of a
century. Before long we shaîl be abla to
support two railway systems in a healtby condition, giving to tbe people a service not to
ba expected from one amalgamated system,
which, bavinýg no incentive to progressive
action. would do its daily work perfunctorily.
I have said that the railway problem is
worlc-wide. It exists where there bas been
no meddling wîth unification-mn the United
States, for example, and thosa countries, like
England, which have attemptad railway
grouping and pooling-as well as in lands
which have adopted unification, such as
France, Belgium and Holland. Unification did
not bring forth the anticipated solution in
those places. nor did grouping and pooling
bring about a solution in Great Boitain. The
experience of other countries sbould ha a
powerful argument against accepting Sir
Edward's pig-in-a-poke. I quite realize that
Sir Edward is attracted by the idea, that,
coma what nlay, the Canadian Pacifie Railway
would join the Canadian National under the
Dominion Government financial umbrella.
Would not this solution which we are
offered simply lead to further confusion and
turmoil, at a time when the railway industry
needs to direct all its intelligence to the new
problems of transportation which have arisan
li the last two decades? Under unification
substantiel financial imprave'ments, other thaýn
those which might ha obtained tbrough
earnest co-operation, would flot ha realized,
and the State would assume very grave risks
in spite of any protective clauses wbich might
ha written into the articles of association.
State ownership and private ownership, I repeat, make an impossible partnersbip, because
of the conflict of objectives. We have had lately
the experience of the Imperial Airways, which
started off as a private enterprise in which the
State took an interest, but which is now fully
state-owned and state-controlled. The Bank
of Canada is another attempt to combine
state and private ownership which was discarded. It is my opinion that the day the
Canadian Govern.ment go into, partnership
with the Canadian Pacifie Railway, that day
the Canadian Gavernment will begin ta
acquire the Canadian Pacifie Railway. It
would ha the history of Mackenzie & Mann
alI over again: first get the Government
interested, and when a crisis cames along

415

the Government with their long puise will
solve the crisis.
From a purely financial standpoint, I should
think this country had had enough experience
in taking over railways and making good their
obligations. Certainly the present time, when
the industry is facing difficuit and troubled
conditions, is hardly the moment for Canada
to be extending its commitments and starting
upon an unknown venture involving stepe
which could not be retraced.
Some members of the committea who are
dacidedly against unification and favour cooperation have expressad regret at the fact
that the committee's report did not suggest
some coercive arnendments to the Act of
1933, for enforcing the arbitrament of differences between the two railways. I admit
that a fair argument can be made i favour
of compulsory arbitration. Prasident Hungerford bas suggested that some impartial authority ha set up to impose its will upon the
two railways, and Mr. Eastman, in the paper
which I cited in the course of my remarks,
also suggested that some outside propulsion,
or perhaps compulsion, is required to brîng
about cc-operative action where the public
interest is involved and the Government are
the only agency representing that interest.
I have tried to find out the real or decisive
reason for the reluctance of the two railways
to take the initiative in this matter of invoking arbitration. It was said that such action
would bespeak unfriendliness. Mr. John E.
Armstrong, then Assistant Chief Engineer of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway, took the position that to have invoked an arbitral tribunal
would have made it impossible to consider
matters on a co-operative basis, and that a
contentious spirit would have affected all cooperative proposaIs under discussion, with
each section more disposed to build up a case
for the arbitral -tribunal tban to reacli an
agreement.
This and other statements along the same
lines have forced upon me the conviction that
failure to arbitrate was due to, a fear of
retaliation: if one party took the initiative
in a certain matter, the second party would
in turn go t:o the arbitral court on sornetbing aIse, wbich it would deem ta be to its
advantage, but very distasteful to the other
company. 1 must say I am sorry that no one
party started the bail rolling. In my judgment it should be the duty of the Canadian
National to lead the way, and its board of
directors should be so instructed by the
Government.
The Canadian National appears yearly
before the Special Railway Committee of the
Huse of Commons to render an account of

416

SENATE

its administration. It should be the duty of
that Special Railway Committea, representing the people of Canada-the shareholdersto examine specially into the co-operative
measures which have been pursued during
the year.
1 may be asked wbether the Bouse of
Commons would be strongly inclined in that
direction. My answer is that it is for Parliament to sec to the application of its laws.
The Act of 1933 is an Act of Parliament.
In any case we must ail admit that the
attitude of the Commons is, for the time being,
the will of the people. I assume that to-day
the country at large is against amalgamation
under prix ate management.
The Bouse nf
Comnions secms unanimous against unification and amalgamation. Is it the function
of the Senate to set itself up in opposition to
the expres-,ed opinion of the electorate, twice
consulted on this question, in 1930 and in
1935? Every reason counts against unification, sax e and except Sir Edward Beatty's
bait of $i75,000,000 a year of pbantomn
economies.

Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable mcmbers, it falîs to mny lot to propose an amendment to the motion which has just been
made by iny honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dzandurand). The purpose of this amendme~nt is to substitute for what I may ealu the
main report another report. This lias been
termed a minority report, but it is in fact an
alternative report, since it bears the same
numnber of signatures as the main report itself.
Therefore 1 beg to mnove:
That the said report be not now adopted, but
that it be amended by striking ont ahl the
paragraphs after the second paragýraph, save
and excepting the hast paragraph, and substitutîng therefor the fohhowing.
Adopting the precedent set by tbe bonourable
leader of the buse, I shaîl not weary bionourable members by reading this alternative
report, prox idcd of course thiat it bc incorporated in Htranid. On tie undcncanding that
this course is satisfactory to theo buse, I
shiaîl proceed to give my rossons in support
of the alternative report.
(This is the alternative report referred to
by Hon. Mr. Beaubien and forming part of
the amendment:)
It in deeply regretted that a unanimous
report was found impossible of attainment, as
in a matter of snch grave importance, at the
presenit juncture, the added weight of unanimity
in the Committee wouhd have been of very geat
vaine flot only to Parhiament but as well to
ail our people who are now so heavily burdened
with taxation.

The aboya large sums already written off
represent in raality assumaption by the Dominion

It is evident that the railway problemn cannot
continue to drift as it bias done in the past,

great and imminent danger ta the credit of
Canada.
Iii viaw of the marked increase in Government expenditure and taxation witbin the lait
years, of our constantly growing requirements,
more particularly for national defence, for the
relief nf large sections of the community, for
rapidly expanding social legislation, and the
corresponding greater necessity of husbanding
the resourcas of tbe country, we are moved to
quote by the solemn admonition qiven to the
nation anewthe Duif Royal Commission of 1932.
It is far more justified to-day than it was sevan
years ago:"WVe feal compellad, as a matter of public

burdens under which the industries oi the
country are suffering by the imposition of

of ona or other of these courses, and there
are obvions limits to their application, the
very stability of the nation's finances and thse
financial credit of the Canadian Pacific Railway will ha tbreataned, witb serious consaquances to the people of Canada and to those

MAY 24, 1939
Reasons for Inaction
lIt is contended that the expenditure of the
Canadian National, even if excessive, pravides
for the subsistence of a portion of the population which, otherwise, might be under relief.
Obviously, this is fallacious, as nothing guarantees that such excess in expenditure goes to
those otherwise in need of it and, above ail, as
sucha policy, if accepted, would lead ta unrestrained wastage in ail Governiment departmente.
The complacent state of mind of many witnesses, including some officiais, who seemed
anxious ta see h e country resign iteif to the
perpetuation of unbearabie deficits, is deplor
able. To this end it was represented that ese
deficits were but an a pparent loss to the
country, as the Canadian National provided for
the nation an equai value in services which
were essentiai to ýits present well-being and
guch a contention is
future development.
utterly inadmissible, as like adequa-te services
can be. anid in fact are, rendered by the other
railway system in Canada, and by similar
companies in other countries, at no cost to
the nation.
Witnesses appearing before the Committee
outlined solutions of the problem, in whîch there
wvas implied no abandonmient of essential services, but ail were designed to reduce or eliminate unnecessary duplication and redundancy
of services.
It je obvious that relief can be obtained otherwise oniy by a very large increase in revenues,
which appears ta be definitely unattainabie
either through increases in rates or through
any concervatble growth of traffic.
Remedies Suggested
Three different methods were proposed to the
Committee for securing economies to reduces
the burden of Canadian National deficits.
Voluntary Co-operation
A more effective application of the cooperati've proviîsions of the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Aet, 1933, was recommended.
This suggestion is far from being promising.
Since the caming into force of the above iaw
in 1933, the total savings f rom arrangements
now in effect, and others agreed upon by the
raiiways but not yet in effect, will be lese than
$2,000,000 per annum.
Five years of trial bas, it muet be admitted,
demonstrated that economies to' be effected
through voiuntary co-operation are of a very
minor order. Further the evidence submitted
on behaîf of the officiais of both railways made
it abundantly clear that hope faor the future in
this regard is practicaily negligible.
The
absence of sinens of interest in the result
tabe obtained by econo.mies, the continuous
and not unnatural jealousies of officiais am to
the prestige of and immediate consequenesto
their respective properties, make the ecrng
of what they describe as a balance of burden
and advantage the subject of a long drawn-out
and alxnost always futile strufgle.
In this
respect any contention that the larger measure
of responsibility for this futility reste on either
one of the two companies more than on the
other cannot certainly be supported by the
evidence.
Enforced Co-operation
A second recommendation, nmade by the
President of the Canadian National, provides
for the injection into negotiations between the
railways of a new body consisting of a repre-

417

sentative of each of the raiiways, and a chairman appointed by the Government, the chairman to have an over-riding vote. This body
wouid have authority to initiate studies of any
project suggested by any individual member,
and, if a favourable report was made by a
majority, or by the chairman alone, the proposai would antomatically go before an Arbitral
Tribunal for final decision. lit was argued that
this wouid relieve the railway companies of
the stigma which wouid attach to agreement
to undertake unpopuiar economies. As to, the
latter point, it would be mont unwise ta depend
on the Government voluntarily submitting to
public odium-as the resuit ai the action of
its representatives-a public odium which railway officiais themseives admit they have
recoiied f rom incurring.
Experience proves
that no Government wili incur odium knowingly.
The suggestion appears to be useless.
lit might be pointed out as well that there
would seem to be a dangerous responsibility
assumed in establishing, as the effective agent
of enforced changes in operation or physical
assets, a Board on which two members would,
as between the two railway systems, be representative of one, and oniy ane representative
of the other. It is important to avoid with
the utmost care any enforced action which
mnight be the ground of iiabiiity ta the country
later an.
lIt seenis ta us the sooner the people ai Canada
accept the conclusion that co-operation ai two
competing systemes cannot be effective in any
worthwhiie way in bringing about absoiutely
needed economies, the better it wiil be for the
establishment of some reaiiy effective remedy
and for the soivency of aur country. lIn this
connection it must neyer be forgotten that the
railways are in a death struggle f or a living
and while that struggie continues, each wii
fight for itseli. The consequence of this mutual
destructivenese f als on the taxpayers of Canada.
It was very strongiy urged before your Comnmiittee that such mutual destructivenese can only
end when the officers and employees oi bath
systemis are working wholeheartediy for a single
ecanomie end.
Unification af Management
The third su ggestion made was unified operation by a single management of the Canadien
National and the Canadian Pacific, each coimpany continuing to own its respective properties,
and no guarantee beinq given ta the Canadien
Pacifie af a return on its stock or on its bonde
or other carital issues. Each campany wouid
continue to receive, under unified aperation,
the net earnings which past actual resuits over
an agreed period of years indicate that -each
would have received as an independent institution, and additional net earninge made available
by the econamies ai unified aperation wauid be
shared between them an an equitable basis. lit
was intimated that of these additionai net
earnings the Canadian National shauid receive
at least half. The suggestion was that unified
operation wouid be under the contrai of a
Board ta be created by Parliament and ta be
composed af fifteen directors, five oi which
wouid be seiected by the Government or by
the Canadian Nationalt five by the Canadian
Pacifie, and the remaining five by the directors
aiready chosen, or by some other appropriate
method.
This proposai was met at the outset by twa
objections:
Firstlv.-It was contended that such unified
management would create a huge and passibly
an oppressive monopoiy.

71498&-27
REVISED
EDITIeN

SENATE
To this objection the following arguments
taken from the evidence apply:(1) For many years very large sections of
the Dominion not served by both railways
have lived under the monopoly, if such it be
called, of either the Canadian National or
the Canadian Pacifie, and have done so without any perceptible disadvantage.
(2) The Railways have long ago been
stripped of all powers which might render
any monopolistie feature injurions te the
publie interest. The Board of Transport Commissioners holds by Statute supreme authority
over them and controls all abandonment of
lines, withdrawals or reductions of services,
as well as of increases or decreases of rates
and fares.
(3) The development of transportation by
means of motor cars, buses and trucks (publie and private) and by air and water traffic,
has created conditions where even under
unified railway operation there would be very
effective competition anyway, and competition
quite difficult to cope with. Indeed, many
witnesses, including some who spoke for
labour, contended strongly that under the
present system of operation it was impossible
to meet this competition, and that if the
situation is not met effectively, railway
labour itself would be direct sufferers, and on
a serious scale.
(4) The modern world exists under a great
number of monopolies imposed by the free
will of the people for the essential purpose of
suppressing excessive charges and wastage
due to duplication. This is strikingly exemplified in transportation, telephone, water, gas,
electricity and other urban services, and in
some countries, in railways.
Secondly.-The other objection is based on the
apprehension that there would be created a
large mass of population, whose united influence
might dominate the political life of Canada. To
this the answer saesns to be that if the interest
coalescing the railway employees is an occupational or a professional one it exists already. No
more striking evidence of this can be imagined
than the opposition to unified management, as
well as to co-operation, voiced by the railway
employees of both systems through their unions.
If the interest creating the coalition be a
political one, thon conditions now are just as
favourable for its success as they could be under
unified management. Indeed, there are many
who believe that snob political power is now
exercised. Without any doubt at all, pressure
in exerted, through their unions, by the mass of
employees of both railways, on political parties.
This continuous, concerted pressure is mainly
directed to the protection of a fortunate section
among all the labouring classes of the country.
This influence is in fact one of the chief
obstacles to the settlement of our railway
problem. It can only be removed by placing
the administration of the Canadian National
definitely and finally above political interference
and in the hands of capable, strong and
thoroughly independent men, whose tenure of
office could be attacked only for cause. This
could be accomplished by placing our railways
under the direction of a properly selected
board, whose only object could be the successful operation of a united system.
Any reasonable cause which railway workers
might have had to oppose unified management
has been eliminated by the proffer of provisions
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

protecting them, in the manner effected in Great
Britain, against loss by dismissal, demotion
or transfer. It must be remembered that not
less than from five to seven years will be
essential to attain, step by step, the full results
of unification. The evidence indicates that
normal attrition, which accrues through death,
pension a ge, or resignation, would remove men
from employment faster in the aggregate than
would b required during the process of unification, and those who suffer in special casesfor some would so suffer-can be assuredly
compensated. These guarantees which have been
definitely offered are measures of protection
hitherto unknown to the working classes of any
industry in the country, and corresponding protection is certainly not enjoyed by any other
class.
It was not unreasonable to expect that railway workers would have been reassured by the
definite statement to the above effect made on
behalf of the Canadian Pacific-which, undoubtedly, would be acceptable to the Government if an arrangement were entered intoand would have withdrawn their opposition to
a unified scheme of management. This is
especially true because the scheme of compensation would be, and should be, the subject
of an agreement in which the wishes of the
employees would be fully represented. and the
rights under such agreement would become
statutory.
The object souglt to be attained is the
avoidance of financial disaster to our country,
in which disaster every class would suffer, and
the poorer classes even more than others. It is
not, therefore, unjust to ask that all co-operate
in a fair spirit to sncb an end.
Persistence in their presant attitude simply
means they insist that the taxpayers of Canada,
for all time, shall carry the burden of muany
thousands of positions whieh are not required.
On this point it must be carefullv noted that the
benefit in the main goes to the more fortunate
class of senior employees, while junior men are
left to suffer for want of work.
In this connection it is important to keep in
mind that the railway business of the Dominion,
as indeed of all countries, bas been steadily
diminishing in volume as compared with business
as a whole. The evidence before your Committee led irresistibly to the conclusion that this
tendency may be expeeted to continue.
Mr. Hungerford, President of the Canadian
National Railways, submitted in his evidence
that the efforts to operate the property on
eionomical lines were circumscribed by what
he defined as considerations of "public interest";
that what constitutes "public interest" was
really determined by the Government of the
day and that if the Canadian National were not
a Government enterprise it certainly could not
be carried on its present footing.
It may be reasonably inferred, as was indicated by the late Sir Henry Thornton in his
evidence before the Royal Commission, that the
policy of the Government, whatever might bethe efforts of the Canadian National management to operate on sound business lines, is un-

happily reflected in the admi-istration of the
railway in increases or reductions in personnel,
in the carrying out of contracts for works,
purchases. etc.. which fact largely accounts for
the Canadian National spending on operating
costs

alone last year

96-67e

for every

dollar

earned by it, whereas, the Canadian Pacifie
spent 82-29e to earn the same amount.

MAY 24, 1939
As a glaring instance of political influence
on the policies of the Canadian National, we
may cite the fact that the completion of the
Montreal Terminal was definitely promised on
the hustîngs by Ministers of the Crown, monthi
before the directors made their recommendation
to proceed with the work.
It is submîtted that joint managership, by
elimination of this and other forms of political'
interference, and by gradually remnoving duplications and utterly unnecessary costs in many
spheres, might well overcome the major cause
of past recurring deficits.
Savings f rom Unification
Sir Edward Beatty, President of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, claimed that
through the unified management of both railways, savings to the amount of $75,300,000 per
annum could be effected under average traffic
conditions, whieh he stated are those of the year
1930. This dlaimi was supported in the greatest
detail by a long line of officers of that company.
These officers and Sir Edward himself were
questioned at length by members of your Comnmittee. Figures and sùpporting evidence for
lesser, but still huge, savings were given, applicable to years of diminished traffic.
As to the method followed to establish such
savings, it secms important that it should be
described in some detail. The outline which
follows is carefully deducted from, and is supported in every particular by, the evidence submitted:
As to savings by unified management, there
were first set ont the conclusions arrived at
by the respective officiaIs of the two Companies at the request of, and submitted to,
the Duif Royal Commission. These conclusions
were as f ollows-By the Canadian Pacifie officiais:
$75,300,000 based on the saine scale of
operations as prevailed in 1930;
By Canadian National officiaIs:
$50,340,000 based on the scale of operations of 1931.
This would be equivalent to $56,440,000
based on the scale of operations in 1930the operations of 1930 being about 30 per
cent larger than the operations of 1931.
It is clear from the above that the comparable figures are $75,300,000 as presented
by Canadian Pacifie officials and $56,440,000
as presented by Canadian National officials.
There was then set out a fulîl outline of the
very thorough methods adopted in arriving at
the above estimates of savings.
The evidence of Canadian Pacifie officiaIs
was given and showed that a Committee of
officers fromn the operating, engineer ing,
traffic, mechanical and accounting Departmn.
was constituted and worked over a long
period. They surveyed the existing supervisory organizations of the two Railways
as independent units, the location and function of the varions lines of railway; passenger
and freight train services; and terminal and
shop facilities. Each phase was taken in
hànd by officers familiar by experience with
each special work.
Senior officiais were
made available for consultation. In a word,
the resourees of the entire organisation were
used by the Committee. The efforts of the
Committee were directed not to determine
any maximum limit of savings, but merely
71498-27àj

what could reaisonably be expected under
normal conditions.
Methods employed by
the Canadian National were described as
somewhat unlike those adopted by the Canadian Pacifie. Botb, however, included economies from reduction in general overhead
expenses, traffic solicitation, advertising and
regional supervision; hune abandouments, rerouting of traffie, increased car and train
loading, consolidation of repair work, readjustment of passenger train services, as
well as fromn operating joint afreight and
passenger terminaIs, consolidating express
and telegraph services, consolidating accoumting services and other expenses. There are
items which appear in each estimate which
are not in the other estimate, but considering that two dîfferent methods were followed
in7 getting together these estimates, there is
an added importance to such similarity as
appears in the two results. It was brought
out in the evidence that in the case of the
Canadian Pacifie estimate the rervices of
an experienced officiaI of the Great Northern Railway Company were obtained to
review very carefully the whoie plan of
estimating savings whieh had been adopted.
This official, Mr. V. P. Turnburke, General
Auditor of the Great Northern, had had to
do, himself, with the consolidation of the
Great Northern and the Nortbern Pacifie.
After a very thorough review on bis part,
bie made certain criticismns and suggestions,
and finally reported that in bis opinion the
committee of the Canadian Pacific, in estimating savings, had proceeded aiong conservative lines, and bie did not hesitate to
accept the conclusions reached.
A number of principal officers and engineers of the Canadian Pacifie, who had beau
working on seventeen committees in ahl,
demonstrated, under the several headings in
use in railway accounting, the varions retrenchments in expenditures estimated to
result front unified operation.. Most of these
beadings were divided into sections and even
into furtber sub-sections, in order in each
case to build up from the ground two sets
of figures--the first set being snch as applied
to the particular section or sub-section as a
part of the two systems when nnified, and
the other set being the savings in each
case resuiting f romn unification.
It cannot be gainsaid that the body of evidence made up by the above process was
thorougb and impressive.
There is one feature of these savings wbichi
should be especially emphasized. Efforts have
been made to give the publie the impression
that savings can only ha effected, or can at
least mainly be effected, by abandonment of
huaes. The evidence very clearly demonstrated
that saviugs by abaudonmieut of hunes did
flot amount to more than 10 per cent of the
total savings that are realizahle.
Even this
10 per cent savings, which might be described
as attributabla to abandonmient, included such
almost unused short liues as to the abandonment of which no railwýay made objection.
There appeared no intention, on the part of
any of those wbo gave teetimony, of abandoning any lines save sncb as would, after argument from alI interasted* be deemed by the
Transport Commission of Canada as proper
to be abandoned witbout sacrifice of publie
interest. Very large economies were shown

420

SENATE

to be realizable without abandonment at all.
The evidence supported, and, save for minor
items hereinafter referred to, justified savings
to an amount of $75,300,000 for the traffic
level of 1930, as establislhed in the Canadian
Pacifie estimate submitted to the Royal Commission in 1932.
In view of the enquiries made by various
members of the Committee, the Canadian Pacifie
undertook, since the original hearing, the preparation of an estimate on the basis of 1937
traffic level, and this showed savings of $56,346,000 without any line abandonments whatever,
and savings of $59,361,000 with allowance for
such line abandonments as it was reasonable to
assume the Board of Transport Commissioners
would authorize under present conditions. This
reduction was qualified by the statement that
savings would fluctuate with traffic, and, therefore, revert to $75,300,000 should traffic again
reach the level of 1930.
The subnission of the Canadian Pacifie
witncsses was necessarily of a te.chnical nature.
The sane conld be said. though in less degree,
of the evidence in opposition suiiitted by the

offieis of the Canadian National.
To demonstrate the very special character
of the argument made on both sides, it is
sufficient to refer to the method used, not
exclustively but in the main, to establish savIngs froin unification.
This nethod required the ascertainnient of
reduction in train and car niileage obtainable
without detrimient to public service from the
consolidation of ligltly loaded trains-a consolidation which, manifestly, unified management could bring about-and from the use of
the shortest and most economical routes both
for passenger and freiglht. The result, according to the evidence, was a saving of 6,909,939
passenger

train

miles, or

14-3 per

cent,

and

_,897,000 freight train miles, or 15-4 per cent.
These percentage reductions and others similarly
calculated were used te measure the realizable
econony in the different departments where
sucih percentages could properly be applied.
In other cases economy was calculated directly
by estimating what reduction would be possible
by the consolidation of departments. The train
and car mileage formula was used to prove
over $50,000,000 out of the $75,373,000 of
savings claimed as realizable. Other teehnical
methods were applied either exclusively or
jointly with decrease in train mileage to establish the balance of the economy so claimed.
All these calculations were based on the
figures of 1930.
The Canadian National ofieers opposed the
above formula and its results by denying that
the stated reduction in train mileage is exact,
and further by asserting that Canadian Pacifie
unit costs are not applicable to the Canadian
National as the lines of the two railways are
net comparable. Evidence was submitted by
the Canadian Pacifie to show that Canadian
Pacifie unit costs hîad not been applied to
Canadian National operations but where used,
had been adopted as the measure of cost possible
of achievenient by the unified system. The
Canadian National officers further contended
that the Canadian Pacifie calculations took no
account of the substantial reduction in expenditurea of the former system from 1930 to 1937.
The Canadian Pacifie admitted that permanent
savings made in recent years justified a deduction of $4,801,000 from the original estimate,
but showed that additions of $9,056,000 were
lon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

justified by other known items of change. In
addition, the evidence showed that by their
very nature the temporary savings made
independently by the railways were entirely
different from the permanent economies which
would be possible under unified management
through the elimination of duplicate effort. The
revised Canadian Pacifie estimate to which
reference has been made, having basa conputed on the basis of 1937 level cf traffic, rompletely disposes, if it is reasonably accurate, of
the contention that large economies are no
longer available because of individual economies
effected by the railways, either on account of
reduction in traffic, or otherwise.
From 1930 to 1937, grose revenues of both
railways fell 21.6 per cent. Combined expenditures of both railways between the same years
were rednced by 20-7 per cent.
Mr. Fairweather seems to be the only Canadian National witness who has surveyed the
whole question. The gist of his evidence was
that large savings from the unification of railways were impossible of realization, as the
public and employees >would not tolerate consequent reduction of the services and the creation
of a monopoly. When confronted with many
items of savings to which these objections did
not appear to pertain, even remotely, he gave
the impression of unwillingness to consider any
savings to which his objections did not apply.
This general affirmation was supported also in
general terms by Mr. Hungerford, the Canadian
National President.
Throughout the testimony of these officers
there was a pervading strain of concern for
the popularity of the Canadian National Railway and management. This is not an unnatural
characteristic, having regard to the atmosphere
in which inevitably officers who are answerable
only to a Governnent mîust live. It cannot,
however, be too strongly emphasized that such
attitude of mind leads irresistibly to redundant
and extravagant services and the sacrifice of
the taxpayer.
In connection with IMr. Fairweather's evidence
in particular, there must be kept in mind the
report made by him and submitted to the Royal
Commission of 1932. This report embodied the
conclusion that there was a possible saving of
$56,230,000 from unification on the traffic level
of 1930, and $50,090,000 for 1931, which latter
year approximated closely the traflic conditions
of 1937. Further, this report was made at the
request of the late Sir Henry Thornton and
subnitted in train conference to the Royal Commission. It is important also to note that it
was prepared prior to the constitution of that
Royal Commission, and before the Canadian
Pacifie, at the request of the Commission, began
work on its estimate. For the preparation of
the above report Mr. Fairweather had the
collaboration of seven technical assistants and
access te any information lie desired from the
Canadian Pacifie.
Mr. Fairweather's original estimate is elaborate and comprises an explanatory memo of
12 paîges and schedules of 39 pages. Although
prepared by a totally different method, it
appears to corroborate generally Sir Edward
Beatty's contention as shown by the following
comparison of the two estimates under their
main headings:

Details show items in each estimate that are
mlot in the other, which indicates that a combination of bath estimates might well produce
potential fields of economy greater than the
total of either.
Mr. Fairweather also gave evidence as to
possible savings nndcr co-operation. In tlîis bis
opinion appeared to un-dergo very considerable
variations as hie first appraised savings under
this head at $35,000,000, then at $24,000,000,

on the merits of the conflicting contentions
advanced respectively by officers of the two
raîlway companies, they are ao of the opinion
that mot beiag possessed tbemselves of special
expert knowledge on these subjeets, the public
would be better served and botter satisfied if
it could be supplied witb the findings of an
impartial tribunal of experts. qnalified by
training and experieuce ta report on the evidence snbmitted. Accordingly. a motion was
made before your Committee on May 2, 1939,
in the following terms:That the evidence before this Co*mmittee
be submnitted ta a firm of Railway Engineers
and Accountants of bigh standing, free f roma
ail interest in either Railway System, ta the
end that sucb firm mny study said evidence,
and especially its practical Railway engineering and accounting features, and make sncb
pliysical examinationýs as it may decmi necessary witb a v-iew ta xnaking fuil report ta
this Committee as te what in the judgment
of sncb firm would bc the aniount af saviags
whicb could be effected by a systcm of unified
management, and wbetber and ta wbat citent,
if nny, sucb savings would entail impairment
of service ta the Canadien people.

421

This motion, we regret te say, was defeated.
The underoigned are of opinion that such
investigation need not have entiailed very great,
expense, because, first, the evidence is already
submitted, and, secondly, investigation on the
premises would only be necessary in rare cases,
because facts. maps. plans and other necessary
data are already available and can, be made
open to inspection at the offices of the respective comnpanies. The undcrsigned further are
of opinion that only by meanis of such report
could the full value of the vast mass of
information, which your Committee has accumulated, be obtained and utilized by the Canadian
people.
The undersigned consider it a matter of much
significance that on this question which sbould
have heen dealt with as a pure question of
savings to the people of Canada in the operatien of the nation's railways, in which question
ncecessarily the provision of essential services
would be a part, there should be found two
distinctly opposite slets of opinion among railway officiaIs, and that onc set shonld b" entirely
com-fined te the Canadian Pacifie and the other
set entirely confined to thc Canadian National.
The question considered as above defined is, or
shonld be, essentially ane and the same for
both systems. The only conclusion is that conm
siderations other than those included in the
above definition mnust have intervened.
At this point again the undýrsigned further
beg ta empliasize the ovenvhelming necessity,
frein the standpoint of the whole country, from
the standpoint of its credit and solvency, and
for the good of every class and every community of the Domainion, that seine solution definite
and effective must be founýd. and found without
further avoidable delay.
Conclusions
In the termas of your Committee's appointment, your Committee wvas assigned a very
defiaite duty, namely:ýta inquire into and report upon the best
means of relieving the country froin its
extremely serious railway condition, and
financial burden consequent thereto.
To camply with the above commitmnent, a f ull
inqniry hiad first ta be made. This has been
don.
After enquiry. the ncxt duty is ta
"report," and such report must disclose what
in the judgment of Your Comrnittee is a "mens
of relieving the country from its extremely
serions railway condition, and financial burden
consequent thereto"; and the "means" reported
must he, in the judgment of those repoýrting.
the 'best" means as shown by the evidence
submittcd.
The undersigned are utterly unable ta find
in the evidence any hope whatcver of relief
from any other source thani that hereinafter
indicated in this report.
We furthcr are of opinion that if, contrary
ta the evidence, effective relief can poesibly
emerge ouît of any other of the suggested
policies, such policies applied to the extent
absolutely essential to bring such measure of
relief will be open ta whatevcr objections if
any, can he offered -ta the conrse hereinahte
indicated.
We are impressefi by the following consideratiens:
(1) That buge competing businesses struggling for a living in the ane field can in
general. and probably aýlwnys. effect tremendous
economies by uaified operations;

SENATE

422

(2) That such unified operations as have in
a very minor way been put in effect in respect
ofour railways hae already shown large percentage reductions. In the case, for example,
of the pool trains, there has been shown an
operating saving of 33 per cent, though such
pool trains stili carry the waste of duplication
in terminais, yards, etc.
(3) That in addition te, savings in year to,
year operations, new capital requirements for
one singly-maoaged system should be very substantially less than new capital requirements for
two competing systems.
(4) That assuming the public interest can
be protected and essential services maintained,
there would seema to bie strikingly important
opportunities for saving by some plan of unified
management in respect of two such systeme as
now exist in Canada.
To ensure the full conservation of every essential public interest and public service, and tor
safeguard the interests of Canada, the undersigned recommeod insistence on the conditions
enumeratefi below in respect of any systema of
unified nmanagement which may be worked out.
The undermentioned stipulations are not
advanced with any thouglit that they are allinclusive. We believe, lîowever, that conditions
in Canada, both as affecting the Dominion on
the one band, and as affecting the Canadian
Pacifie Jtailway Company on the othier, are such
that ail necessary and reasonable provisions cao
be arrived at and agreed upon. The followiog
objectives should be secured:i. There should be no obligation, legal or
moral, irnplied or expressed, wliereby the
country assumes any liability in respect of
Canadian Pacifie obligations or securities,
cither as to capital or interest;
ii. Any plan oftunified managemnent adopted
should be such that th e resulting operation
Cao in no sense be dominated by the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company;
iii. Out of earnings up to, the average
aggregate earnings of both systems over snch
a period of years as inay bie agreed upon, the
Caniadian National muqat be assured the samne
share of suc-h earnlings as it has enjoyed of
such average earnings;
iv. Out of earoings above such average earniogs, which presumnably will be earniogs due
ter economies effected by unified management,
the Canadian National should receive not
less than one-haîf;
v. New capital investments, linîited as they
will be to joint requirements, should be provided for on a basis of definite and individual
responsibility for respective shares of the
capital on the part of the Caniadian National
(or of the Dominion of Canada), on tbe ones
hand, and of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company on the other hand;
vi. Botb parties shonld agree to such
enlargement of the powers and supervision
of the Board of Transport Commissioners as
may bie deemcd necessary ter proteet andi serve
every public interest.
The agreement is merely that there cao bie no
complaint when it does come.
vii. In view of the very extensive economie&
tor be attained, and ter the end that the procesa
may ont involve undue hardship on anynne,
provision should be made for the due protection, by both systems, of labour adversely

affected by such economies, along the lines
lately followed by the railways of Great
Britain.
viii. Agreement tor all provisions should be
obtained f rom each separate class of security
holders of the Canadian Pacific and of the
Canadian National in an far as sncb latter
security holders are ot already protected by
goveroment guarantee.
The undersigned are of opinion that on the
evidence submîtted this country cao look only
te, a system ni unified management for relief;
that the evidence demonstrates that relief cao
in fact be obtained under sueh a system, provîded complete absence oi political interference
is assiired in the statutory terms creating such
systemi; and are further ni opinion that saine
cao he done with ample and complete protection
of all public ioterests.

I amn frank to say it is regrettable that a
unanimous report could flot have been prescnted on a m'îtter ni such gravity that it has
occupied t1be attention of the Scnate for two
ycagrs, for -%ithout doubt our unanimity would
have given to public opinion the strong lead
which it requires in this connection. But let
us be thankful for small blessings. In the
darknues in wliicli we have been groping for
a long time thcre at last appear a few rays nf
light.
The work dolegated tn the cnmmittee was
divided into two parts. The committea was
instructed, first ter inquire into the extremely
serinus railway condition ni the country; and,
second, to report ter the Senate upon the best
means ni relieving the country frnm that condition.
llappily, as to, the first and materially
important part the entire comrnittee is in
accord. What does that mean? Lt is passiog
sirange that without consultation hoth section.s of the committee have pronounced what
must be reg-arded as a solemn note ni wrarning to the people ni Canada. This warning
is contained in the report of thîe Duif Commission ni 1932, in which the commissioners give
thiis grave admonition:
We feel compelled, as a matter ni public
duty, to strike a serions note ni warniog to the
people ni Canada. Unless the country is pre.
pared to adopt the plan we have proposed, or
some other equally effective measures, to secure
the efficient and economical working ni both
railway systems and thereby ot only redue
the burden on the federal treasury but improve
the financial position oi the privately-owned
railway,-

MAY 24, 1939
I would ask honourable members to pay
particular attention to what follows:
-then the only courses that would be left would
be either to effect savings in national expenditure in other directions or to add still further
to the burdens under which the industries of
the country are suffering by the imposition of
yet further taxation. Failing the adoption of
one or other of these courses, and there are
obvious limits to their application, the very
stability of the nation's finances and the financial credit of the Canadian Pacific Railway will
be threatened, with serious consequences to the
people of Canada and to those who have invested
their savings in that railway.
Those are the solemn words chosen by all the
members of the committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask my
honourable friend whether that action was not
taken in 1933, when the royal commission was
investigating the matter?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I wish my honourable friend would be patient. I may not
have expressed myself very clearlyHon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am asking for
information.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -but I intended
to say that the quotation is taken textually
from the report of the Duff Commission of
1932. I added that that warning had been
adopted by each section of the committee as
expressing their own opinion. Otherwise, why
should it be in the main report and also in
the alternative report? It is there for absolutely no other purpose than to express what
may be regarded as the unanimous opinion
of the committee. The gravity of the situation is admirably expressed by an independent voice which should be heard throughout Canada.
What does that warning imply? That the
financial stability of the country is menaced
by the annual recurrence of Canadian
National deficits unless one of two things is
done. First, increased taxation. It is but
yesterday that the Hon. Minister of Finance
expressed regret that he was unable to lessen
the tax load which is breaking the back of the
nation, impeding the wheels of industry and
commerce, and aggravating unemployment.
To-day we are faced with the appalling figure
of a million of our people on relief. Is it
reasonable to believe that under those deplorable conditions taxation could be increased?
What man in either House would dare suggest
it to the country? No; increase of taxation
is out of the question.
The other course is to reduce national
expenditures. Who will be so courageous as
to make such a suggestion? Why, our
national expenditures have been expanding
for years past, and will continue to exoand.

423

For instance, who will dare propose that
expenditure on national defence be restricted?
The Government have guaranteed to the West
a minimum price on wheat, and they are
being asked to éxtend this concession to grain
growers in the other provinces. And why
should crop insurance not be extended to other
products of the farm? Who in the name of
equity would refuse a demand for similar
treatment? And unemployment insurance is
on the way. For years the central Government have invited the provincial governments
to pass concurrent legislation to provide for
insurance against unemployment, and some
of the provinces have already taken the necessary steps in that direction. When, in 1936,
the Government had the matter under consideration it was estimated that the federal
contribution to unemployment insurance would
be $52,000,000 a year.
I am confident honourable members will
agree with my contention that, on the one
hand, taxation cannot be increased and
that, on the other hand, national services
cannot be curtailed. The conclusion is inevitable that the financial structure of this country
cannot stand a continuation of Canadian
National Railway deficits.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My authority for
that statement is to be found in the warning given-by the Duff Commission, which, as
I have stated, is cited in both the main and
the alternative report. If my authority is
wrong, then of course I am wrong, as are also
all my colleagues, both those who are with
me and those who are against me. But is it
at all probable that twenty members of this
House, after a conscientious investigation
extending over two years, can be wrong in
their conclusion? I do not think so. That,
honourable members, is the basis for my
submission that the committee is unanimous
in its declaration that the financial structure
of Canada is menaced and cannot stand a
continuation of annual deficits on the operation of the Canadian National Railways.
May I examine somewhat briefly the main
report in the light of this quotation which
appears in both reports? For this purpose I
pass to the second part of the instructions to
the committee, that is, "to report as to the
best means of relieving the country from its
extremely serious railway condition and financial burden consequent thereto." For two
years we have carried on our inquiry assiduously and attentively. We have heard witnesses who had suggestions to make to us,
and we have tried to get from them all the

SENATE
wisdom that it was possible to elicit. Three
proposais were suggested to us: vnluntary cooperat ion, cnforced co-operation, unification.
I was surprised to hear rny honourable
frieod's remarks on voiuntary co-operation. We
met with some hope of iearning that voluntary
co-operation hiad bcen effective. What did we
flnd? I appeal to ail my colleagues to endorse
my statement that we found that affer six
years of voluntary co-operation the annual
saving amnounted to less than $2.000,000. That
was ai. I.ast y-ear we thirexv intô the vortex
$56.000.000 of new money. Surprised at such
a resuit, wc asked for the explanation. Wbat
did wc get? Let my colleagues of the coinnsittee consult their own memories. What
dici the railways say? Tie representative of
the Canadian National said co-operation had
been useless in the past and was hopeless for
the future. As honourable members know
verv well, time after time the witnesses of
the Canadian National rose and spoke. We
wcre eager to extend to thiens an opportuoity
to give us some sort of hope. But no l Under
co-operation they haci done ootbing in the
past, and fhey hieid out no hope for the
fu ture.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Danduraýnd) is really a marvclious man; I have
always thought su; but when he spoke a
moment ago I seemed to hear the voices of
a host of people, and among fbem I thougbt
I detccted a voice that we often beard in the
committee-a voice that cao speek at any
fime and say anything.

they had been allowed te, run aud had atteuded

wîth wbich they bave been worrying about this
co-operation, both railroads would be much
further ahead to-day.
In other words, tbe effect of what he says is-.I do not thiuk 1 arn exaggerating-that voluntary co-operation is a pure loss of time; sa,
we should forget it and allow both railways
to attend to their business. Yet, after declaring tbat the railway condition of tbis country
is sucb as to endanger the nation's financial
stability, my bhonourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) offers to the country as a
remedy somethihig which experience has shown
to be utterly useless, sometbing whicb a
Minister of the Government, wbo cannot speak
witbout the autbority of the wbole Goverament, cbaracterizes as a pure loss of time.
Now may 1 say a word with respect to tbe
alternative report? 1 sball be very brief. I
know I shall be followed by honourable senators who can defend that report mucb more
ably than I can.
There is one thiug which. I bave been for
a long time itchiug to say to tbis House.
Time and again, wben 1 have been defending
n policy wbicb 1 believed was tbe only salvation of the country in its preseut predicament,
some of my colleages bave said it was the
voire of tbe C.P.R. tbat was speaking. Tbat
was flot kind. WTorse still, it ivas flot truc. I
do flot so mucbi mind whether a man is kind to
me or not, butHou. Mr. MURDOCK: Would you turn
around? I cannot hear what you say. You
are speaking to the wall.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: So far as I kuow,
I neyer speak to the wall except perhaps when
I speak to people who will not listen to me.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would you mind
repeating what you said? 1 did not hear it.
Hlon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am reminded of
the little boy wbo said: "Do it again. Mama
didn't see you."'
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh! Oh!

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: However, I suppose
I must do it again. I said I resented very
much hearing some voice say, "0f course that
is the C.P.R. speaking,"' when I was supporting what I thought was a reasouable solution, and the only solution, of the problem.
in wbieh we are involved.
Some people have very short and very poor
memories, but 'I think that what I amn going
to read will be recognized by honourable
memrbers wbo are around me; at ail eveuts by
those who bonoured tbis House with their
presence in 1925. Listen to this resolution:

425

That both the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
the Canadian National Railways should be
placed under the management of a Board of
fifteen directors, five to be named by the Canadian Pacifie Railway, five to be named by the
Government, and these ten to choose five proven,
capable business men to complete the Board;
these last five direetors te hold office for ten
years, and to be removed oniy for cause.
The resolution continues:
The merging of the two railway systems for
purposes of operation and administration as
above will remove or dispense with duplication
iu railway tracks and rolling stock, in passenger
and freiglit services, in railway stations f romn
the Atlantic to the Pacific, in telegraph, express,
and other services, in offices, in accounting and
book-keeping, in numerous other speciel offices
and staffs, in administration boards, etc., etc.,
and thereby and otherwise save an enormous
amount of money to the country.
This wvas adopted unanimously by the Senate.
It continues:
Your committee is of the opinion that the
railway question is one of extreme importance
and of the utmost urgency; that the constantly
increasing public obligation on railway account
is approximately two million dollars per weekIt exceeded that last year.
tbat until this problemn is settled in soe
-nd
way which will reduce the present enormous
expenditure tbere eau be no relief fromn taxation
which is bearing su heavily on ail classesThose are almost the words of the Duif report.
-nor eau there be any enove towards the
reduction in rates and fares su essential to the
prosperity of every inhabitant of Canada.
That report, which carried with it a guarautee of dividends to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway shareholders, was passed unanimously"
by this House. To-day there is no question
of any guarantee whatsoever. The Canadian
Pacifie will take-what? It will take its fair
share of earnings and its fair share of whatever savings can be made; nothing else. Therefore the resolution passed by the Senate in
1925 was far more favourable to the Canadian
Pacifie.
What is the condition of our railways to-day?
Are conditions so changed that a scbeme of
that kind is not uecessary? Since 1925 the
Canadian National has iucreased the national
debt by one-third, and, what is worse, the
traffie on the railway, as bas been shown in
a clear and convincing manner, bas fallen
continuously since 1921, and is still falling.
My bonourable frieud, in bis report, bas gone
to the trouble of showiug to what an extent
traffie bas decreased, up to the present time.
Haîf the trains in passeuger service are carrying their fuil contingent of passengers; the
other haîf are carrying uobody at ail. In other
words, passesiger traffie bas fallen by 50 per
cent. And what about freight? Practically onethird bas gone by the board. Will it ever

return? Neyer, in my opinion. I may be
wrong, but I do flot think 1 arn.
In, vjew of these circumstances I ask: Has
anything happened since 1925 to justify anybody who put bis signature to the policy
then unanimously adopted by this Bouse in
withdrawing that signature? The conditions
of the rai]ways are worse; the financial conditions of the country are far worse; the emergency is much greater. Yet when one like
myseif makes bold to take up the policy of the
Senate in 1925 and defend it, some people are
unjust enough to impute motives that they
would regard as insulting if imputed to themselves.
The Canadian Pacific did flot agree with the
Senate at first. 1 was not surprised at that,
because it was on]y natural that that great
company should want to maintain its identity.
I remember that when 1 went to Europe
before the war I found that though in France
and other countries ail over the continent
very littIe was known about Canada, the
Canadian Pacific Railway was an old acquaintance. I can understand the determaination on
the part of the company to fight to the last
ditch to keep its identity. But from year to
year its directors saw traffic gradually
decreasing, and, although they were very
courageous and able, a time came when they
had to acknowledge that in this country
there was flot enough business for two railways. In this respect the problemn is very
simple, after aIl, and I make bold to say that
but for the political element it would be
settled in no time.
Righ't Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hlear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Tle Canadian
Pacifie found its business was dropping. Not
only were the demands for transportation of
goods insufficient to keep two railway companies going, but competition from motor cars
and trucks was eating into the company's
earnings more and more as time went on, and
one day the Canadian Pacifices direcýtors had
to take off their bats to the Senate and say,
"The Senate is right." That was a great
compliment to this Bouse, and it was no
reflection upon the company.
Now let us look at what we have been
warned would happen if unification were
adopted. Two cries of danger dominated ail
others. These cries had a certain political
significance, of course.
One was, "No
monopoýly for Canada." I must admit that
politically this had some menit. People who
have not studied the question are likely to be
frightened by the threat of a monopoly. But
what is the truth about this threat? A verv
Mon.

Mr-. BEAUBIIEN.

simple way to test whetlier the threat is well
founded or flot is to take a look at an
ordinary time-table, which may be got in any
railway office, containing a map of ail the
railway lines in the country. 0f course,
if it is a Canadian Pacifie time-table, that
company's lines will be more prominently
displayed; and similarly, if it is a Canadian
National time-table, that company's lines
will be given prominence. But ail the lines
are there. What do we sce when, we look at
such a time-table? We see that fewer than
5,000 miles of lines out of a total of 42,000
miles are parallel. After having heard representatives of both railways at our committee,
I know that it would be out of the question
to abolish more than haîf of those 5,000 miles,
and the probahility is that a much smaller
proportion than one-haîf could be dispensed
with. Canadian National officiaIs say that
2,400 miles could be aihandoned. That is,
only about 5 per cent of the total railway
mileage represents duplication that could be
abandoned.
If you study the map a little more closely
you will find that 95 per cent of our population is to-day, as it bias been for years,
tributary to one railway. Honourable members will sce that the Canadian Pacifie possesses
monopoly in the Kootenay district of British
Columbia, in southern Alberta, in southwestern
Saskatchewan, in an area south of the Canadian National Transcontinental line from
Nipigon as fan as Sudbury, in the territory
between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, on. the
so-called short line between Sherbrooke and
Saint John, New Brunswick, andl in southwestern Nova Scotia; while the Canadian
National possesses monopoîy between Edmonton and Prince Rupert, between Edmonton
and Kamloops, in much of northenn Saskatchewan and Manitoba, in the territory between
Winnipeg and Quebec, in the Lake St. John
district of Quebec, in the northern portions
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and in
Prince Edward Island. Cenerally speaking,
the railways compete for traffic in the more
populous centres. But I think no one wilI
contcst the truth of my statement that 95
per cent of our people are dependent upon one
railway. Well, diîning the two sessions that
our committee bas been sitting, bias any
honourable member heard a single complaint
about poor service from the people who are
served by one railway?
Under unification there would be this saine
monopoly. In the cities people would have
the use of both railways.
That is the
advantage, which anyone wlio bias been in
Great Bnitain wilI adImit, of leaving a city
by one sv-tenî andl returning by the other.

MAY 24, 1939
In any event, is it in the power of our
railways to exercise monopoly in a way to hurt
the public? Everybody knows the companies
are completely under the control of the Board
of Transport Commissioners. Not a line can
be abandoned, not a rail can be lifted, not a
train can be cut off, not a single service can
be discontinued, not a fare or rate can be
increased without permission from that
tribunal.
Some people say it would be a terrible
shock to our population to have to live under
monopoly. Yet all our communities, from
ocean to ocean, are living under monopoly.
My honourable friend the leader of this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) remembers
better than I do the time when Montreal had
two tramway systems, two gas companies,
two electric ligh't companies and two telephone
companies, but now we have a complete
monopoly in each of those instances. We
were not compelled to accept the change, but
we accepted it because it suited us, because
we knew it promised better and cheaper
service. When there were two tramway
systems in Montreal, if you wanted to travel
farther than one line ran, you had to buy a
second ticket to travel on the other line. And
in former days, if you wanted a telephone in
your office or home, you had to make a choice
between La Compagnie de Téléphone des
Marchands and the Bell Telephone Company,
and if you desired to carry on a conversation
with someone who was a subscriber of the
company which was not serving you, it was
necessary to pay an additional charge. No
one will deny that monopoly has improved
the service.
In this respect Montreal is typical of all
cities and towns all over the country.
Our people have their meals cooked
by fuel furnished by a monopoly, they subscribe to a monopolistic telephone service,
and every day they ride in street cars or
buses operated by another monopoly. Whatever way it is looked at, this threat of
monopoly is like a harmless gas-filled bag.
If you prick it, the gas escapes and the bag
collapses and falls to the ground. Yet, if we
are to listen to my honourable friend the
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
we must take it that our people would feel
very uneasy once they stepped on to a train
which was under the control of a monopoly.
For people who several times a day use a
tramway under monopoly, would it be
appalling once a week or month to use a
railway also under monopoly? Is there
anything in that view? I wave it aside.
I come now to the other alleged danger,
which in my opinion is a horse of a different
colour. I refer to political domination. My
71498--28à

427

honourable friend once waxed very indignant
about that: he said, "We will have no political domination." Well, what is the position
to-day? I shall have to ask the House to be
kind enough to let me pass rapidly over part
of the ground I have covered on a previous
occasion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There were nine
Conservatives to seven Grits on the committee. Political domination.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not understand my honourable friend. Is he asking a
question?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understood the
honourable gentleman asked a question about
the position to-day. On the committee we
had nine Conservatives voting for one report,
against seven Grits voting for another report.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend will see how stupid I am.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would not say
that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Oh, yes, I have to
admit that. I was intending to talk about
political domination by the unions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg your pardon.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I did not want to
discuss the attitude of committee members.
I simply desired to remind honourable members of something that happened last year
which it seems to me will have serious consequences for the whole country. In the
beginning of 1938 the railway unions insisted
upon an increase of Il per cent in wages.
The Government would be expected to defend
the interests of the taxpayers, to prevent
any unnecessary expenditures. Well, let us
see if the railway workers needed an increase.
I have already cited figures given before our
committee by Mr. Chase, a very intelligent
gentleman, who I believe represented the
running trades. He said that locomotive
engineers on passenger trains-I think that
was the category, though I may be wrongreceived an average annual income of $3,205,
and that the average of all railway workers
was $1,550. It struck me that this second
figure was a very high one in comparison with
the average wage of all workers in Canada.
I thought it would be fairer to make a comparison with the next privileged class of
workers; so I looked at an advance report on
manufacturing industries for 1937, published
by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, and
containing the latest figures available. As
1937 was a better year than 1938, the 1937
figures must be considered relatively high. I

428

SENATE

found that this second privileged class of
manufacturing workers earned an average of
$1,093.
Then I was curious ta learn whether the
cost of living in 1938 was high or low. The
index figure, wlsjch in 1913 had been at 100,
had increased in the hey-day of 1929 to 157-8,
but by 1938 it had fallen 25 points, ta, 132,
which I calculateld was a decrease of more
than 17, but less than 20 per cent.
When the demand was made for the
inerease in wagcs, did the Government say to
tihe Canadian Nýational
"Iniva~
"orader
ta give you your prescrnt pay, which is on the
averaga one-third higher than the avarage paid
ta the second prix iaoged class of workers in
Canada, tIse public treasuiry lias to put up

Did tise Covarroment

purposes. Why should we hide our faces in
8bame and remain silent on this matter? The
Government know that 1,200 votes ini this
county, 1,500 votes in another county, 1.800
in saine other county and 2,000 ini another
county will be sufficient to secure the return
of their candidates. I arn reminded of the
religious wars in Europe in medieval times,
when a duke or baron would reward his mercenary troops by allowing them to plunder
any cities that fell into their bands. There is,
however, this difference between ancient and
modern usage: to-day the railway workers do
flot do the plundering; the Government are
kind enough to do it for them 1 This hidden but
transparent unholy alliance must go. Unification wili do away with it by piacing both railways under a board of strong men unremovabie
except for cause.
I intend now to refer briefly to the evidence
adduced on behaif of unification before the
committee. The Canadian Pacific submitted to
us a statement which they had prepared for
the Duif Commission in 1932. It was an
estimate of the savings that wouid resuit from
unification of tbe two, roads. The statement,
prepared by their engineering and accounting
staffs, showed a saving of some $75,000,000 odd
on the level of the traffie of 1930. At the
request of our committee this estimate was
brought down to the level of 1937. As I recail,
tbis amended statement showed estimated
savings of $59,000.000 with an abandonment of
about 2,000 miles of maiiway, and estimated
savings of $56,000,000 without any rail abandonmient at ail. I may say tbat the estimate
pmepamed for the Duif Commission was submitted to the auditor-general of the Great
Nomthem, which had just camied out an amalgamation with another railway. He examined
the estimate and said it was easonable and
mealizable. Before the committee this estimate
was explained and exemplified by seventeen
committees of Canadian Pacifie officiais, each
taking a part of the estimate, dividing it
into sections. and subsections and building up
on the one hand the united system and laying
aside and computing ail savings that could be
made.
On the basis of a united road the railway officiaIs assumed thiat cars would 'be
fully loaded, and would be hauled over the
shortest routes, and they found that considemable economies were possible. In order
to evaluate the economy at every step, they
worked out the savings in ternis of reduced
car and train miles. 0f course, if you have
cars fully -loaded you need fewer cars and
consequentiy fewer men. Their esiculations
showed a reduction in passenger and feight
serviceS of 14 alnd 15 per cent respectively.
T-hey applied that measuring stick wherever

429

possible. For instance, tbey said, "If we
bave fewer locomotives and cars we shail
require fewer yards and repair shops and a
lesser quantity of fuel and lubricants, and it
wiil flot be necessary to bave ais large a
personnel." That simple mnethod was applied
to $50,000,000 of the $75,000,000 of savings
contained in the 1932 estimate. As ta the
balance of $25,000,000, to which. the yardstick
could not 'be applied, they said that, for
instance, if you bave two offices in one city,
by eliminating one you would save one-haîf of
the expense, but of course you would bave
to make allowance for a greater amount of
work being pemfommed by the subsisting
office.
This evidence was met by what I might
temmi "the defence" in a manner designed to
discredit it. A slight error bere or there was
magnified so as to cast doubt on the figures
as a whole. Three major objections were
umged. First it was said, "Your calculations on
car mileage savings are not ight." There was
not s tittie of evidence in support of that
objection, and, speaking as a iawyer, I do not
attach muc*h importance to it. Then it was
said, "You bave no ight to apply Canadian
Pacifie unit costs ta Canadian National operations, because the two uines are not comparable." The Canadian Pacifie retorted: "We
do not. Wbat we do is to apply the Canadian
Pacifie unit costs to the united road."
Righ't Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They said, "We do
not apply it to the Canadian National." Why
should the unit costs of the Canadian Pacifie
not be .imposed on a moad having the advantages and facilities of unification?
The third objection was, "Oh, yes, but you
do not take into account the immense savings
we bave effected since 1930." Well, tbose
savings of a permanent nature were not more
than $4,800,000. In fact I think I am perhaps
stating the figure a littie too high.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

Too high.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
AIl the other
economies made by the Canadian National
were due ta fluctuations of business. According to the Canadian National the Canadian
Pacifie evidence wvas not correct, but there
was nothing to show that the Canadian
National economies were not due ta declining
trade. Everybody will recognize immediately
that when trade falis off the railways-have to
make economies and reduce their costs. But
if trade increases and costs ise, the railways
will then have a full opportunity ta mnake the
economies which the Canadian Pacifie Railway had in mind.

SENATE
Now, only one witness made a frontal
attack on the evidence of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway. He attacked it from A to Z, and
did nlot mince words. 1 refer to Mr. Fairweather, a very versatile and very clever
gentleman-I should say almost too claver.
Mr. Fairweather simply said that oconomies
of the kind reforred to were out of the question; that tbey were impossible. When ho
was asked if the Canadian National had not
made an ostimate of the same kind, what
did we discover? We found that in 1932 Mr.
F'airweather had been asked to estimato the
mavings from the unification of the two roads.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

In 1931.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am sorry. In
1931. Every facility was placed at bis disposaI
-ail the books of the Canadian National, al
the information of the Canadian Pacificeverything. So Mr. Fairweather made an
estimate. And wbo do you think asked him
to do this? It was not the royal commission, for it had not thon been croated, but bis
own prosident. There was no roason why
Mr. Fairweather should make any errer in
advising bis president. At aIl events, Mr.
Fairweather made an estimate which corroborates in a most formidable manner the
estimate of 859,000,000 made by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway on the basis of the traffic
level of 1937. When Mr. Fairweather was
a.sked what he bad ta say about that, be
replied: "Oh, that is purely theoretical; it
could aeyer be put into practice except with
aà supine public and a spinolesa personnel."
That is wbat
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
he said before the Duif Commission.
Yes. He had
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
changed bis mind.
Ho said that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Han. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will lot yau
have Mr. Fairweather as he is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- Ho is a very
bright officor.
Han. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do not forget, he
spoke of a supino public.
Now, I have already shown that the railways
cannot do anything to the public. The Transport Board plays the part of watch-dog, and
without its permission not one lino, not one
car, not one service can ho removed; nor
can rates be uncroased. It is laughable, therefore, ta hear Mr. Fairweather speak of a
supine public.
He referrod also ta a spineless personnela personnel to whomn conditions have been
oifered such as nover before have been known
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

ini this country; conditions undor which not
one of the employees could suifer in any way,
shape or form. Yet that was bis answer.
Now lot us go a little furtbor. My honourable friend bas spokon of the enormous
amounts that could be saved by voluntary
co-oporation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Earnest voluntary co-operation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: AIl right, earnest
voluntary co-operation. And there I could
almost detect, the voice of Mr. iFairweather.
We askod hima wbat ho thougbt about coaporation, and what was bis answer? First
of aIl ho said wo could savo $35,000,000; thon
ho cbanged bis mind and said, "Oh, I tbink we
can save $24,000,000." Ho was stopping down.
Thon ho said: "I sbould like to change my
mind again. I think tho saving is going to
be 810,000,000." 0f course we were all a
little oxercised ovor that. We askod him if
that was an estimato or a guoss, and ho said,
"Oh, it is a sciontifie guoss." It was a guoss.
Mr. Fairweathor is certainly very clever ta
ho able ta contradiet bimself sa flagrantly and
stili stand beforo us as a witness. In ordor
to do anything like that, ano requiros ahility
and a little somothing else as well.
That we have bofore the Senate to-day a
formidable body of evidonce in favour of
unification, I do not think anybody wiil deny,
and I ask honourable anembors ta refleot and
say whetber under the circumstancos the argumont of common senso should nat ho applied.
Here are two enormous industries, both working practically baif-time in the same field.
For twonty years business bas been decreasing.
Is it not rational ta believe that if those
twa industries wore contracted ta a size comnmonsurato witb the business ta, be done there
would ho groat ecanomny?
A furtbor argument in favour of unification is ta ho fou'nd in what bas been done
in Great Britain. What my honourable friand
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) bas said is no disparagomont of the systein adopted there,
whore one bundrod and twenty railways were
merged into, four, and whero those four are
on the way ta becoming one.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: They have 20,000
miles of lino divided among four railways.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am thankful ta
my honourablo friend for remninding me of
that. In a country with 42,000,000 people
and a railway mileage of 20,000 miles it haa
been found necessary ta reduce the number
of railways from one hundred and twenty ta
four. LIn a country like ours, with 42,000 miles
of railway and 11,000,000 people, we do not

MAY 24, 1939
think it is necessary ta make any contraction
at ail of our railway services. We let the
railwaye continue Vo run throughout the
country and provide double the services
required.
Anather reasan is aur own experience.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Great Britain
is only a postage stamp compared ta Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I thank my lionourable frlend for helping me in my argument.
Anuther reason, which should flot be neg.
lected, is this. Ca-operation, which, as 1 say,
involves the samne principle as unification, has
up ta naw, whe'rever it has been put into
effect, produced an economy of 33 per cent.
Still these efforts towards co-operation,
especially in the matter of block trains, are
handicapped by duplications of terminais and
yards and ather services, la it nat rational
to say that if yau obliterate duplication camnpleteiy you make a saving of at least
20 per cent? Honourable gentlemen may not
knaw what that would mean. On the basis
of the trafflc level of 1930 it would mean
870,000,000; on the basis of the traffic level
of 1937 it would mean $54,000,000.
In 1925 this House-not the Canadian Pacifie
R.ailway--shawed the way to the on.ly remedy
for or railway juls. A tremendaue amaunt
of information supporting unification has been
gathered together and is available ta the Government at a paltry cost. What is 625,000 or
$50,000 in comparison with aur railway deficit?
It is less than one-third of a day's loss on the
Canadian National. This information is easyr
ta reach; aur goad friend Colonel Biggar hias
moulded the key ta the vault where it is kept,
and the Government could send in accounting
clerks ta verify the figures, and engineers, with
slide rules, ta check formulas and make such
an investigation as wauld be necessary in
order ta enlighten, not the members of the
committee who signed this report, but others,
and even the Governmnent themseives, wha
wili have ýta deal with this xnatter. My hionourable friend may be very glad ta have
his hands strengthened. If it is proved that
we are wrong as ta unification, unification will
be buried for ever; if we are right, should
the Gaverument nat know it?
The Governmnent may tbink they have an
easy road ta travel, but I want ta warn themn
that befare long they may be aearehing for
same econamies ta enable them ta help somes
of our people who do not receive suéh good
wages as railway workers do. The Government may be looking for money ta help out
farmers of the province of Quebec, for instance
or of Ontaria, whose credit has disappeared.
I want ta predict something else. Thie
Government, I suppose, are flot paying attention ta our work here, but the people at large

431

are. Some day the people will refiect that an
average of $50 per family is being paid out
every year an accaunt of the Canad-ian
National Railwaye' defleit, and -that much of
this money could be saved. They will realize
the fact that because of aur systemi of indirect
taxation everybody bas ta cantribute ta make
up this deficit, and that the burden does net
faîl upon rich people alone, for there is only
one class of people in the country who do
nat pay, namely, the paupers who live exclusively an charity. Some day public opinion
will wake up, and then the Gavernment's
policy will change as quickly as the weather
vane changes in response ta the breeze.
In conclusion let me say that the task we
are performing to-day is not a pleasant one.
We have party ties, and it is painful ta do
what we are doing. But surely in this Huse,
with its exalted position, there must be carresponding responsibility. Our duty, in a matter
as seriaus as the one we are d.iscussing to-day,
must first of all be ta aur country. At aIl
events, and above ail, let not the people lose
confidence in the Senate. There are a great
many persans who consider themseives ciever
and who believe nothing can equal the playing
of polities. I have here an article whîch I
found in an Ottawa newspaper to-day. It
might help towards the realization that, after
ahl, in our day political ability does by no
means count as much as the courage ta da aur
duty. But I fear that if I read the article it
would cause some of my honourable f riends
across the way toa cruel an impression.
At 6 o'ciock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Han. A. D. MeRAE: Honourahie senatars,
in order ta relieve me from the necessity of
reading it, I ask the approval of the bouse
that I may place on Hansard as a preface ta
my remarks my proposai ta the Special Railway Committee of the Senate. It will be
the basis for my talk to-day. I think honourable senators are quite -familiar with it.
Soine Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Thank you.
(This is the proposai submitted by Hon.
Mr. Mcbae.)
Proposal ta Special Railway Committee of
the Senate.
I approach aur prablim with a sincere regard
for the public intereet and in the hope that
this comnmittee, after twa years' effort, can
arrive at a report ta the Senate which will
be helpful in the present railway situation. For
these reasons only, I feel impelled ta submnit
ta the committee my proposai.
I know that Senate committees are supposed
ta be free fromn Party considerations, but,
rightly or wrongly, there has crept aut ta the

SENATE
country the impression that politics are playing
a part in the conduct of our proceedings. I
am sure that in these very difficuit times many
honourable senators, like myself, have entirely
lost their party passions, and that with every
member of this committee party passions have
at least been greatly subdued. I am sure you
will all agree with me that the only thing we
are here to consider is, What is in the best
interest of the country as a whole? It is
therefore highly important that any report
this committee may make should be high above
and divorced from any charge of party politics,
and also free of the charge of being influenced
by either railway system.
In the beginning of our work the only benefit
I could see which might come out of our inquiry
was educational; that is, to give the facts to
the country. We should now, however, recognize
that notwithstanding that our report would
ordinarily be confined to the particular matter
referred to us, as our inquiry proceeded and the
Press gave publicity to the hearings, aided by
the discussion of many individual citizens
throughout the country, a large section of the
public have come to regard our inquiry as one
which should result in the solution of our railway problem. They therefore expect, in fact
demand, a report from this committee which
wili be definite and concrete and at least give
promise of a more complete evaluation of the
entire railway situation than it is possible for
this coimittee to bring in.
Nevertheless, I honestly believe that w ith
this responsibility resting on our shoulders, any
failure to bring in at this time

a reconmen-

dation which will point the way to an impartial
judgment, free froin any poiltical considerations
or railway influences, wil leave us subject to
the most violent attacks by those who to-day
are agitating against our democratie form of
government, and more particularly those who
are attacking the Seiate of Canada. Our failure
to come to a constructive finding after our two
years' work, I feel, would be a discredit to
every member of the committee and would
greatly injure the standing of the Senate itself.
The probleim is now on the doorstep of Parliament. To endeavour to sidetrack it, to avoid
it or to bring in an innocuous report, would be
little short of calamitous and furnish a clear
example of the inefficiency of Parliament itself.
It therefore seems imperative to me that our
committee should come to some constructive
recommendation which promises an impartial
inquiry into our entire steam-railway problem.
Our inquiry has been almost entirely confined
to the savings which would result from unification. As I have often said, I am opposed to
unification as presented to the committee. I
am certain that, as matters stand to-day. the
great majority of Canadians are opposed to
unification. That proposal, even to those w-ho
desire it. is therefore impossible of fulfilment
at this time.
The larger problem of the future of our steam
railways bas been barely touched. The financial
picture, except as affecting savings in operation,
bas also not been enquired into. Many other
correlated factors remain to be disclosed.
Collateral issues, such as unemployment, have
also to be considered and passed upon before
anything like an intelligent, safe opinion can
be arrived at as to how the country should
deal with this all-important matter.
There is much need to inform the public with
regard to the unfortunate position in which
our railways, in common with railways in the
United States, find themselves. It is my opinion
Hon.

Mr. MeRAE.

that the ever-growing competitive transportation
services have put our steam railways, operated
as they are to-day and on the present rate
structure, entirely out of the class of "profitearners," for all time. The march of time
knows no retreat.
At present some people
believe unification would be the end of our railway deficit. This is very far from the fact.
Others think that, given time, with our Canadian National RaiIways not interfered with
and with a revival of business, deficits will
disappear.
This, too, is equally erroneous.
Everyone is agreed that railway rates cannot
be advanced-a procedure which is usually
followed where a business cannot make both
ends meet. In view of the present financial
position of the Dominion, obviously the present
railway situation cannot continue indefinitely.
The judgment day is certain to arrive.
The real question which still remains, after
a review of the entire railway situation, is,
What can be donc in the national interest to
relieve the taxpayer?
When a solution is
finally proposed it must be one which will have
the support of the majority of the Canadian
people; hence the nîecessity of an impartial
report which will carry conviction.
It is with a full appreciation of the situation
that I submit to you for your consideration my
proposal, ohich is as follows:
That we recommend to the Government the
appointnent of a board of three eiiniient Canadian judges, the cliairmtan to bc a member of
the Suprenie Court of Canada.
hlie duty of this board will b to inquire
into aIl matters affecting our steaimt-railw ay
problem, their financial, operatiiig, labour and
similar correlated factors;
To review all the evidence from and including
the Duff Royal Couission of 1932 and all the

evidenîce available takeln before Senate committees since that time, including the present
special Senate railway inquiry;
To consider the present position of our steam
railways and the probability of their making
necessary eariogs in the future;
To report to the Goverinfent what, in its
opinion, keeping the national interest in view,
could be done to improve the railway situation
in Canada;

The board to be empowered to engage counsel
and such other expert advice as it may find
necessary to enable it to arrive at a conclusion
on any of the varions points which may arise
in its consideration of our steam-railway
problem.
The members of the committee will note that
I have endeavoured, in my proposal, to accomplish the following:
First-To place this question before a board
far above any reproach of political or railway
influences.

Second-The findings of this judicial body
will carry weight with Canadians generally.
Canadians, quite properly, have a high regard
for our courts, and would have a similar respect
for the findings of this board of judges.
Third-The conclusions of this board would
cover all essential points which go to make up
the present railway problem and its possible
solution or improvement.
Fourth-The expense of this board would be
very small indeed, compared with the amount
at stake. Practically all of its work would be

MAY 24, 1939
donc in the city of Ottawa. The ernployment
of counsel, familiar with the voluminous evidence
on file, would greatly facilitate its efforts. The
board would only require such expert advice
as it might find necessary in order to enable it
to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on any
point in doubt. This item of expense would
be the minimum the situation necessitated.
Fifth-The board would inquire into the problem as a whole, taking into account what is best
for the nation and not one section or aspect
alone, of the issue, which. is most difficult to
judge separated f rom the whole. Its findings
in this way would be for the general good and
well-being of Canadians.
Sixth-The findings of the board would
undoubtedly prove of inestimable value to the
Government of the day in dealing with any
eventuality which might occur in our railway
situation.
May I say, as a member of the committee,
after attending its meetings for the last two
sessions, I have corne te the firm conviction
that this question must be lifted out of the
atmosphere in which we now find it, if anything
worth while is te corne eut of our inqu'iry.
The exigencies of the situation demand that
we place this question before the highest and
most unbiased judicial body the country cao
command, whose judgment on the entire railway problem will be accepted by the Canadian
people.
It is with this hope that I submit for your
consideration this proposal.
I welcome the op'portunity of speaking early
in this debate se, that honourable menobers
of the special committee, as well as honourable
members of the House, m.ay have the eppertunity te criticize my suggestions, ail of which
I hoe will mako for a clear understanding
by the publie of the issues involved in our
railway problemn and the different points of
view by which we arrive at our conclusions.
I trust this discussion will net only 'bring
aibout a truer understanding of the situation,
but will ma.terially help te crystallize public
opinion.
I would net wish my remanks to-day te be
considered critical of either railway system.
Bath systems have made mistakes. But what
individual deing 'business bas not made
mnistakes? The reasons for, or the extent of,
these mistakes are net now worth the time
required in referring te them. It is ail watei7
over the dam. We have the resui-ts before us
in our railway de-ficits. Nething more need
cencern us at this time.
I feel that our raiiways have done very wel
in the difficult situation which bas prevailed.
The resuits cempare very favourably indeed
with the resuits cf similar- railways in the
United States, where tihere is a much greater
density of population and traffie, and where
higher rail'way rates prevail.
Honourable senators wili, I arn sure, be
interested in a short review of the raiiway
situation in the United States, where conditions are very similar to conditions in Canada.

433

A Wa.shing-ton dispatch states that one-third
of the rail mileage in the United States is in
banJcruptcy or receivership; that the trouble
with the United States railways, in addition
te diminishing 'business and over-capitalizatien, is the increase in wages and taxes, which
have doubled since 1899; that there is little
possibility of any great gain in revenue; that
capitalization must be based en earning
capacity or the roads will continue te crumrble
and fait as they have clone in the past.
It reports Senater Wheeler, of Montana,
as suggesting legislation which would create
a new court with exclusive jurisdiction over
bankruptcy and receivership.
This court
would have full authority over re-organizatiens and might materially reduce the face
value of railway securities, se that they would
fairly refleet th~e earning capacity of the
re-organized cempanies. This. it says. saveurs
.of confiscation and is being bitterly attacked
by in.surance companies, educational endowments, and other institutions which have
railway bonds in their portfolios. Prier te
the dýepression it was said that these savings
institutions held most of the United States
railway securities, estimated at that time at
about twenty billien dollars.
The report gees on te say that the railway
is a national institution which must net ibe
allowed te perish, that government ownership
is neot popular in that ceuntry, but that
government handouts te the railway companies
will accomplish little.
That gives very t.ersely the general situation.
A reliable report I have before me states
there are 141 Class 1 railways in the United
States. These are the railways whose annual
gross revenue exceeds one million dollars.
In 1938. ail Class 1 railways had S509.000,00
income available for fixcd charges. which

totalled

$615,000,000. Roughlv,

their

net

earnings were $100,000,000 short of fixed
charges. To be exact, they earned, colictively, 82 per cent of fixed charges.
The interesting part ef this statement is
the mileage abandoned in the last eight
years. At the end of 1937 the United States
had 414,572 miles, as compared with 429,054
miles at the end of 1929-a decrease of 3
per cent in eighit years. An interesting comment in the statement is that the abandenment of railways there bas been hampered
by the inability of the railways te take any
such
action
without the
approval
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission.
Characteristically, it says that the Interstate
Commerce Cemmission bas shown reluctancs
te grant applications for mileage curtailment.
The Interstate Commerce Commission occupies
the samne position in the United States as cmr
Transport Board in Canada, and it is worthy

434

of note that these authorities in both countries are showing the same disposition flot
to permit the abandonoment of mileage.
I have hiere a staternant as to the devaluation of the current assets of steam railways,
which may be very interesting to honourable
senators. It is taken from a report issued Iast
summer by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States. It says that the
net currant assets of Class 1 railways in the
United States at the end of 1930 ware approximately one hundred and twenty million dollars,
whereas at the end of 1938 the currant liabilities of the same railways excaeded their current
assets by over one billion dollars, which would
mean the wiping out of one billioýn, one
hundred and twenty million dollars of assets
in eight years. If these figures are correct, such
a dehacle in the principal transportation system.
in one country surpasses comprehension.
We can better undarstand the situation of
one railway which goas to, make up these
tremendous figures, a great railway whieh you
ahl know, the New York Central. A few
yaars ago it paid big dividends. Now it is
losing twenty million dollars par annum.
While I arn dealing with foreign railways
I might give to the Huse some pertinent
detail as regards the situation in Argantina.
Argentina has recently addad to, its government ownership the Argentine Transandine
Railway, approximately 160 kilometers in
length. The outstanding dtbt of this railway
was £1,175,000.
The purchase price was
£75,000 in cash plus £675,000 of 4 per cent
state railway bonds. It will ha noted that
this settlemeot was, rougbly, 64 per cent of
the ýrailway's outstanding indebtednass. The
acquisition of the Cordoba Central Railway
of Argentina, 960 kilometers, is said to be
still in the negotiation stage. Tha purchase
price proposed is slightly under £10,000,000,
whereas the par value of outstanding debt is
£20,550,000. Here again it will ha noted that
the proposai is to pay 48 per cent of the
outstanding debt. Apparently Argentina is
faced with the same railway problam as every
other country, and has decided ta take over
the railways gradually and to operate them
under govarnment ownarship. At the present
time about 25 per cent of the Argentine
mileage is owned and operated by the Government. Recex4t press dispatches reported Argentina placing in Germany a large order for
Diesel angines for the Argentine railways;- so,
apparantly, the Government are taking steps
to renovate the railways and bring them up to
date.

It appears that aven Germany is having
railway troubles. A Berlin dispatcb of March
16 last says:

I have occupied quita a little of your tima
in the hope of showing you that the steamrailway situation is pretty much the sama ail
ovar the world; and, as I said in my earlier
remarks, I think our railways bave done very
well undar the circumstances.
The main difficulty in the staam-railway
situation on this continent is that the business
is a waning or diminisbing one, Iosing out
in the march of progress. Compatitive transportation services by truck, bus, motor-car
and latterly the aeroplane, have in the aggregaVa made fatal inroads into the revenue of
our Canadian railways. The Panama Canal
and improved lake transportation hava aIso
played their part in our decreasad railway
earnings. I arn not one of thosa who balieve
that undue hindrance should ha placed on
these new transportation services, which make
for efficiancy and convenience in handling
the business of the country, in ordeir that
some of this business may ha returnad to
the railways. 'I do flot tbink the Canadian

no hope for permanent improvement in the
steam-railway situation under present conditions. That is the way I see it.

Somor Ilon. SELNATO1IS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MeRAIL,
A casual rot -iew of the
balance shoot of the Canadian Pacifie for last
vear would indicate that assots aggregating
abouit SI50,000.000, with oarnings of S7.363ý0û0,
are quite separate from the railway. and are
flot, a part of the unification proposal.* The
unified plan applies only te the Canadian
Pacifie linos ini Canada and dees not include
ocean anI coastal steamshlips, miscellaneous
ix estiion ts, ruorigages, insurance fund investment, deferred payrnents on lands and townsites, and unsold lands and other properties,
ai of which we should not bo far afleld in
estimating at S150,O00,000. It doos nlot appear
that the proposai includes the curreot assets
of the company, being largoly its w-orking
capital. aggregating about S50,000,000.
As an instance of the difflculty in arriving
at, a fair conclusion as to the balance shoot,
I migliht mention the, share holdings of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway in the Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company. On page 29
of the railwayls report for last year xxiii bo
found reference to the Consolidated. Mining
and Smelting holdings, under the beading
"Par value or principal amount." Here you
flnd this investment carried on the books nf
the railxvay at $8,412,500.
It is generally
understood that the Canadian Pacifie con-trols
this great mining corporation. By reference
to the dividends roceived for 1938 as compared
with the 'previous year, which are shown on
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

page 7 of the report, under the heading
" Other income," the exact shareholdings of
the Canadian Pacifie can be arrived at. These
figures disclose that it owned 1,682,500 shares
of Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company out of a total outstanding capital of
3,277,335 shares, or 51-s per cent of the issued
capital. Taking the present market price of
Consolidated
Mining, as quoted on the
Toronto Exchange last week, at $40 a share,
we find t.hat the holdings of the Canadian
Pacifie in this company, while carried on the
books at $8,4t12,500, have a market value of
$67,000,000. Here is a nice little reserve of
about $60,000,000 put away for a rainy day.
It furnishes a very definite answer to those
iwho say that the Canadian Pacifie cannot
carry on.
In fairness to the Canadian Pacifie let me
say. 1 qîmite appreciate that while these assets
were acquired from tho earnings of the railway, they arc quite aside from the railway
operation itsoîf. The company's ýpiopo-,ql is
te put, into the tinified railway corporation only

may be sliglîtly incorrect, but thev will be
sufficiently aceurate for our consideration.
I may say te the House that I do net think
the statements of eithor of our railway
systems present a truc pieture sueh as would
be diselosed by a business institution wbich
was desireus of safeguarding future annual
statements of the eompany. I have long felt
that under the extreme necessity of reducing
deficits and putting on the best financial face
possible our railways bave net made ample

MAY 24, 1939
provision for depreciation. And in no instance
have they made any provision for obsolescence,
a process of devaluation of assets of railways
which is travelling at a very rapid pace today, and which, if given due consideration,
would present a very much more unfavourable
picture than the deficits now disclose.
I think I have said enough on the unification plan to show that if we are ever to
consider unification, and if the public are
expected ever to approve of it, a much more
complete and detailed proposal must be
offered than the one which was placed before
the committee. It was certainly a skeleton
proposal which we were expected to approve,
and so far as I was concerned it was too
limited for me to pass judgment upon it.
In any event, the Government would have to
use the greatest care and go into details fully
before committing the country to any partnership of the nature proposed.
Now I come to voluntary co-operation. Six
years' effort to attain voluntary co-operation
between our two railway systems has proved
that it is impracticable and impossible. Six
years ago I spoke and voted against the
legislation brought down by the Bennett
Government with this object in view. I
expressed my lack of confidence as forcibly
as I could when the Act under which our
railways are still endeavouring to co-operate
was brought in by the present Government.
We have had both railways before Senate
committees at least three times, I think,
in the last five years. Every effort bas been
made, so far as Parliament is concerned, to
press our railways to get results. What are
the facts? Annual savings to date aggregate
only $860,000 for both roads. Evidence
showed that if all matters considered up ta
date and agreed to were approved by the
Transport Board the total savings would be
somewhat less than $2,000,000 a year for
both roads, or, roughly, $1,000,000 for each
system. These savings are before compensation to displaced labour, as recently authorized
by legislation, is deducted.
Surely nothing more is necessary to show
the hopelessness of this effort of co-operation,
the savings from which are a trifle compared
with the increase in deficits. After five years'
pressure from Senate committees and by the
Government, backed up by public opinion,
in an attempt to get our railways to co-operate
on savings and on avoidance of duplication,
the result obtained for our National Railways at the moment is less than one per cent
of their annual deficit. If any member of
our committee still bas any hope for successful voluntary co-operation, I should consider
him among the world's greatest optimists. I
say to this honourable House that the system

of voluntary co-operation promises no solution of our railway problem. You might as
well try to mix oil and water as try to get
our two competing systems to co-operate
voluntarily. That method will never produce
any substantial savings. It just cannot.
We had very little evidence this year with
regard to compulsory co-operation. I think
that plan is generally regarded as unwise, as
it would interfere with the rights of the
private company and might well place on the
Government and the Parliament of Canada
an implied responsibility for any unfortunate
development in the affairs of the private
company resulting from legislation by Parliament. It is conceivable it might result in the
country having to take over the Canadian
Pacific. In the end it would certainly force
amalgamation, perhaps on a basis not favourable ta Canada.
I need hardly remind the House that we
attempted by legislation to enforce a fair
settlement with the Grand Trunk Railway
instead of allowing matters to follow their
natural course. In liquidation the country
would undoubtedly have bought in the railway at much less than we paid for it, and we
should then have had no complaints from
shareholders. They understand that procedure.
But with the object of being eminently fair
and avoiding complications, legislation was
passed referring the matter to arbitration,
with the result that the Government took
over the guaranteed stock and debenture stock
of that railway, some $216,000,000. The common as well as the first, second and third
preferred shares, aggregating $180,000,000, were
washed out. As these shares came after the
guarantee by the Grank Trunk in connection
with their Grank Trunk Pacific venture,
totalling, as I remember, something over
$70,000,000, there was not the slightest equity
in the shares, which the arbitration held to
be valueless. In the usual course of events,
that is, bankruptcy, the Grank Trunk shareholders would never have received anything
for these shares. Yet what do we find?
Twenty years later the holders of the preference shares, which at the time of the
arbitration had a nominal value on the British
market, contend that their shares were confiscated by Act of Parliament. That feelingand there is some ground for it in the fact
just stated-will not down. Agitation still
continues. I am sure the affair has been very
injurious to Canada's credit in Great Britain,
where it is referred to very often by investors.
I quote this instance simply to show good
ground for my fear of similar reaction in
Great Britain on any compulsory co-operation
plan that Parliament may see fit to put into

SENATE
effect by legislation compelling the Canadian
Pacifie to make changes in its system which
its board of directors do not approve as
being in the interest of the company. We
should go very slow indeed in forcing co-operation unless we are prepared to provoke
criticism in Great Britain much louder and
more serious than even the complaint of
the Grand Trunk shareholders, which would
be as the bleat of a sheep compared to the
roar of a lion.
To accept complacently the deficits of our
National Railways, as in fact we have been
doing for nearly ten years, is simply inviting
bankruptcy for the Dominion.
I will not duplicate the figures, which I am
sure other speakers will give you in detail,
more than to say that I should like to point
out the fact that, including capital invested,
Government guarantees, interest paid and
deficits, the total cost to the Dominion of its
railway venture is said to exceed $3,300,000,000.
This is $200,000,000 greater than the national
debt of Canada, which stands at $3,100,000,000.
What a happy position we should be in to-day
if the country had kept out of this unfortunate business from the start-provided, of
course, that we had saved the money and not
thrown it away on some equally improvident
venture.
In the face of annual deficits of over $50,000,000 a year, with little or no hope of
improvement, the situation is rapidly becoming intolerable. It cannot continue if Canada
is to remain solvent. It is amazing that such
a large percentage of our population fail to
approciate the situation or concern themselves
about it.
The cost of government ownership to date
well justifies the fear that disturbs the minds
of many thinking Canadians to-day. They
prefer to try unification, the other avenue
which promises escape from at least a part
of the present railway burden. I share with
them their grave fears and distrust of government ownership as it stands to-day. Our
record in that regard speaks for itself.
However, we must recognize the fact that
the great majority of our citizens would not
now agree to unification. The only consolidation of our railways the public will at this
moment entertain, believe it or not, is government ownership. They fear anything resembling private monopoly, particularly in the
West, where it proved so burdensome about
thirty or thirty-five years ago. It is still
remembered, and doubtless accounts in no
smail part for the hostility ta unification as
proposed. Labour, fearful of the curtailment
of employment which would result, is also a
powerful influence against consolidation.
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

The public have yet to be convinced that
the present situation cannot continue. They
are not impressed by the findings of parliamentary committees, which they believe are
influenced either by party polities or by
the private railway. Nor are they impressed by
speeches of members of either House of Parliament with which the public's preconceived
opinions do not agree; and much less by
the proposaIs or speeches of interested parties.
Some method of obtaining for the public's enlightenment, from an authority removed
from political or railway influence, an opinion on our railway situation in which they
will have confidence, is, I believe, absolutely
necessary if we are to make progress in the
solution of our railway deficits. Hence the
suggestion in my proposal for a board of
three judges whose findings on our entire
railway problem would carry weight with the
country.
I know we have had a number of commissions whose reports are available, and I can
appreciate the dislike many honourable members may have to further reports along this
line. However, the latest inquiry of this
kind is now seven years old. The railway
situation has grown much more binding in
the meantime.
Committees of your honourable House,
during the last five years, have made several inquiries, ending recently with a
two-year effort by your Special Railway Committee. And where have we arrived?
What have we accomplished? The speech of
the leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), I predict, will show clearly, as did
the speech of the leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), that we have accomplished very little in getting results. I am quite
sure that unless the House takes definite action
in the matter we shall end up a year hence
practically where we are to-day, but with the
added deficit for another year. If we permit
the situation to drift along for another ten
years. we may expect to add another half
billion dollars to our national debt in taking
care of our railway deficits, not to mention the
new capital requirements to which I have
already referred.
It is said that a board of judges would not
know anything about railways. The same
thing might be said about any case which
comes, before the courts. Judges do not
personally know every business which comes
before them, yet their judgments are sought,
are generally correct, and almost unanimously
accepted by the public. So why not in this
instance? Not only have I the highest respect
for my honoured leader, but I have also the

MAY 24, 1939
greatest confidence in bis judgment. I consider him one of the ablest men it has ever
been my privilege to know. In this instance,
however, I can only recondile his recommendation for the appointment of a firm of chartered accountants and engineers with the
fact that bis legal mind impels him to get
to the bottom of ail disputes and obtain the
correct answers. The precision with which
he deals with the daily routine of this honourable House is indicative of bis desires with
respect to the subject-matter. We ail know
large savings can be made from consolidation
of our railways. Whether the Canadian
Pacifie or the Canadian National is correct
ini its estimate of savings is flot material.
Midway between these two, estimates mîglit
be a reasonable judgment, and for the point
at issue that should suffioe.
Why emqiloy that unusual firma of chartered
accountants and engineers? I have had muich
experience with both classes. They are difficuit
enough divided. With both in one firm, I
should anticipate the difficulties would be
greatly increased. Picture them in our committee next session defending their report
against the men in one or both railways .who
know the particular branch of the railway
work in dispute. Arguments which we have
listened to for the past two years would be
doubly confounded, and in the end the firm's
report would doubtless be pretty well discredited. I do not know that a competent,
independent-and I emphasize "independent"
-firm of engineers and accountants could be
found. The chances are they wouid be
unacceptalble to one of the railways at least,
and I fear that a year or two hence the public
would still cry party politîcs versus Canadian
Pacifie, or vice versa. After ail, that substantial
savings ini operating costs would be effected
under any plan of consolidation is not open to
serious question, and, at best, operating costs
are but a part of the problemn of amalgamation.
I was much impressed with the use of the
word " firm " in the motion of my right
honourable leader, with reference to an unusual
partnership. I regret that owinig to my lack
of knowledge of parliamentary technique I
called my three judges a "board," which,
1 am told, means another royal commission.
It seems to me the work of my board od
judges would include the work of the firm,
and would also include a report to the Government on our entire railway problem. Perhaps
it is the high standing of nfy proposed board
that necessitates the fitting termn "royal commission." If so, that is aIl right with me.
I suhmit, honourable members, that such a
report to the Government, availaible at the
next session, might start us on the way to
deflnite action. Time is certainly an essence

in this matter, and I am anxious that we make
progress towards a solution. And may I
repeat, in support of my proposai for a firm
of judges-excuse me-I mean a board of
judges-that their report would convince the
Canadian people, and there would be no
opportunity for arguments from the opposing
railway camps. Furthermore, it seems to me
that the advocates of unification, if they have
as much confidence in their cause as their
advocacy implies, should have no hesitation
in joining me in my recommendation for the
highest court the Government can appoint to
review this entire matter.
I could not see in the motion of my right
honoursble leader anything but a rehearsal
of the evidence which bas been placed before
us for the last two sessions, with the probability of our 'being as far away from the goal
this time next year as we are to-day. For
that reason I voted against it.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) also disappointed me. For
him I have the highest esteem,--yes, even
more. I think I can count myself in wit-h
many members of the House when I say
that my feelings are much more tender than
the word "esteem" implies. We on this side
of the House recognize his untiring energy.
Every day, and many times a day, we get a
thrill out of the cleverness he dispîsys in
protecting himself in the debates, which come,
of course, more frequently from this side of
the Huse. His cleverness in this respect is
the result of bis long and active career in
public life. His kindness under ahl circumstances calîs forth from everyone the hope
he may continue with us for many years to
come.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Just the same, I was
disappointed when 'he did not adopt my proposal. He is always a man of action; go 1
thought it would appeal to him.
It would appear, go far as the committee is
concerned, there is only one member who
thinks along the same lines as I do: the
honouraýble senator fromn Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). At least we are both for action. We
desire to get somewhere with this railway business. For that reason we voted against our
leaders.
I can best state my opinion of the report
of the committee now before you in the twoword military command, "carry on"ý-or
perhaps "stand at ease" would be just as
suitable. The sublime patience of the honourable leader of the House wiîth voluntary cooperation, after six years of such negative
results, would, I am sure, entitle him to challenge the reputation of Job, if that patient

SENATE
man were to return to ibis troubled world.
The divine faithi which the honourable
leader of the House bas in the future of our
National Railways is wonderful indeed, wben
we stop to consider last year's balance sheet
and the evidence in the files of your cernmittee. The tenderness wjth whicb hie just

ways, knowing that their work would be for
the general good of their fellow-citizens. If
this is beyond the ability of our democratie
goverrnent to arrange, then-God help Canada!-the day of the dictator is in sight.
I cannot close my remarks at this point.
May I suggest to this honourable House what
I think should be done if we are to survive
the present high tide of public expenditures
by the various governments in Canada,
federal, provincial and municipal-expenditures
which in the aggregate are adding at a tremendous rate-to the public debt of our Dominion, now estimated at over eight billion dollars.
I sometimes think the agitation with regard
to our railway deficits is overshadowing and
obscuring the larger public expenditures, which
apparently are leading only to further despair.
Governients in Canada are spending in the
aggregate probably $150,000,000 a year on
account of unemployment and relief, and there
is practically nothing to show for this expenditure beyond a very marked deterioration in the
moral status of our citizens. It bas been
stated that 200,000 young Canadians pass the
age of 16 every year. It is reliably estimated
that some 350,000 young Canadians between
the ages of 18 and 30. most of whom have come
to working age since the depression began in
1930, are to-day rotting on the doorstep of unemployment. What is more valuable to a country than the high standard of its citizenship? Even war cannot be more important,
and, as honourable senators know, we should
probably spend the greater part of a billion
dollars in our first year at war. Many other
issues of first magnitude confront us. Honourable members know them too well to
require me to enumerate them.
We have appointed a number of boards
during the last few years, but the most
important of all is seldom if ever discussed.
I refer to a National Planning Board. We
continue the same old method of appropriating
public moneys which was adopted at the time
of Confederation. It is as out-of-date as the
British North America Act itself. We appropriate for the immediate needs of the country
without any fixed objective in view. We
dawdle along, content with a hand-to-mouth
policy, and withouit any fixed plan for 'the
future. The citizen who lives only for the day
is of little use to his country. The business
man who does not look ahead, if you can call
him a business man, soon comes to grief.
We have before us a very striking instance
of the need of future planning in the estimates for this year. First, we have had the
main estimates, secondly the supplementary
estimates, and then the special supplementary
estimates-three attempts which still do not
include the millions since voted by Parliament.

441

A survey of the supplementary estimates shows
that they, like the "gentle rain fron Heaven,"
fall all over the country. They are mostly
for public buildings, post offices, dredging,
vharves, docks, and even drainage schemes.
They bear the earmarks of the members of
Parliament who, recognizing the demands of
their electors, feel they must "bring home the
bacon."
Canada should establish a Department of
Works on the principle of the British Department of Works, which expends the sum voted
by Parliament where it is most required,
keeping the national interest in view. British
members of Parliament have practically nothing to say about this expenditure. Such a
department would not only get efficiency in
our expenditure, but would relieve members
of Parliament from much of the pressure from
home to which they are now subjected, and
would leave them more time to devote to the
major issues before the country.
The Federal District Commission at Ottawa
presents an ocular demonstration of planning
ahead. From year to year, as the plan proceeds and the scheme unfolds, we all realize
the advantage of this well-thought-out and
consistent development which in the end wili
make our Capital City the beautiful city it
should be.
This planning for the future is one leaf we
might take out of the dictator's book. Russia
started with a five-year plan; Germany next
adopted a similar plan; Italy has been following along the same lines. These three nations
have been making progress.
There is much need for a National Planning
Board in Canada. Our system of government
as it exists to-day leaveg no time for the
working out of a forward-looking policy, and
provides no means of gaining public support
of a programme hastily arrived at. A
National Planning Board would be composed
of a number of citizens, drawn from different
parts of the country, who for patriotic reasons
would be glad of the opportunity afforded
them to give much of their time to national
planning. They would take all national
problems into their deliberations, in a
programme covering at least five years. They
would consider the avenues through which
the capital required could be secured, and the
question of taxation to raise the money.
Their annual report and recommendation to
the Government and Parliament should be
invaluable. With a maximum tenure of office
of ten years, and a replacement of one or two
members each year, the work of this board
would be continuous and would extend over
the life of many parliaments-a very important
consideration for continuous work. If it is
the opinion of honourable senators that in

442

SENATE

the present serious situation there are flot
enough competent patriotie citizens who are
willing to devote their services te their
country, in order to forma such a board, and
that it is impractical to expect their recommendations to ho ever adopted by the Government of the day, then again I say, look out
for the dictator!
Our railways would certainly forma a part
of national planning. In this connection I can
visuialize, eventually, one modernly equipped
transcontinental line from sea to sea, with
our other existing railways re-arrangod, se, far
as practicable. as feeders to this main artory.
These branches, too, would be gradually
altered to conforma with modern railway
developments. It will readily be seen that in
such a plan unification or private ownership
can find no place. The present competitive
transportation serviesq could lbe co-ordinated
with our National Railways, or ho largely
taken over by them. New roads also could lie
constructcd wvith a view of serving our railways. In short, aIl our methods of transportation hloffld ho co-erdinated in the best interest of the Dominion.
This program, coupled with a national plan
of road-building, would not only retain the
tourist business we now enjoy, estimated at
$300,000,000 a year, but would, I believe,
easily double it, perhaps treble it.
Tbe
130,000,000 too much sun-kissed Americans
located south of our 3,500-mile boundary lino
promise a certain annual cr-op in the formi of
tourists, which will not ho affected by the
usual disappointments attributed to Providence. If we will but capitalize our opportunities this American tourist business can
ho built up to heoene of our great-est sources
of national income.
Sorne long-range plan such as I have suggested, with the employment it would croate,
and includling the direct and collateral work
whichi it would stimulate, shiould not enly
result in reliex ing tie minds of our mailway
employcos of tho fear of consolidation, but
should provide a means wlieroby we migit
hope to end unempîonment to a large extent
and romnove the necessity for a continuation
of the prosent dole. It would afford employment to the young mon who are to-day praying for a chance to work. As to financing
tie effort, that problem must be solved. If
we can provide a billion dollars for a war
of destruction, we can surely finance in the
saine measure a well-con.sidered program
of reconstruction and national development.
Honourable senators, we are living in a
new world. Except as to the basic principle-and even these wc may have to modify to

clone in the past is of very little value as a
guide to us in the presont situation. The
world will nover roturn to the basis which
prevailed before the Great War. With our
collective years of experienco and, may I say,
wisdem, our duty, as I see it, is to help guide
the ship of Stato safely tirougli the troublesome seas whîch lie ahead.
I have been one of those who believed in
the two-party systomn of governmont. To-day
we have rising in our midst a third party, a
fourth party and several others. United, they
would seriously challenge the stability of gevernment in this Dominion. Their seeds of
dissatisfactien, genuino but unsound. as they
arc, faîl on very fertile ground at this time.
If ticir sewing were to meet with succoss,
we could expeet to reap only a harvest of
tares.
After fourteen years in Parliament I am
forced to agreo with the general opinion of
the younger citizens of our country, that there
is ne fundamental difforence, ne difference
of principle. bctween the two old parties,
that is. between Liberals and Conservatives.
«'In union is strengti." The need for a
strong government ivas nover so urgent in
Canada as it is to-day. Our national situation
calîs for tie united support of aIl Canadians
wio have a stake in Canada, aIl Canadians
who have tie best interests of their country at
ieart.
Our situation in Canada is flot as dark as it
may look in the picture I have painted. The
country in which wo live, with its great undcx elopcd natural rosources and sparse population, is tie best country in the world. To-day
Canada is attrac.ting the attention of thousands of Europeans wio are looking for a
safe place for their capital and a safer place
to livo; a country where political and religious
liberties prevail.
Mass migration fromn the
Old World is under way. So far it is largely
ernigration of capital, but industry and industrialists are beginning to follow their capital.
They flot enly wisi to keep an oe on their
capital, but in a larger way tiey are soeking
to build up their Old World industries in the
New World, hoping to rocapture the export
markets formerly served from their factories
in Europe.
South America, with its defaults and property seizures, bas severely shaken European
confidence and it is not. our competiter.
Canada alone stands eut as a country which
offers the groatost of epportunities with the
assurance of freedom. The movemont te Canada ef industrialists, tecinicians and scientists,
the best brains of Europe, is regarded !by farseoing mon as of the iighest importance. It
is estimated that in excess of one hundred mil-

MAY 24, 1939
lion dollars in cash and securities have corne
to Canada from European countries in the last
year. Thirteen million dollars in refuges gold
arrived at Halifax last week ini two shipmente,
one from Holland and the other f rom Belgium.
Our Bank of Canada, I believe, is acting as
storage agent for large amounts of refugee
gold, which, of course, is flot included in the
hank's gold reserves. Some of this "hot"
money would be withdrawn from Canada if
the international situation improved. However, it is believed that rnost of the money
will be permanently invested in Canadian
bonds, mortgages, gold stocks and blue chip
stocks, with gold stocks and blue chips attracting the larger part of investment funds. There
is reason to believe that some of the owners
of this capital are awaiting lower security
prices before purchasing. A break in the
market would afford thern the opportunity
to buy. The movement is only getting well
under way. With proper encouragement and
no improvernent in the European situation, it
should reach vast proportions in the next
year or two. Stability in Canada is the best
forrn of encouragement that we can offer.

great though they may be, are but a feeble

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I believe we should lose
no tirne in laying plans to encourage and
profit hy the flight of capital and brains from
the Old World. Hence the immediate need
for a strong government and long-range planning if we are to capitalize the situation which
is now be-fore us. Are we Canàdians big
enough and able enough to take advantage of
this opportunity to save and to make Canada?
In furtherance of rny plea for united action
by this honourable House, I close my remarks
with the immortal words of General Grant:
"Let us have peace."
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I arn very glad to have the opportunity of
following the 'honourable gentleman f-rom
Vancouver (Hon. *Mr. Mdflae), because it
seems to me we are the only two who dissent
frorn our colleagues on the Special Railway
Committee. But my rernarks will be brief,
for I do not intend to repeat what has already
been said. The report presented hy the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.

44à~

Mr. Dandurand) contains a complete and fair
digest of evidence given before the committee, so far as it could be stated in such a
narrow space, and 1 would say the same
t.hing of the report which. bas been rnoved in
arnendrnent by the honourable gentleman
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). But
I feel that since the cornrittee sat during
two sessions, and the honourable senator frorn
Vancouver and I are the only two members
whose views seern to run along the same lines
-although our views do not run parallel
the whole way-I should not be fair to
myseif if I did flot give a short explanation
of the position I have taken and intend to
take.
I amrn ot able to agree with the report
recommended by the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), because
it doas flot contain what I think a report of
thîs kind should contain: a clear-cut, concrete
and unequivocal recommendation to the
Senate. I cannot see any real value in a
report whieh omits such a recommendation.
That omission is what I find fault with. I arn
quite in favour of the report in its general
principles, that is, in its opposition to unification and its advocacy of co-operation; but,
because it lacks the recommendation I havé
referred to, I arn unable to support it and,
if I arn present, I shail vote against it.
Neither arn I able to agree with the report
brought in as an amendmenit by the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien). It is f rankly in favour of unification. I need flot go into that report,
because it bas been deait with pretty fully
already, and undoubtedly more will be said
in support of it by other honourable mcmbers.
I feel that both railways are guilty of
dereliction in a duty whichi lies very clearly
before them. In 1933 we passed an Act
providing machinery for setting up an arbitral
board to effect cornpulsory or semi-compulsory
arbitration. Evidence given before the comiuittee seemed to, show that the Canadian
Pacific took every opportunity of evading 'an
appeal to, this board. 1 do not know whether
àt can be said that company was the only
offender in this respect. I do not think it
was, for in my opinion the Canadian National
was equally negligent in not having invoked
the machinery of the law, as it was so clearly
within its power to do, and brought the
Canadian Pacifie before this board. They
should have invoked that lawHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said so.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: -and had compulsory
arbitration put into effect. In failing to do

MAY 24, 1939
in order to keep the two railway systems
separate we must have separate management.
It is inconsistent to say that we will keep the
two properties separate and at the same
time to propose unified management. It is
suggested that unified operation should be
under the control of a board of fifteen
directors, five to be selected by the Government or by the Canadian National, five by
the Canadian Pacific, and the remaining five
by the directors already chosen, or by some
other appropriate method. Therein I see the
difficulty of keeping the properties separate.
When Sir Edward Beatty appeared before
the committee he was asked, "If under unification considerable economies were effected,
would it not result in the two properties being
gradually merged?" "Well," he said, "within
a space of ten years the properties would be
so merged that it would be practica'lly impossible to unscramble them, but to unscramble
them would absorb all the savings that had
been made during the ten years of unification."
I want to direct the attention of honourable
senators to what the honourable member from
Mantarville has termed the alternative report.
What I wish to refer to will be found in the
proceedings of our committee at page 468.
Before I deal with this report, in which, no
doubt, the right honourable leader opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) had the largest
share, although other members endorsed itHon. Mr. HAIG: I question that.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: You do?

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: But I must say that
on this occasion I do not find myself in
agreement with the report which he presented
to our Railway Committee as the leader of
the party opposite.
Now I ask honourable members to turn
to page 468. I intend to quote a passage near
the bottom of the page to show the dangers
of unification, felt apparently by the honourable gentlemen who signed this report. Near
the middle of paragraph 4 I find the following:
To ensure the full conservation of every essential public interest and publie service, and to
safeguard the interests of Canada, the undersigned recommend insistence on the conditions
enumerated below in respect of any system of
unified management whieh may be worked out.
They would not have any without these
conditions.
The undermentioned stipulations are not
advanced with any thought that they are allinclusive.
They are willing to give more-as many as
you like.
We believe, however, that conditions in Canada, both as affecting the Dominion on the one
hand, and as affecting the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company on the other, are such that
all necessary and reasonable provisions can be
arrived at and agreed upon. The following
objectives should be secured:
i. There should be no obligation, legal or
moral, implied or expressed, whereby the
country assumes any liability in respect of
Canadian Pacifie obligations or securities, either
as to capital or interest.
It will be observed that of these eight
stipulations there is not one which says, "We
are going to protect the Canadian Pacifie
Railway." Every protection is promised to
the Canadian National Railways if they will
only come under unification.
Let us take the next objective:
ii. Any plan of unified management adopted
should be such that the resulting operation cau
in no sense be dominated by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company.

I turn to the eight dangers which the
signatories of this report have set out with
regard to unification or amalgamation. They
know the public appreciate the dangers inherent in unification, and they say, "We will
give you all the stipulations tbat you want."
But what does a contract like that mean to a
business man? It means the Canadian National Railways would be holding a bag of
stipulations, and the Canadian Pacifie Railway would be holding the control, management and operation of the amalgamated
railways. That is all I can see in these
clauses. Why should there be all these safeguards for the Canadian National Railways
and none for the Canadian Pacifie?

New capital investments, limited as they will

Dominion of Canada), on the one hand, and of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company on the
other hand.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That applies
equally to both; it equally protects both.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Yes, it does, if they
can wnrk it out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You are
saying there is nothing here for the Canadian

Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The Government can

Hon. Mr. HORSEY: It might not be able
to get it at ahl, though I think it could. Ail
I want to point out is that these thoughts as
to the dangers of unification or amalgamation
were running through the minds of the members of the eommittee, and are expressed in
the report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHES: Perhsîps the
lhonourable gentleman would tell us what he
thinks should be inserted on behaif of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: One thing that I think
might be put in is a provision that in the
expenditure of huge sums of money the Canadian National should be controlled in its use
of the public purse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is of
the essence of unified management.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: I dIo not tliink it is.
llowevcr, 1 just wanted to make that one
point. It seemed to me peculiar that, ail these
objections to and dangers of unification should
be brougbt forward.
Those who stand for unification of management say, "Oh, but wc tried separate management and separate entities under co-operation,
and after five or six years co-operation has
dismnally failed." I listened patiently while the
ex idence was being given by tise officiais of

should favour it if I were convinced that it
would be necessary. It is only natural, perhaps,
for Canadian Pacifie officials to believe that
unification of the railways would result in
very extensive savings. It is my firm opinion
that in time the difficulties I have mentioned
will be overcome, that eventually the railway
problem will be solved, that our taxpayers will
be relieved of much if not all of their present
burden on account of railway deficits, and that

investors in Canadian Pacifie Railway secur-

ities will come into their own, as they deserve
to do.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, no matter what recommendation may
be adopted by this House, I think we are
all agreed that the special committee appointed
to inquire into railway conditions has rendered
a very useful service. I feel that the country
at large, as a result of the work of that
committee, is more familiar with the railway
situation than would otherwise have been
the case. After I listened to the evidence in
the early stages of the sittings of our committee a year ago I felt that no serious, determined attempt had been made to carry out
what had been recommended by the Duff Commission-co-operation between the two great
transportation systems.
In that connection I would say that I do not
believe the country will accept the policy of
unification until it is satisfied that a serious
attempt has been made to solve the railway
problem through co-operation. If the people
are satisfied that it is impossible to effect
substantial economies through co-operation,
they may be more inclined towards taking a
step in the nature of unification or amalgamation.
I am strongly influenced by the findings of
the Dufi Commission. That commission was
composed of representative men from this
country, fron the United States and from
Great Britain. It was an impartial tribunal,
not influenced by Canadian political considerations. It listened to evidence from representatives of both railway systems, and it
travelled througout Canada, saw the railroads
in operation, and appreciated what they meant
to the life of this country. Estimates of
economies under co-operation and under unification were presented by the presidents of
the two railway systems. Sir Edward Beatty
assured the commission of much greater
savings by amalgamation than were estimated in evidence before our special conmittee. In the case of the Canadian Pacifie, it
held the figure it submitted to the Duff Commission; in the case of the Canadian National
the possibility of economies was greatly reduced.

449

The Canadian Pacific submitted to the
Duff Commission estimated savings of from
$40,000,000 to $75,000,000 under amalgamation. But the commission did not recommend
amalgamation. Why did the Duff Commission
not accept those figures and say that great
economies would be possible only under
amalgamation? I am satisfied that, having
seen the railway situation of Canada as a
whole, they realized that amalgamation was
not the proper solution.
On the other hand, they did recommend
that there should be an attempt at co-operation in order to bring about economies, and
they suggested the methods. As a result we
had the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act of 1933, which provided that co-operation
should be carried on in a certain way.
I must confess that co-operation was not
carried on in accordance with that legislation,
for at no time was an arbitral tribunal
invoked. I do not think the country will be
satisfied until the provisions of that Act are
fully tested in relation to co-operation. If it
be a fact that under co-operation it is impossible to effect substantial economies by
utilizing that legislation and by resorting to
an arbitral tribunal in case of disagreement,
then there may be a tendency on the part of
the public to consider some other solution,
probably that suggested by the right honourable leader on the other side of the House.
If it is possible to effect economies to the
extent of $75,000,000 through unification, why
is it not possible to effect a major portion of
those economies under co-operation by using
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act?
There were possibilities of economies under
co-operation that in my opinion should have
been realized quite easily. For instance, each
railway systern has an express company and
a telegraph company. If there were a determined desire for economy, there ought not
to be very much difficulty in bringing into
existence one telegraph and one express company for the service of both railway systems.
But no serious effort has been made in that
direction. The proposal was studied, but that
was the end of it.
Now, I should like to submit a couple of
questions which, it seems to me, those who
advocate unification or amalgamation should

be able to answer during the course of this
debate, for I think the public want to know
whether a solution of our railway problem is

to be found in unification. The country knows
there is a heavy bonded indebtedness of the
Canadian National Railways. Would unification relieve the taxpayer in respect of that
bonded indebtedness?

any possible way?

Would it help in

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

How could it?

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Would the burden
on the taxpayer be just as it is at present,
whether or not there was unification? That
is a question which the taxpayer would like
to have answered. I desire also to submit this
question: If through unification existing lines
were put out of business and services reduced,
would it not intensify competition fromn trucks
and similar sources? I am inclined to think
that it would, and that the trucks would be
much more aggressive.
As to monopoly, I am going to make a confession. I live in a part of the country served
wholly by one railroad. It has always been
so served. If mine were the experience that
Canada might have from the operation of one
railroad system, I would say there is nothing
very much to fear from monopoly. But then
again I know I could not get a very warm
reception for that point of view throughout
the whole of Western Canada, because the
people there still remember the time when
they felt they were under a crushing railway
monopoly. Therefore they have neither sympathy nor desire for one railroad service.
They have long memories, and it may take
some time to convince them that a railway
monopoly would not harm them. At any rate,
in any discussion on unification the question
of monopoly is bound to be brought forward as
a major point for consideration.
I do not wish to discuss the evidence or
the figures submitted to our committee, for it
would be merely rehashing a good deal of what
has already been submitted to the House. I
wish to say frankly that I believe every member of the committee was keenly interested in
the railway problem and eager to find some
way of helping to bring about a solution. We
may differ in our respective viewpoints, but
I feel very strongly that we should not go
further at present than to make a thorough
test of co-operation, and make it far more
earnestly than it has been made up to the
present time. Then, should it be demonstrated that co-operation cannot work, I am
satisfied the people would treat more seriously
the solution suggested by the members of the
committee from the other side of the House,
that is, unification.

GRAIN BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 62, an Act to amend The Canada Grain
Act.
The motion was agreed to.
MOTION

FOR THIRD READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Now.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, before this Bill is read a third time, I
wish to move that section 46 be deleted from
the Bill. This is the section which authorizes
mixing.
I made my objections in the committee, but,
as only a snall number of members were
present, I should like to say a few words
here. This clause is not in the interest of the
producer. I learned at lunch-time that it was
bitterly opposed by four Government members in the committee of the House of Commons; and I am told by the former Minister
of Agriculture that it upsets all the good
work he was trying to do. He says there is
another clause under which almost anything
under Heaven can be accomplished.
What is proposed here is, I think, a step
in the wrong direction. I therefore move,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aseltine, that section
46 be deleted from the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps the
honourable gentleman would proceed otherwise.
He might move that the Bill be not now
read a third time, but that it be amended in
a certain way.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: All right. I move
that the Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be amended by striking out clause
46.

MAY 25, 1939
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, lest there may be some misconception on the part of those who were
not in attendance at committee this morning
when this Bill was discussed, I should like to
make a very brief explanation.
This clause of the Bill does not permit
mixing in the ordinary sense of the word: it
does not permit the mixing of different grades
of grain. What it does permit is the
mixing of grain that may be slightly tough
with grain of the same grade that is dry, in
order that the tough grain may be brought up
to standard by reason of some of the moisture
in it being absorbed by the dry grain. As
was explained before the committee, this kind
of mixing hes been done under the regulations
of the Grain Board, and that board wanted
to have further authority for it in the Act.
This mixing of grain at the elevators in order
to bring it up to standard has resulted in a
very substantial lessening of the difference
between the prices of, say, No. 1 tough and
No. 1 standard. The man who had the misfortune to experience a snow-storm or a little
rain when he was threshing had to suifer a
reduction in price. He could not stop
operations when the machinery and the workers were there. As was explained *by Mr.
Ross, who appeared before the committee,
there used to be a margin of 8 or sometimes 10
cents a bushel. If it were proposed to permit
the mixing of different grades of grain, I think
every member of this House or the House
of Commons would be opposed to it; but
that is not what is contemplated at all. If a
farmer has No. 1 grade and, it is tough, lie
either has to pay from 4 to 5 cents a bushel to
have it put through the drier or has to send it
to the terminal elevator direct and take a less
favourable price for it. This provision is to
enable him to get a better price.
This Bill has been opposed in the Commons
by two, three or four members on the general
ground that no mixing of any kind should be
allowed. But, as I have said, this kind of
mixing has been done under regulation, and
has proved beneficial to the farmer. It is
not of any advantage to the elevator at all.
The Grain Board is unanimous in recommending that this provision be enacted. It will
not affect the marketing of Canadian wheat in
the British or foreign markets to whilch the
wheat is to go.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I am in favour of the amendment proposed by the honourable senator from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner). Mr.
Ross, member of the House of Commons for
Moose Jaw, said that the amendment con-.
tained in this Bill would benefit the farmers
71498-29J

451

of Northern Saskatchewan, where there is
more damp grain than elsewhere. I may be
pardoned for going into a little detail so that
honourable gentlemen who were not present
at the meeting of the committee may have
some idea of what is involved. For many
years the terminal elevator companies in
Western Canada bought various grades of
wheat, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and so on. The
average difference in price between grades
is about 2 cents a bushel. In 1927, 1928 or
'29, after a long and bitter struggle, the mixing of grades was prohibited. The farmers
maintained that the only people who benefited
from the mixing of grades were the elevator
owners; that the farmers themselves got no
benefit from it, and after the grain reached
the British or European market they failed to
receive the bonus they were entitled to for
No. 1 Hard or No. 1 Northern.
Then the question of damp grain arose.
Damp grain is grain which contains, I think,
more than 13 per cent moisture.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

14.4 per cent.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: 14.4 per cent. If it
contains between 14.4 and 17 per cent it is
damp grain, and if more than 17 per cent it
goes into another category. You can mix a
certain percentage of damp grain with very
dry grain. The grain of southern Manitoba,
southern Saskatchewan and southern Alberta
carries only 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 per cent of moisture.
As I say, the farmers maintain they do
not get the benefit of the mixing. In committee this morning Mr. Ross maintained that
they did, because the difference in price, which
used to be eight or ten cents a bushel, is now
only one and a half cents. Of course, if
we had a very wet year, as we had in 1912,
there would be so much damp grain that it
would not matter what mixing was done.
In almost every elevator in Western Canada
there is a machine for testing the moisture
content of grain. If Mr. Horner, or Mr.
Sharpe, or anyone else brings in grain that
the machine shows is going damp, he will be
told of that and advised to stop threshing
until dry weather comes along again. He
either follows that advice or leaves the grain
at home in his own granary and mixes it with
his own dry grain, in which case all his grain
will be dry and lie will get the benefit.
I am not opposed to the mixing of damp
grain with dry grain, but if this new section
is passed there will be an extension of the
practice and next year permission may be
sought to mix No. 1 with No. 3 and No. 4.
There is no demand by the farmers in Western Canada for this legislation.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: My honourable
friend should, know that this section does
not permit the kind of mixing he is talking
about.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know all about it.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: He is building up
a straw man to knock him down.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I know what kind
of mixing this section permits, and I am
warning that if we go so far as this to-day
there will be no end to the thing. I repeat
that the farmers in Western Canada do not
want the legislation.
As a senator from
Manitoba I must protest strongly against
interfering with the regular grading of our
grain for the European markets. There is
no doubt that on those markets our grain
commands a premium.
We ought te do
averything in our power to maintain its high
reputation. I asked in committee this morning, and I repeat the question here, whether
anyone can say that organized farmers of
Western Canada want this new provision in
the Act. The farmers of Manitoba know
who I am and where I can be reached. They
send representations to me about every matter
which they wish me to support on their
behalf. but not a single representation has
come from them in favour of this section. I
therefore urge adoption of the amendment
moved by the honourable senator from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members. I suggest that, if the honourable
senator from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) is
agreeable, this debate be adjourned until tomorrow. Though I was present during a good
part of the committee discussion this morning, I had to miss some of it, and my opinion
upon the feature now under consideration is
not formulated. I am desirous of giving an
intelligent vote upon it, because unquestionably the matter is considered of great importance in the West. In the minds of farmers
it is of more importance, perhaps, than its
possible consequences warrant.
Another reason for letting the matter stand
until to-morrow is that we are ready to
continue our discussion of the railway problem and are eager to have that discussion
disposed of.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Certainly, I am
agreeable to the right honourable gentleman's
suggestion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who is moving
adjournment of the debate?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
will move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I concur, but
I should net like my honourable colleagues
to take it that what tas been said by my
honourable friends from Saskatchewan North
and Winnipeg
South-Centre
(Hon. Mr.
Horner and Hon. Mr. Haig) is correct. I
think their statements are entirely wrong.
However, we shall discuss that to-morrow.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate
was adjourned.

ÇANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEM
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTE-DEBATE CON.TINUED

The Senate. resumed from yesterday consideration of the report of the Special Committee appointed on March 30, 1938, ýta
inquire into and report upon the .best means
of relieving the country of it's extremeIy
serious railway condition and finanoial burden
consequent thereto.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I feel that 1 arn in. a somewhat embarrassing
position in addressing myseif to tJhe railway
question at the present tiýme. WThen the
inquiry into this sufbjeet started I had great
hopes that it would restait in some definite
benefit to this House, and, stili more important,
ta 'the country at large. During the first year
of our inquiry the cammittee had very excellent sessions and secured a great deal of
information which not only was of value to
every member of the Senate, but, I arn sure,
was also appreciated by the people at large
throughout the country. When we reassembled
this year a different spirit secmed to pervade
the committee, and in my opinion no progress
was made, and littie was donc that wus of
benefit either to ourselves or to the country
at large.
1 have listened with interest to the speeches
made in LVhis Flouise respecting the two reports
su'britted. While the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) gave,, in
a most admirable manner, a clear and concise
résumé of the evidence, I was unabie te find
ir. the report hie presented any suggestion
which offered hope of a solution of the problem before us.
The speech of the honoura:ble gentleman
was, as his speeches usually are, most eloquent,
and it did contain.one suggestion, em.bodïed
in «tha words "true ca-oparation." So far
as I have been able ta interpret 'his remarks,
that was the only constructive, helpful suggestion placcd before us. The leader of the
Flouse mentioned a saving of $52,875,000 that
might possibly be obtained. cither through
unified management or through co-operation.
H1e intimated that it was speculative, though
that may not have been the word hie used.
After listaning ta the evidence and observing
the results produced by co-operation during
the pyastsix years, 1 must say that 1 arn unable
to share the optimismn expresscd by the hionourable gentleman with regard to the railways.
The Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act was passed waut six ye'ars ago, after
considerable discussion in this Flouse. We pu.t
in clause 33, which was supposed to give
same real strength ta the Act, and which set
up niacbinery whereby the two aompaniez,

453

in casge they were unable ta agree on measures
of co-operation, could go ta a tribunal ta
get a decision. During the first three years
there was apparently no effort made by either
railroad ta exercise any of the economies which
had been so strongly recommended, at leaut
by uhis Flouse. Now, six years after the
inception of the Act, the total savings amount
ta about $1,900,000. This restaît impels me ta
ask: Il by the co-operative method it takes
six years ta rcach a total of less than, $2,000r000, how long will it take ta effect a saving
of $52,875,000? 1 mention this point because,
ta my mind, it does not indicate that caoperation is -the solution of ou-r railway
preblem.
I listened with a great deal of interest ta
the remarks of the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae). I congratulaVe him on his excellent address. IV was
full of information of great value. But, again
I ask, what was there in it ta indicate ta this
flouse the means we should take ta overcome
the difficulties confronting us with respect ta
aur railways? That address all cames down
ta anc Vhing, and anc thing only-another
,commission; caîl it a royal commission or
what you will. We have had commission after
commission. and cammittea alfter committce,
but the situation remains the samne so far as
the*loss is concarnad, and because the loss of
cach year is added ta the lasses of the preccding years aur position becomes worse and
worsa as time goas on.
The next honourable senatar who spoke
was the honourable gentleman fram Prince
Edward (Hon. Mr. Horsey). 1 arn free ta
admit that I was unable ta follaw his argument as ta the safeguards contained in the
report prescntcd by my honaurable friand
(Hon. Mr. Beauhien) on this sida. In my
vicw those safeguards are vital, and if they
had noV bean ambodied in the report I would
not have signced it. Evan with those saleguards in the report, I signcd it with a. mental
rasarvation. Sa far as I could sec, it offered
the only reasonaýble solution and the only
prospect of attaining a saviag. I think that
in calling attention ta thosa safeguards the
honourable gentleman did us a service.
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
llorsey) made a staternent which 1 thought
was mast ra-markable. It revealed hirn in a
position upon which 1 cangratulate him. He
said, "I have no financial interest in cither
road." If that is so. hie is one of the most
fortunate men in Canada.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE. H1e is a shareholder
of the -Canadian National.
Han. Mr. BLACK: If hie is able ta escape
taxation, hae is about the anly man in Canada
vho can. Every year I bave ta pay an incarne

454

SENATE

tax, and every time I pay it I am reminded
that so many hundreds or thousands of dollars of this tax go directly to the payment
of losses on our railways. Over a period of
years I have put a considerable amount of
money into our railways, and every other
honourable gentleman bore has done likewise.
Therefore I say that everyone in Canada has
a very vital financial interest in this question.
I think the honourable gentleman was mistaken when he said ho had no financial
interest. As to his having no interest in the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, I take his word.
Neither have I.
While on this subject, may I make clear
my position with regard to my interest in
railways?
I live in Westmorland County,
which has always been served by Government
railways-first by the old Intercolonial, and
later by the Canadian National-and never
by any other. I and my people before me
have been engaged in shipbuilding and in the
shipping business. Our ports have been Sackville. which was a seaport up to the time
when the rails were taken up; Moncton;
Shedian. which is still a shipping port; and
Saint John. It was only by the use of the
Canadian National Railwavs that we coild
reach those ports. MY sympathies liave always
been and are to-day with the Canadian
National. However, J am bouod to rivthe
railhay situation in its relationship to the
lipep of Canada.
Now I come te another remark by the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Horsey)
which surprised me. He said in effect that
one of the resuits of unification of managenient would be absorption of the Canadian
National Railhays by the Canadian Pacific
Railway. All I can say is that I wish the
honourable gentleman were right. I do not
think thlre is a citizen of Canada who would
not be happy indeed if some individual, or
private company. or corporation would take
the Canadian National off our hands. In
making this statement I am not saying anything detrimental to the Canadian National
lines. We all know hoi we came into
possession of them. I am convinced that
we could not ýfind an individual. corporation
or company who would take the Canadian
National as a gift, if along with it went the
necessitv of continuing te operate those railways as they are operated to-day.
Why did we take over the Grand Trunk?
It was because the people who had owned and
operated it previously were unable to continue. It had either to go into the hands of
a receiver or be taken over by the Government. Why d'id we get the Canadian Northern?
For exactly the same reason.
No
private company, individual or corporation
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

could afford to operate the roads. Consequently we now have all these roads on our
hande, and have to make the best of them.
To say that the Canadian Pacifie Railway
would like to take over the Canadian National
is a statement which does not fairly represent
the true position. We could not induce the
Canadian Pacifie to take over the Canadian
National Railway system and operate it. We
all know that, and we might as well admit it.
I listened with a good deal of interest to
the remarks of my honourable friend from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). He agreed with
what had been said by the honouralble senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), and
in certain respects lie felt much as I do. He
was not satisfied with the committee's report
nor with the alternative report.
However,
lie was unable to suggest any way of improving our railway situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) suggested compulsory arbitration.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: He suggested that as
a possible course. I thought that when the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
moved adoption of the committee's report
he would recommend compulsory arbitration,
but lie did net. I can understand, perhaps,
why he did net. When we discussed the railwav situation in 1933 we gave a good deal of
considcration ta the compulsory arbitration
feature. I remember that it was strongly
opposed by the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) and
the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon,
Mr. Calder), but I supported it. I took my
stand on the ground that if compulsory
arbitration were net provided for, the measure
then under consideration would be no good
at all. But it was not provided for, and it
lias not been recommended in the committee's
report.

I was also much interested in the remarks
of my hionourable friend from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan).
Like myself, wihile
feeling that the coimittee lid excellent work.
lie is net satisfied withi the resilts of that
work. At least, tliat is the inference I draw.
He asked, "Would unified management relieve us of the interest on the moneys invested in the Canadian National Railways?"
In my opinion, nothing under heaven will
afford us much re(lief from that burden in
the course of many years to come. It seems
to ibe generally admitted now that the
maximum savings we could exipect fron
conîplete co-operation or unified management
-and the sane results might be obtained by
either of these neans-would be about S25,000,-

any more out of it than an admission that the streight reduction in the indemnities paid ta
railroeds are n.ot eo-operating, because they members of bath bouses, a similar reduction
fear each othe-r and cannot agree upon in salaries paid ta Cabinet Ministers, an
amalgamnation of some portfolios and e reducproposais.
As I have already remax4ced, there does not tien in the number of Cabinet Ministers, s
reduction of 10 per cent in the salaries of
seemn any hope of reducing our railway debt
civil servants, a reduction of from 10 to 20
for a long period of years to came, but it
strikes me that the governments which have per cent in the salaries of Canadien National
been in office from time to time have nlot gone Railway employees receiving $1,500 a yeai
or more. and a reduction in the salaries of ell
as far as they miAght have gone, in endeevourjudges in Canada. I also remarked that if

on this huge debt. Some of the railwey bonds the Canadien National Railways system made
beer interest at 6 per cent, I think; some at 5, a eut in its pay-roll the Canadien Pacifie Railsomé et 4-j end some at 4.. It does seem to me way would undoubtedly follow the leed.
On March 16, 1932, I pointed out that in
that a saving eould *be made if the railway
debts werc consolidated, the bonds called in, 1924 the Canadien National Railweys had
and new ones issued et lower rates. The 99,520 employees, whose salaries emounted ta
immediate effect would be important, but the $140,515.000, and thet by 1930 the company's
annual pay-roll hed increased by more than
ehief benefit would accrue in the future.
Ever since I came to this Huse, and indeed $8,000,000, ta $148,600,000. 1 showed that
from before that time, I have been inter- a 10 per cent eut in ehl salaries of $1,500 a

I also reminded honourehie members et

ways could get rid of the passenger traffic
and look after freight traffic alone, they could
make money. And I went on:
Now, that being the fact-and it was substantiated by an official of the other great
railway system-why is there a proposal to
spend in the city of Montreal a sum not less

than $50,000,000 and not more than $100,000,000

for the purpose of providing greater facilities
to carry on a part of the railway business
which, according to the managers of both roads,
will not pay under any condition?
I should like the House to bear that point
ir mind, because I want to come back to it.
If honourable members will refer to the
Senate Hansard of March 16, 1932, they will
sec that I criticized the practice of giving
froe transportation, or passes, to railway
officials and employees. their families and
friends, and to members of Parliament and
others, and I strongly advocated the abolition
of that practice. I also advocated the complete abolition of franking of telegrams over
all telegraph syst-ems, and the abolition of
franking of expressage. and I gave instances
to illustrate what savings might be effected
thereby. I am quite aware that it is net
a popular thing to urge abolition of passes,
but I want to emphasize once more the
desirability, in my opinion, of having these
suggestions carried out. Railway authorities
told me at the time t-hat many millions of
dollars of extra revenue would be received
if all persons who travelled on passes were
required to pay thoir way. I pointed out,
too, that if sucl action were taken there
would net be nearly as much passenger traffic,
bccause naturallv when a person can travel
on a pass he will take full advantage of it.
I dealt with the arrangement whereby a
railhay man after a certain length of service
is entitled to a pass for bis personal use on
local lines, then after longer service to a
pass for himself and bis family, after a little
longer service to a permanent pass, after still
lonEer service to a pass good all over Canada,
and. finally, after twentv-five years' service,
te a pass for himself and family available
over all the railways of the North American
continent. That is a substantial privilege. I
think long service should be rewarded in
some other way, for undoubtedly the use of
free transportation creates a bad impression
in the publie mind. The man who works
on a faim, in a store, or in an office must
dig down into Lis pocket for railway fare to
nearby towns, but bis brother working for
the railw ay company is able to take the same
trip frec of expense. It is no wonder that
the man who bas to pay bis way regards
free transportation as a privilege enjoyed at
his expense. He resents this emolument given
to a privileged class of labour which, in addiHon. Mr. BLACK.

tion, enjoys a considerably higher scale of
pay. So far as members of Parliament are
concerned, free railway transportation is a
considera'ble convenience to us. In a sense
ours are net strictly 'passes; they are free
transportation to which we are entitled by
statute. However, I think sit would be well
to discontinue the practice and in lieu of
passes grant an additional travel allowance,
graduated according to the distance members
have to travel between their homes and the
Capital.
I again draw this matter to the attention
of my honourable friend the leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) as another
means by which the Government might bring
about economy. Truc, the Government have
to work through the railways, but I am satisfled that the railway management would be
willing to co-operate in order te discontinue
the issue of free passes.
As the evidence adduced before the conmittee las been already discussed, and, no
doubt, will be still further discussed by other
honourable members, I shall not detain the
House with any lengthy reference te it.
I desire now to return to what seems to
me an additional handicap in effecting economies on the railways. I would preface my
remrarks by saying that I intend to reflect net
on the Government of the day alone, but
as well on proceding goverrnments. I think
politics Las played entirely too large a part
in the administration of our railways.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, Lear
Hon. Mr. BLACK: For a time the administration of the Canadian National Railways
was to a large extent free froim party politics.
I hope I an wrong. but to-day I sce what
looks to me like political influence creeping
into the management of the system. It reminds
me of the activity exercised by politicians
in the Maritime Provinces when I had less
experience than I have to-day. At that time
the Intercolonial Railway vas the stamping
ground of ail the local politicians. Patronage
went to Government members who represented the counties through which the railway ran, and its abuse was nothing more
nor less than a scandal.
We do not want to sec that condition
brought back, but I am very much disturbed
by what las happened in the last few months.
Last autumn I was shocked to see in the
press an announcement that the Government,
or the Canadian National Railways, had determined te exipend upwards of $15,000,000 on
the terminal in Montreal. No one knows
how much the urirmate expenditure may be,
but we shall be fortunate if it does not

MAY 25, 1939
Indeed, if the work is
exceed $50,000,000.
carried out in accordance with the plans
submitted in 1931 and 1932, the expenditure
will be far in excess of $50,000,000. At a
time when every effort was apparently being
made by the Government and by Parliament
to bring about substantial economies in the
operation of the Canadian National Railways,
I was very much distressed to realize that
this expenditure was to be made, not for
better accommodation for freight-and that is,
according to the railway officials, the only
traffic which pays-,but to provide facilities
for passenger traffic, which they say will
never pay, and which in fact is declining
year by year. If passenger traffic did not pay
in 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932, how could
it be expected to pay now? In view of these
facts I was forced to the conclusion that the
expenditure implied something more than a
desire to build a terminal station in Montreal.
As I have said, I hope I am wrong, but if I
am I must blame the Montreal newspapers.
At the time of the announcement of the
proposed expenditure a federal 'by-election was
in progress in St. Henri, and also a mayoralty
contest. Apparently these two events made it
necessary that something be done in the city
of Montreal in order to secure support for
certain candidates.
In this connection I would draw attention
to what I regard as a pertinent fact. Last
session when we had Mr. Hungerford and all
bis staff before the special committee there
was not the slightest suggestion that they contemplated any expenditure on the Montreal
terminal.
One of the candidates in the mayoralty
contest was Mr. Camillien Houde. It is evident
from what occurred that the Federal Government desired to see Mr. Houde defeated.
Two federal Ministers and several members
of Parliament supporting the Government
took a most active part in the campaign in
support of his opponent. On January 14 the
Secretary of State, Hon. Mr. Rinfret, pledged
the Government to fill the Dorchester street
hole. Apparently he intended to fil1 it with
the taxpayers' money. In the Montreal Gazette
of January 15, 1938, I find this report:
Blaming none other than independent candidate Camillien Houde for the fact Liberal
Government plans for a C.N.R. Terminal here
were blocked seven years ago, Hon. Fernand
Rinfret promised last night that "the Government of which I am part will settle this C.N.R.
problem. . . , . We will fill the. hole on
Dorchester street, and solve the problem of the
approaches therein." Also to be solved was the
"problem of the level crossinge," in St. Henry.
Mr. Rinfret was speaking at a campaign
meeting for J. A. Bonnier, official Liberal candidate in the St. Henry by-election Monday, in the
basement hall of St. Paul's Church., Ville Emard.

The Secretary of State also pledged the
Federal Government to maintain direct relief
"as long as there are unemployed in Montreal"
-- even if the municipal and provincial governments should become "fatigued" by the burden.
That was a pretty strong statement for a
Minister to make with reference to the policy
of a railway system the administration of
which was supposed to be free from government interference.
Then I find this report in the Montreal
Gazette of January 17, 1938:
Before the general federal elections come,
the Canadian National Railways will have their
central station in Montreal, declared Hon.
P. J. A. Cardin, Minister of Public Works, as
he wound up the Liberal campaign in St. Henry
division last night at the Levis school in Ville
Emard. If the station bas not been builtand Mr. Cardin made it clear that with this
project there was also linked the elimination
of the level crossings-it was because of
Camillien Houde, said the Minister.
At an afternoon meeting in Atwater market
Hon. Fernand Rinfret, Secretary of State, had
made a similar pledge to the 2,000 electors
who attended. Both statements clarified and
amplified the declaration of Mr. Rinfret on
Friday that the Liberal Government would
"fill the hole on Dorchester street." . . .
Mr. Cardin talked for about two hours, and
was never in better form as an orator. Surely,
he said, the people of St. Henry should have
more confidence in Mackenzie King, Ernest
Lapointe, Fernand Rinfret, and himself, than
in Camillien Houde.
It may be stated that the Canadian
National management had decided to proceed with completion of the Dorchester street
terminal and was not influenced by the Government. In my view the two newspaper
extracts which I have placed on Hansard do
not so indýicate. On the contrary, they imply
very clearly that the suggestion came from
Ottawa, not from the railway management.
It would appear that when the President of
the National Railway made bis first public
announcement in connection with the matter
an inspired statement was put into bis bands,
and that the decision arrived at was not the
original decision of the Canadian National
management. I have no written proof for
my statement, but I have pretty good
authority for making it.
But if I need support, I have but to refer
to an announcement made by the Minister of
Finance in the House of Commons on February 6 last. To me it is a sad admission for a
Minister of the Crown to make, but apparently
he felt be had "to let the cat out of the
bag." Let me give honourable members Mr.
Dunning's own words as they appear in the
Commons Hansard of that date:
All I desire to say, Mr. Speaker, is this, and
this is a really serious word. The administration
of a great public utility demands a degree of
restraint on the part of all of us to which
none of us in this Parliament has so far proved
EDITON

4Ô8

SENATE

equal. That is my firm belief. No matter
which party of us is in opposition we do
belabour the Government politically witi respect
to the administration of this utility. That lias
been the history to date. I mention it merely
in order that in this time of great difficulty
we may all look at it in a different fashion.
There is no subject upon which, in the
interests of Canada, we require more heart
searching than in regard to statements we
make with regard to our great public-owned
utility.
That may be termed an honest, but certainly it is a very unfortunate apology for a
Minister of Finance to have to make. He
had been severely criticized for what many
members of the other House considered was
an extravagant expenditure, unwarranted from
every standpoint.
As I have said, I was disappointed with the
results of the committee's work this session.
Perhaps the very fact that the situation to
which J have referred arose during an election
campaign in Montreal embarrassed those
members of the committee who would naturally support the Government, and placed
them in such a position that it became virtually impossible for the committee to secure
evidence of value with respect to the Montreal terminal. I brought the question up
in the committee, and I was told, "You are
not going to be allowed to poke your nose
into the Montreal terminal." I resented that
expression ut the time, and I still dislike it.
If there was any purpose at all in appointing
the committee, it was surely to inquire into
the best means of relieving the taxpayer, to
some extent at least, of the heavy burden of
taxation due to recurring railway deficits. If
the spending of millions of dollars on a passenger terminal in the city of Montreal was
net a fit subject for discussion before our
conmittee, thon I have no lesitation in saying
that we had no right to be there at all. When
that intimation was giveii I lost interest in
the proceedings, for I felt it was useless to
proceed to discuss further ecomies in railway operation once the political element was
allowed to influence the Canadian National
management.
Hon. Mc. LACASSE: J should like to ask
the honourable umeuiber to naine the man
who gave iim that warning.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: What warning?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: "You will not be
allowed to poke your nose into this Montreul
terminal.'
I should bo interested to know
whether ho was told that by a man opposed
to any improvements there.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh. oh.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I would suggest that
the honourable niember ask his own leader.
He will doubtless get direct information there.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is where
you got it.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

That changes the

aspect altogether.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The honourable gentleman can go right to the source of information. I cannot give him a more direct answer
than that.
I do not want to make this a party question at all. but I do think it is my duty
to call attention to what I regard as a most
serious situation in relation to the control of
our railways. I refer to the practice of bringing polities into the question. In this respect
I criticize the party to which I give allegiance,
just as much as I criticize the party that sits
opposite. There have been times when we
have tried to get our skirts clear of the political mess, but we seem to have been dropping
back into it again.
As I said before, I am not at all satisfied
with what bas been donc in the committee
this year. I have net been able to discover a
solution which satisfied me.
The second
report presented recommends unification of
management, and that is all. There is a
great deal of misapprehension as to wliat that
means. I an net going to try to explain it,
because I know there are some people who
continually misrepresent the facts. Others are
honestly mistaken.
I see no real financial difficulty in the way
of bringing these two railroads under one
managemient. I bave had a long and net
altogether unsuccessful business experience,
and can see no reason whv there should be
complications in that respect. Neither of the
railwa vs would have to endorse the bonds or
notes of ilit other. So far as their financial
obligations are concerned, they could be kept
entircly separate. The great difficulty I see
is of a quite different kind. It seems to me
a question of whether the public have reached
the stage wlhere they are prepared to have
one management for the two roads. The
threat of monopoly is just a bogey; it is nonexistent.
Seventy per cent of the short-haul freight
is carried by motor-truek, and I am told that
about eighty per cent of the short-haul passonger traffic goes by bus and private motorcar. In addition to this. long-haul freight is
to an ever-increasing degree being carried by
motor-truck. The highways are built by and
for the public. We may say that the public
should not ho allowed to use them for the
transportation of freight. But why not? The
public, who built the highways, built also
the Canadian National Railways, and if they
choose to use the highways as the system
which serves them best, why should they not

459

MAY 25, 1939
do so? There is no doubt that for short
distances the motor vehicle does the business
better than the railways can ever do it.
Furthermore, motor vehicles are increasing
in speed and in comfort, and every day the
cost of operating themn is decreasing. It will
not be long before the Diesel engine is generally applied to the motor-truck and the
motor-car, and when that time cornes the
cost of fuel will be greatiy reduced. Some
people say the cost of oil as cornpared with
the cost of gasoline will be about as one to
eighteen. I arn using two Diesel engines myself, and the cost of operating thern is ridiculously low.
Then there is the aeroplaùe. More and
more the acroplane will cut into long-distance
passenger traffic. It will save daye in getting
people to their destinations, and in these times
the saving of days is a niatter of some
importance.
Furthermore, it will not be long before
there is a transcontinental highway. In fact,
it is pretty near at hand now, and I arn not
at ail sure that wheat will not be rnoved
fromn the West to the head of the lakes by
motor-trucks. In the West and also in the
East, beef, which used to be rnoved by the
car]oad, is now transported by motor-trucks.
The same is truc of -many other commodities.
For the last ten years I bave tried to give
ail the, freiglit I could to the Canadian
National. In doing so I have sometimes gone
very much against my Scotch principles, the
cost by railway being more than the cost by
motor-truck. The roads are paved and are
open the year around, and the trucks can
carry many commodities much more advantageously than the railways can do it. I can
see no reason why the volume of motorcarried freight should decrease, and I look for
no solution of the pro.blem of our railways
in that direction.
Certain suggestions have been made for cutting- down railway operating cost by -means
of co-operation, and thus reiieving the taxpayers, t.o some extent at ail events. As
betwcen the proposai submitted by the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) and the one submitted by the
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) there is very little difference.
It is just a question as to which is the better
rnethod' of attaining our objective-c-o-opera-.
tion, or the unification of management under
the supervision of the Board of Railway Commissioners. Let us discard ail the side issues,
and the supposition that the railroads cannot
be run under one management. They can. It
is just a question as to which method will
work the more effectively and efficiently.
71498--30à

I arn going to support the proposai of the
honourable senator from, Montarville for no
other reason than that the indications are,
according to the evidence adduced before the
committee, that by unified management we
shall get resuits more quickly than hy cooperation. During six years cu-aperation baa
produced nothing, and my great fear is that
during the next six years it would produce
very littie more.
In closing 1 should .iust like to say this.
If any honourable senator in this Chamber
has a better suggestion to make than those
which have been submitted to us, I will vote
for it and against the others. Let us try our
hest to eliminate considerations of political
patronage, political advantage and political
disadvantage affecting our actions. If the
Senate of Canada does that alone, it will be
rendering a very great service to the Dominion,
a service which will be remembered long
after we are gone, and will do much to purify
the public life of this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. ADRIAN K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, perhaps my first word should he
one of appreciation of the great honour I have
enjoyed in being allowed to serve on thîs
Special Railway Committee, perhaps one of
the most important committees appointed by
this body during the last few years. If I
might say a personal word it would be that
I was particularly glad to be allowed to serve
on this committee, inasmucli as I have always
been extremely interested in ail matters pertaining to transportation. In fact, were it
flot for one of the railways of Canada I should
flot be occupying my seat in this Chamber at
this time, since it was for the purpose of
taking a position in one of the Canadian
railroads that I first came to this country as
a xery young man more. than thirty years
ago.
The impression made upon my mind by
the evidence adduced before the Special Railway
Committee was this. The many witnesses we
heard dealt with the same set of facts, but
some of themn came to very opposite conclusions. This brought to my mind an expression used by Lord Baldwin in the House of
Commons in England when he was Prime
Minister. One of bis ministers had been
accused of making a statement not strictly
in accordance with the facts. On that occasion Lord Baldwin referred to what be called
"the many-sidedness of truth." While listening to the witnesses who examined the facts
frm various angles and came to different
conclusions I was led to think of the applica-

460

SENATE

tion of those words to the witnesses as an
example of "the many-sidedness of truth."
I have no intention of going at great length
or in detail into the evidence produced before
the committee, but I do wish to examine for
a few moments some of what, to my mind,
are the fundamental factors in the railway
problem of this country.
The first observation I would make is this.
In view of the geographical position of the
country, it would be surprising indeed
if Canada did not have a railway problem.
Our centres of population are spread out
for a distance of more than 3,500 miles along
the border of the United States, but very
seldom at a distance exceeding one or two
hundred miles north of that border. In other
words, we have length without breadth. That
condition, of course, means that our railways
have had to be constructed over very long
and in places very sparsely populated areas
of country.
Furthermore, the country is divided into
four clearly narked areas-the Maritime Provinces, the central provinces of Quebec and
Ontario, the Prairie Provinces, and the Pacifie
province of British Columbia. Between each
area and the next there is a formidable natural
barrier. The mountains of Gaspé separate
the Maritime Provinces from Quebec; the vast
area of lake and rock and scrub pine north
of Lake Superior divides Ontario from the
Prairie Provinces; the Rocky Mountains
form an eternal and almost impenetrable
barrier between the Prairie Provinces and the
Pacific coast province of British Columbia.
All this means that our railways have to be
built oxer long distances and across areas in
wlhich engineering difficulties are great and
which in thcemselves are incapable of producing the traffic necessary to sustain those lines.
There are also economie considerations.
Naturally the volume of trade in the different
areas of ouir own country would flow south to
corresponding ai-cas in the United States.
Normally, the direction of traffic on the North
American continent would be north and
south. But for national reasons we have
turned it around and made it travel in an
unnatural direction, cast and west. We have
had to do this for the purpose of binding the
various parts of the country together into one.
The development of Canada can be said to
be largely the history of a struggle against
geography. and I think it is not too much to
say that the railways have been, are, and will
continue to 'be, the life-line keeping the
country together.
That brings me to the remark that the
railway problem cannot be segregated; cannot
be put into a corner by itself and considered
In.

Mr. HUGESSEN

by itself. It is a part of the whole problem
of the national development of this country.
Now, I have referred to the natural barriers
which make our railway position difficult.
There are certain further economic factors
which should be taken into consideration.
Firstly, we are a great exporting country.
We export to the markets of the world very
large quantities of products, some of them
from the centre of the country. Consequently
our railways are called u-pon to transport
them to the seaboard of the Atlantic or the
Pacifie at rates which are low enough te
permit them to compete with the products of
other countries in the markets of the world.
A second factor is this. We are still largely
an undeveloped country. In certain sections
of the Dominion, for colonization purposes,
we have built lines to open up new stretches
of land. We have also built lines for development purposes, in order to reach some of the
natural resources and products. In the normal
course of events these lines, in themselves,
could not be expected to pay.
All these observations lead me back to the
remark with which I began, that Canada, of
all countries, is the one in which you would
naturally expect a railway problem to exist.
Then of course we are confronted vith the
new problems w-hich face railroads in every
country of the world, problems resulting frem
the developient of new sources of competition
from the highways, airways, waterways, pipe
lines, and so forth. As so often occurs in the
consideration of our own national affairs, we
can profit by the experience of the country
to the south of us. The other day I happened
to run across an article dealing with the general
subject of railways in the United States,
and it appeared to me to contain a number
of points equally rele.vant to our own situation.
The article. entitled " Transportation Developments in the United States," was written by a
Mr. Frcd Lavis, a member of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, and was published
in the Proceedings of that society for November, 1938.
Mr. Lavis makes a number of
points which I think would be of interest to
the House, but I (1o not intend to weary
honourable members by quoting at length.
The first of these points relates to a matter
that has been discussed by several honourable
members in this debate, namely, the extent to
which motor carriers have superseded the
railways in the carriage of freight. In a table
showing the total tonmiles of freight carried
in the United States during 1936, the last year
for which figures were available at the time
he wrote his article, he shows what proportions
of the total were distributed among the various
transportation agencies: steam railways, waterways, motor carriers, petroleum pipe lines and

MAY 25, 1930
electrie railways. From this table it appears
that even in 1936, after a great development
of these competing methods of transportation,
the American railways still carried 67j per cent
of the total freight moved.
Then he proceeds to discuss the question
of the cost of rail transport as compared with
road transport, and he says this:
In general, the average cost (to the shipper)
of freight hauled on the railroads is slightly
less than one cent per ton-mile, whereas the
cost of haulage by truck is from five to seven
cents per ton-mile.
Then he makes an interesting calculation
designed to show what would have to be
done if the freight now hauled by railroads
were to be moved by motor carriers. He takes
a division of the Pennsylvania Railroad
extending between Pittsburg and Altoona and
calculates that if the freight moved over that
division on a representative day in 1938 were
moved by trucks, it would require from six
to twelve new first-class two-lane highways to
handle the traffic, the difference depending
upon whether the freight were to be
carried in five-ton trucks or in ten-ton
trucks.
He reaches the general conclusion that the railways are important not
only because they now handle by far the
largest proportion of the freight, but because
there now seems no other way in which this
traffic can be handled.
The next point of interest in this article
relates to increases of transportation facilities.
Mr. Lavis points out that between 1920 and
1932 the amount of capital invested in different
kinds of transportation in the United States
increased by approximately 100 per cent. In
1920 the investment in railways and so forth
was about 20 billion dollars, and by 1932, after
construction of great numbers of highways,
additional railways, and pipe lines, and
expenditures on internal waterways, the investment had gone up by approximately a further
20 billion dollars.
There is one further section in Mr. Lavis's
article which is perhaps germane to the consideration of the committee's report. This is
the only section of his article which I intend
to read textually. Under the heading of
"Suggested Remedies" he has this to say
about consolidation and co-ordination:
The questions of consolidation, co-ordination,
and competition are always foremost in any

where further consolidation may be desirable,
but these shoùld be studied as individual cases
rather than on the basis of some arbitrary
plan for the grouping of all the railroads of
the country, or of some section of the country.

If we accept the general conclusions of
this article, I think it would be fair to say
that for as long a time as it is given to man
to look into the future, the railroads in this
country, even more so than in the United
States, will be an essential and very large
factor in transportation services.
Now I should like to discuss for a moment
the capacity of the country to bear its railway
burden, as represented by the annual deficits
on the Canadian National Railways. I am
afraid that perhaps I may be regarded by
some honourable members as somewhat of a
heretic. We hear a great deal about the
tremendous burden of these annual deficits,
but I must frankly admit that I do not
believe that burden is as onerous or as formidable as it is sometimes made out to be.
After all, when you incur an indebtedness
there is always some sort of asset to show
for it. I was a good deal impressed by a
report of the remarks made two or three
weeks ago by Mr. Graham Towers, Governor
of the Bank of Canada and one of our most
brilliant public men, before the Banking and
Commerce Committee of the other House. He
was dealing with the general question of
public debt, and he said that debt is an asset,
in the sense that it represents something
which has been acquired. He pointed out,
further, that in every civilized country the
public debt is a very considerable one.
because the citizens of the country require
and insist that their governments shall provide a great number of services. By way of
contrast he referred to the natives of central
Africa, who run around, as Kipling once
remarked, wearing "nothin' much before, an'
rather less than 'arf o' that be'ind." They, he
said, have no public debt, and they enjoy none
of the amenities which a public debt represents in civilized countries.
I think some honourable senators-41 say
this with a great deal of deference-are apt to
have their vision obscured a little by the Canadian National's annual deficits, and therefore
perhaps do not sec the asset that lies behind
those deficits. After all, does not part of that
asset consist in the provision by our country
of an excellent transportation system at less
than cost? Of course, the difference between
what this asset costs and what it yields in
revenue has to be made up by means of
taxation.
To speak in a still broader sense, the deficits
on our Canadian National Railways can be
described as the price we pay for the unity
of our country.
We have been warned that if these deficits
continue year by year we may have to default

on our public debt and go into general bankruptcy. I remember reading-it must be at
least fifteen years ago-a statement made by
Sir Vincent Meredith, then President of the
Bank of Montreal, in his annual report to
the shareholders, to precisely the same effect.
He said that the country could not continue
to go on bearing those tremendous annual
deficits. As I say, honourable senators, that
was at least fifteen years ago. I venture to
think that in the meantime the country has
managed to carry the annual deficits of the
Canadian National Railways without too much
of a burden upon the public treasury, and
that the burden has not prevented a considerable increase in our national wealth.
When I am met with those dismal and
gloomy statements about our rapid pace along
the road to bankruptcy and repudiation, I like
to consider two or three facts, which I wish
to place before the House. As we were told
in the special committee, the Dominion
Bureau of Statisties estimated that, account
having been taken of all the factors that
could be considered in such an abstract
calculation, the national wealth of Canada
increased in 1937 by $200,000,000. A second
cheerful factor is the repatriation to this
country of our foreign debt. I quote from an
article which appeared in the New York Times
with reference to the monthly review of the
Bank of Nova Sceotia for March last. The
article says:
Due to the Dominion of Canada's large net
credit in international transactions in the last
five years, Canada is paying its external debts
"on a very considerable scale," according to.the
Bank of Nova Scotia in its monthly review.
Basing its calculations on figures of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, the bank places
Canada's net credit from 1934 to 1939, inclusive,

countries of the British Commonwealth:
Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman not realize that the
figures of our debt as compared with that of
Great Britain, Australia or New Zealand, do
net include our indirect railway obligations?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I beg my right
honourable friend's pardon. The Minister of
Finance was referring to the public debt,
in which the Canadian National Railways'
debt is included.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Such of it as
is represented as debt. The vast part of it
is represented, not as debt, but as guarantee,
and that is net in the public debt at all.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think my right
honourable friend is mistaken. If I remember
rightly, the public indebtedness of this country,
including the debt of the Canadian National
Railways, is approximately eight billion
dollars, and it was that figure which was taken
into account in the making of the calculation
I have quoted.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Certainlv.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Did the honourable
gentleman notice the comment made by
Premier Aberhart, of Alberta, with respect to
Mr. Graham Towers' statement?

enough to notice that.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: He said that if Mr.
Towers' statement was correct, this country

May I refer te another part of the same

capita public debt of this country is from
15 to 25 per cent lower than in three other

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As I was saying, I
think there is considerable support for the
view that the annual deficits of the Canadian
National Railways are net so important nor
vital, nor nearly so unbearable, as they are
sometimes made to appear.
It cannot but be admitted that taxation
is higher in consequence of the railway deficits
which we have te bear. We are sometimes
told that this high taxation is stifling private
enterprise and preventing industry from
forging ahead. I doubt whether it is a matter
of positive proof that high taxation does
stifle industry. It depends a good deal on
the type of taxation. The principal federal
taxation which industry has to bear is the
sales tax, which is passed on to the consumer,
and the income tax, which is levied only to
the extent that income is earned. There are
examples of countries with high levels of
taxation, even higher than our own, which

points out that the surplus has been chiefly
utilized in reducing Canada's foreign indebtedness and only to a limited extent in increasing
her external investments and other assets.
A reference to this same matter was made
by the Minister of Finance in his budget
speech delivered in another place on April 25
last. He said:
It is not generally recognized, I think, that
as a result of such transactions Canada has
been a net exporter of capital to the extent of
over $900,000,000 during the last five years.
This is a tribute to our inherent financial
strength and an evidence of increased ability
to withstand financial storms in the future.

Hon. Nr. HUGESSEN.

nevertheless have managed to achieve a very
considerable degree of prosperity.
One
eýxample cornes to rny mind at once: it is
the prosperous condition which existed in
Great Britain from about 1930 until a year
or two ago, and that at a time when its
taxation was on a higher scale than ours. I
do not believe our taxation is any higher
than that of other countries similarly situated.
The difference, it seems to me, is this--and
it is really the fundarnental point of tihe
whole thing-that by reason of the geographical and economic position to which. I have
referred we have to spend more of our
national income on railway transportation.
I want to deal for a few moments with the
particular problem before the House. Like
the honourable senator who has preceded me
(Hon. Mr. Black), 1 arn half of Scotch
descent, anid I resent undue waste of publie
rnoney.
We were met in the cornmit'tee by a large
number of witnesses, particularly witnesses for
the Canadian Pacific Railway, who supported
the plea for unification and told us that from
this plan, on the basis of trafflc in 1930, we
could expect annual savings of $75,000,000, or,
on the revised basis of the level of traffie in
1937, savings varying from $56,000,000 to $59,000,000, depending upon whether certain railroads were abandoned or not.
1 have the greatest admiration for those
witnesses. I believe they gave their evidence
in perfectly good faith, and I wish I could
participate in their enthusiasrn.
I do not
believe the savings which they suggested could
in fact be made under unification. It is of
course difficult to test the accuracy of theoretical estimates, but I did make one attempt
to test this estimate of $59,000.000. For the
benefit of the honourable senator frorn
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) I may say
that I did this without help frorn anyone and
with such limited intelligence as is perrnitted
to me. If you assume that unification had
been completed by 1937 and was in operation
in that year, and that haif the savings of
$58,000,000 accrued to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, then, applying those figures to the
actual operating figures of the company for
1937, you get some rather surprising results.
In 1937 their income from railroad operation
was approxirnately $145,000,000, and their
working expenses were 3121,000,000, which
gave an operating ratio of 83-6 per cent. As
honourable members know, operating ratio
is a terni very commonly used ini railway
parlance throughout this continent and refers
to the numnber of cents spent to earn a
dollar. For 1937 the Canadian Pacific Railway actually spent 83-6 cents to earn a dollar.
Now, on the assumption that unification had
been completed and was in full operation

463

in 1937, and that there had accrued to the
Canadian Pacifie Company as a result onehaîf of the $58,000,000, that is $29.000,000,, they
would presumably still have their gross earnings of $145,000,000, but would have 829,000,000 less of working expenses, and that would
give thern an operating ratio of 63-5 per cent.
Now, honourable members, that is a very
rernarkahle figure. The operating ratios of the
nineteen principal railroads of the United
States for 1937 appear at page 1185 in No.
20 of the proceedings of your committee.
Each of thera earned $75,000,000 or more. 0f
those, two only 'had. an operating ratio of less
than 63-5 per cent-the theoretical Canadian
Pacifie operating ratio: they were the Chesa.
peake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western.
I will elirninate those two railroads for the
reason that they operate under exceptionally
favourable traffle conditions and their
operating ratios have at aIl times been very
much less than those of the other lines, because
the. great proportion of their traffie is coal,
which they load in the mountains and rien
downhill to the seaboard at Norfolk and
Old Point Cornfort. I think it is generally
recognized in railroad practîce that railroads
which have such a particularly favourable
condition have always a very rnuch lower
operating ratio than lines engaged in general
traffie. I know it was the case before the
war with several lines in South Wales which
ran under sirnilar conditions down the coalbearing valleys to Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.
0f the seventeen remaining big lines of the
United States the actual operating ratios in 1937
averaged, 7,7 per cent, as against the theoretical
Canadian, Pacifie R-ailway operating ratio under complete unification of 63-5 per cent. 1
find it very difficult to believe that under any
system of co-ordination, co-operation, or what
you will, the operating ratio of the Canadian
Pacifie could ever be se very much less than
the average operating ratios of those class 1
lines in the United States. That was the first
test which I atternpted of the Canadian
Pacifie theoretical 1937 unification figures.
The second test erose from the saine set
of figures, which I carried through to the net
receipts of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
available for payrncnt to its shareholders. In
1937 the Canadian Pacifie, after payment of
aIl expenses, bond interest, taxes and sO on,
had a balance available for its shareholders of
$9,000,000 odd. Let us take the additional
829,000,000 in savings which they say they
would have achieved in that year under
unification and add to that the $9,000,000 which
they actually earned. That resuits in a figure
of about $38,000,000, which would be sufficient, after the paymént of dividends on the 4

SENATE
per cent preferred stock, to give a return to
their ordinary shareholders of very nearly 10
per cent. Again I must say I find it extraordinarily difficult to believe that in the
circumstances which existed in 1937, and which
affected all the railroads of the country, the
Canadian Pacific would have been able, under
any conceivable conditions of operation, to
earn practically 10 per cent on their common
stock.
I think what would happen if unification were
brought about would be something like what
we were told happened in Great Britain.
Honourable senators know that there in 1921
more than 120 lines were consolidated into four
large systems. In a memorandum which was
submitted to us, but which I could not lay
my hands upon before coming into this
Chamber, we were told that this is what
happened. When in 1920 the President of the
Board of Trade introduced into the House
of Commons the Bill for the unification of
the British railroads, he predicted enormous
immediate savings running into many millions
of pounds sterling. When it came to the
actual results from that pooling of the roads,
those savings did net appear; they vanishedthey were not there. The statement went on
to say it was undoubtedly the fact that there
had been very considerable savings since
unification of the railroads in 1921, but that
it had been impossible at any time to say to
what extent, if at all, those savings were the
result of unification, and to what extent they
were due to improvements in transportation,
and that the railroads themselves had never
attempted to allocate them in order to show
in anv wav what, if any, proportion of the
savigs had resulted from the unification.
It is a matter of conjecture. I think anybody will agree that unification would bring
about larger and quicker savings than voluntary co-operation. It is merely a question
of degrce for the people of this country to
determine whether they are willing to take
the risk which adheres to the policy of unification. Let us say for example-and this is
probably an outside estimate-that the savings
on the railways from unification would be
$10.000,000 or $15,000,000 more than they
could be under voluntary co-operation. It is
then a question for the people of the country
to decide whether they wish to continue to
tax themselves to the extent of an additional
85,000,000 to 87,000,000 or $8,000,000 a year for
the purpose of maintaining the corporate entities of the two systems and avoiding whatever
dangers might result from unification and
froin the monopoly which would thereby be
occasioned.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

The people of this country are, I think,
instinctively opposed to so vast a monopoly
as would be created by the unification of
the two systems. I fully agree with the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) that as regards service there would
probably be as good service under unification
as there is to-day. But it is not in the type
of service that danger would arise.
The
danger would arise from having a single
industry with 120,000 employees and with
S300,000,000 to spend in the country each year.
That would be a state within a state. It is
quite conceivable there might be a great
deal of political danger in setting up so vast
an entity as that. I am a democrat, I believe
in democracy, and I believe that normally the
instinct of the people in matters of this kind
is right.
But, quite apart from the immediate effects
of unification, there are certain inherent
dangers in that policy, and, in all humility,
I should be disposed to ask honourable senators who favour that policy whether they are
quite sure whither it will lead them. It is
my belief that unification would sooner or
later. and probably sooner rather than later,
lead to purchase of the Canadian Pacifie Railway and government ownership of the entire
rail system of the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As soon as unification hiad been brought about there would
immediately be an urge for the purchase of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and that woukh
come from two quarters. It would come froi
the security holders of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company whenever there was any
question of making a capital expenditure on
the railways which might be considered in the
national interest, net one which showed an
imumediate cash return.
Froi
the labour
unions also would come a demand for the
purchase of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In
that connection let me call the attention of
honourable meinbers to what actually has
happened in Great Britain. We had before us
a few days ago in the committee a witness
who took the trouble to send a cable to the
bead of the National Union of Railway Men
in Great Britain, an organization representing
475,000 British rail workers. This is the cable:
Certain interests here urging Parliament
unify two large railway systems, basing argument on British practice. Please cable attitude
British railway men towards consolidation
already achieved, and if now advocating complete unification state on what basis.

MAY 25, 1939
This is the cable received from Mr. John
Marchhank, secretary of the National Union
of Railway Men:
Not satisfied with existing consolidation of
the British railways and advocating complete
unification of ahl means of transport and
national ownership and control.
If I were a Socialist 1 should be in favour
of unification, because I should believe, and
I think truly, that it was one step towards
what I intended ultimately to achieve, that
is, complete government ownership of the
railways of Canada.
I sometimes doubt whether honourable
memibers appreciate the value of our present
position, with two separate railway systems in
thîs country, one owned by the ýGovernment,
the other privately owned. Each of them is
a yardstick of the achievements of the other.
We can measure what one dues by what the
other does; so we have a very valuable means
of ascertainiug which system is doing the better.
I believe to a certain extent in the virtues of
competition. There are of course ail kinds
of competition. I think our two railway companies could achieve a competition which is
neither wasteful nor unnecessary, and that by
agreement they could eliminate ail that
remains of waste and unnecessary services.
If the executive officers of the two railway
systems would stop this childish business of
making faces at eaeh other behind our backs,
they could, I think, achieve a friendly cooperation of service to the people of Canadathe real purpose for which they are here.
Honourable senators, I realize that I have
probably wearied the House by my extended
remarks on this subjeet. My only excuse is
its importance and the great interest I take
in it.
May I sum Up what I have said?
Firstly, that the railway pro'blem is inherent
to this country.
Secondly, that railiroad transportation is, and
will always continue to be, essential for the
country, not only because of the mere carrnage
of the freight of the country, but as a factor
iit our national unity.
Thirdly, that the burden of our railway
deficits is not unduly excessive, and is not
beyond the capacity of the country to bear.
Fourthly, that unification would not bring
about a financial solution, and inherent dangers
in it should make us very chary of adopting
that policy without a full knowledge of what
il. implies.
For these reasons I shahl vote for the
mai ority report of the committee.
I have but one more word to add. The
arduous work of the committee is now at an
end, and at its conclusion I suggest that

40à

the message of the people of Canada to, their
two railway systems should be this: Stop your
bickerings and your propaganda. We have
decided that you shall carry on as two separate
entities in friendly competition and co-operation. Under the Canadian National-Canadian
Pacifie Act of 1933 we have provided you
with the machinery necessary for that purpose. You are jointly charged with the vitally
important task of providing our country with
adequate railway fitcilities with as littie
unnecessary waste and duplication as possible.
Get on with the job!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable senator allow me a moment? Does he
not think that the passage of the Act compensating railway employees who may be laid
off as a resuit of co-operation will go a long
way towards chýecking or possibly stopping
altogether any further voluntary co-operation?
I arn sure my honourable friend read the
views of the various unions in the United
States and Canada which I quoted. They
stressed the point that if What was proposed
under that Bill could 'be accomplished it
would go a long way towards stopping voluntary co-operation.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I was very much
interested in, and quite appreeiated, the remarks
of my honourable friend on that topic. Of
course that argument would apply equaýlly to
unification. But Sir Edward Beatty did not
seem to think that was an insuperable obstacle
in the way of ultimately achieving, through
unification, the savings he mentioned.
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE: Honourable
senators, I have heen listening with increasing
interest to the addresses delivered in this
Chamber on the ever-present problem of
Canada's railways. Although not a member
of the special committee on this subject,
I attended most of its sittings and listened
to practically aIl the evidence that was given
hefore it. 1 have also read many newspaper
reports of speeches made outside of this
House.
ýOne of the last opinions puiblicly expressed
was that which was voiced in unmistakable
termns *hy the memnber of the House of
Commons for the Yukon, Mrs. George Black,
hefore the Women's Conservative Association
of Montreal. She said:
The time is coming when politicians will have
to take that nettle in both hands. . . . Those
railways have got to be amalgamated.
This is an opinion that might be open to
debate. It commits the speaker directly to
one of several solutions offered by different
interests, a solution which was ahlIy expounded

4(j6

SENATE

yesterday by the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae).
During the sittings of the committee one
nem- expression, at least, crept into the
discussion. It is one that I thjnk may bring
us nearer to a clear view of the possible
solution which every citizen is awaiting in
anxiety and no littie discomfort. Someone
bas introduced the expression, "rationalization
of the railways." I should like to translate
that expression into simple language, as
"Igetting some common sense into our attitude
toward the railways."
Such a viewpoint,
giving fair and equal consideration to both
the government-owned and the privatelyowned railway system, would, I believe,
enable us to do away witb most of the evils
inherent in iboth systems, or, at an.y rate,
most of the evils whichi resuIt fromn the
neuos,,ity uf haviug both systems. I think
that viewpoint would 'be more in agreement
with the ideas of the man in the street, the
ordinary citizen who pays bis full share of
the costs of the railways and of aIl the other
disastrous things %vhich \1e and our colleagues
in the other House and our predecessors in
political life have inflicted upon him. It is
this vieivpoint of the man in the street, the
individual taxpay er, that I should like to set
forth in the few remarks which I contribute
to tlîis debate.
The whole question, te, my mi, can be
brought down to one single statement of fact,
namely, that we have to0 muchi railway
transportation in Canada. There lies the evil.
It hias ýbeen pointed out in both Houses of
the Canadian Parliament with un'failing
regulariîy for more than twenty years. It
mighit be said to resemble the weather in that
everyone criticizes it, but no one does anything
about it.
Everyýbody has agreed that the
situation is serious, but so far no one bas the
courage to prescribe the remedy to cure the
trouble.
I submit that this je not a matter for
panaceas and quack remedies. It is a straight
and simple question of putting common sense
int public administration. This je no political
prohlemi. It is a straight question of economies.
Tbe politician will object that any goveroment
which attemipted to solve this problemn would
commit political suicide. Perbaps so. But I
should be inclined to go furtber and say tbat
it is time a man arose in Canadian public
if e who bad sufficient courage to commit
political suicide if necessary in order to cave
this Dominion from national suicide.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: As Talleyrand
said, "Pesez les hommes, ne les comptez pas"
'weigh the men, do not count them." This
lion. Mr RAINVILLE.

is as applicable to-day as it was when the
words were first spoken.
Can sucb a personality arise at tbis moment?
For all we know, the man may be sitting in

tbing we may be sure: if we politicians do
not find. bim, the people will sonner or later,
and it wilI be a sorry day for us if the people
impose him upon us.
I might remind ýmy bonourable bearers of

national crisis, a littie over two decades ago,
chose duty rather tban party, thus sacrificing
bis political career that Canada might live.
Sir Robert Borden lived and died bonoured
and esteemed tbroughout this Dominion and

Some Hon. SENATOLIS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I grant you we
cannot discuss a problemn like Canada's railway burden witbout taking cognizance of
the upheax aI which the whole world is going
through. and which affects social, economie
and political conditions in aIl nations. This
lias frequently come to the surface in this
Ichate. particularly wlien wc hav e run into
discussions on the merits or demerits of public
ownership.
I arn no 'partisan of public ownership. I
bave many reýasons for not favouring it. The
principal one is its dismal failure wherever
it bas heen tried. But in this connection
honourable 'scnators will. no douht. listen with
intereýt to a quotation from an article by
Louis Rougier, published in La Revue de Paris
under tbe titie "France, réveille-toi'-"France,
awake!" Mr. Rougier speaks of a return to
"liberalism." This word. obviously, je taken
in the philosophical ceose, not in tbe narrow
sense associated with it in Canadian party
polities. He says:
A return to liberalism cao be accomplished
only by a reversal of publie opinion, wben the
individual will at last realize that public ownership is nothing but a lure; that the public, far
f rom beneflting f romn its own bounties, is only
the wasteful paymaster of the system, and its
too complacent victim.
By maintaining fantastically onerous administration macbinery, a police system excessively
annoying to the public; by supporting bankrupt
enterprises with subsidies and at the expense
of the wbole eeonomy; by running vast nationalized enterprises at a loss; by tbe practice of
an economnic policy evolving from protectionism.
to probibitionism, public ownersbip, always
short of money, devours the country's savings
and leads the people into gencral misery under
ever-increasing restraint in the midst of growing
insecurity.
Quoting at length fro*m Roman history,
Mr. Rougier in one place cites the last words

MAY 25, 1939
spoken by Septimus Severus to his children,.
when he was on his death-bed: "Remain
united, pay the soldiers, and ignore the rest."
Mr. Rougier continues:
It is of no avail. In trying to save its own
life, the State has lost the very reason for its
existence. Oreated to serve the commnunity, it
condernns the community to live only for the
State. Miseries are on the increase, homes
are sterile, there is lack of funds, a shortage
of soldiers...
Some honourable senators may believe *I
have wandered far -froým the subjeet, but I
would remind themn that, as I said at the
beginning, we are dealing not only with a
problemn of maijor importance, but also with
a multitude of new conditions which render
its solution at once more imperative and more
difficult. For instance, the transportation
problemn in Canada and also in the United
States has been rendered more serious by the
entry of several new forms of competition
into the field. New competition bas corne
from airways and through developments in
water transport, but the most serious coinpelitors of all are motor-trucks and automobiles. Their competition bas grown to
such an extent that we, are justified in speaking
of two main forms of transportation: railways
and motor carriers. We cannot deny that
highway transportation is here to stay. For
that reason the railways simply have to adapt
themselves to the new conditions.
A few salient facts and figures -may throw
fresh light on tbis aspect of our transportation
problem. In 1907 there were 2,130 motor
vehicles in Canada, and by 1930 the number
had increased to 1,250,000. At the present
day there are in our country 400,000 miles
of highway, of which more than 80,000 are
gravel-surfaced or better. The nation bas to
provide over $100,000,000 every year to keep
highways in proper condition for motor
vehicles, whereas the railroads construct and
maintain their own rigbt-of-way, tracks,
stations, telegraphs, and so on.
May I be permitted to refer to a personal
experience which I had last faîl wben motoring
fromn Montreal to Toronto? I had been told
that a large number of trucks were operating
between those two cities, and at Kingston,
after dinner, I decided to count the trucks
going tbrougb towards Toro.nto. Between
8 o'clock. and fifteen minutes past midniight
I counted 88 west-bound truck trains, that is,
trucks composed of three sections. Sucb a
large movernt represents very serious coinpetition for our railways. I suppose the
quantity of goods carried by that numnber of
trucks was more than could be hauled from
Toronto to Montreal by the Ibiggest railroad
engine.

467

More recently I had another experience. I
live in the small but very patriotic town of
St. Lambert, and in driving to my Montreal
office I have to pass over the Victoria bridge.
In the spring of the year ail trucks approaching
that bridge are stopped and weighed, in
accordance with provincial regulations requiring that vehicles shall fot be so heavy as to
break down the highways. One day, when the
road was icy, I noticed that a big truck which,
had corne fromn Malone was gettinýg weighed,
and I learned that it was carrying a load of
53,000 pounds. The chauffeur was brought
before the courts and fined 8100.
Now, honourable senators, when the provinces originally undertook to huild highways there neyer was any intention that taxpayers should furnish owners of motor-trucks
and auto-buses with a means of livelihood.
Settlement of the railroads' troubles calîs for
a solution of the general transportation
problem. This, be it not forgotten, is a
problemn which our legisiators have had
before their eyes the past twenty years, and
every year it has become worse. It is a harsh
fact, and one that we cannot escape, that
while our .highway transportation is growing in
scope and importance every week, there still
are in this country 48,851 miles of railroad
and 256,000 railroad cars. The Canadian
people have in railways an investmnent of
more than $3,000,000,000, not to speak of
obligations assumed away back in the years
before Confederation.
Twenty years is without doubt a long time
for politicians of any country to look a
problem in the face and do nothing about it.
It is a short time in a nation's history, however, and the transportation problem can
therefore be called relatively new to Canada,
in comparison with the United States and
Europe.
References have been made in this debate
to railways in United States and England. I
should like to refer to the situation in France.
The railway problemn in that country has been
a nightmare for nearly haîf a century. There
the developrnent of the railway has always
had to be subordinated to the needs of
military strategy, on the one hand, and to
political expediency on the other. That coinbînation left France in complete possession
of a dense network of railways, the cost of
operation of which was nothing short of
frightful. In April, 1934, the French Government, finding their costly railway system
faced with competition fromn an equally dense
network of automobile services, had to take
serious action. Through Mr. Flandin, then
Minister of Public Works, legisiation was
passed inviting co-ordination of railway and

168

SENATE

highway traffic. The Government did flot
attempt to guide or regulate anything. They
simply offered to act as arbitrators whenever
negotiations reached a deadlock. They provided a very general plan of co-ordination,
leaving- interested parties to decide the hest
way of co-ordinating services in each case. The
basic principle set up was this: "The purpose
of co-ordination is to provide a maximum of
service at a minimum cost to the community;
the means adopted consist in attributing to
each mode of transport the traffic for which
it is more economicaliy suited."
The first understanding reached and, actually put into operation was in the lower Seine
region. wbere traffic is vcry dense and varied
and where the railway and highway networks
were competing to the limit. Mr. Dautry,
direetor of the -Northwestern Railways, wvas
responsible for the solution reaced in that
section of the country, covering both passenger and freight traffic. The main bases
of the agreement were: As regards passenger
traffic, the railway agreed to close ail small
uines andti o discontinue a notable part of
the local train services on main lines. The
highiway carriers, on the other hand. agreed to
ceasc competing with the railways as to longdistance and middle-distance traffie. In actual
fact. the railway suppressod passenger services on 517 kilometcrs of small lines, the
higlhway carriers agreeing to take care of
this serv ice and guaranteeing a service at
Jeast as gond as that given by the railway.
Betwveen Havre and Fecamp, for instance, the
s.ervice of thiree trains was replaced by that
nf twenty-six auto-buses.
Co-ordination of
railway and highiway rates was also svorked
out in a manner calculated to eliminate competition between lsigbway and railway. At
the saine time the railway agreed to accept
no freigbt of less than carload quantity at
stations closed to passenger traffic.
Local
freighit is shipped by rail to the open station
nearest destination, and there turned over to
the trucks for final delivery. Highway carriers bav e the exclusive right to handle aIl
less-thian-carload traffie at points not situated
on tise maiin lino between open stations.
"Open station" means a station open to al
traffie. It xsas agreed that on main lines the
raiiway sbould cake carload freight; on other
lines the freight was to be shared.
This is just one examplo of how the problem of railroad and highway competition is
being deait with in France. With this en-ordination strictly ap.plied, the Northwestern Railwavs of France saxv for the flrst time in their
operation a surplus to replace deficits accumulated during the previnus sixty-one years.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE.

Yet, witb ail this, the railway situation was
not mode quite secure, and in the end the
Government of tbe Republic adopted complete
railway unification, with fair guarantees to the
private investors in railways.
May I add that ail railways in France are
controlled by a super-board composed of
representatives of the different railways. Sufficient rates are guaranteed to pay a reasonable interest on the moncys invested in the
railways. If they are net sufficient, the Government provide such funds as may be necessary to make gond any deficit thereon.
Officiai figures show thiat in 1930 Canada's
railway revenues decreased about $12,000,000
frons the maximum attained somne four years
earlier. During the samne perind there was an
indicated trend of increase in miotor ve-hicle
carrier trqffie of about 25 per cent per annum.
Statisties can be adduced tu showv that

MAY 25, 1939
myself and most of the honourable gentlemen
listening to me-has been brought to the
stage of not only having to pay $60,000,000 a
year to keep a giant state railway fighting a
private competitor, but also having to pay
out whatever share of $100,000,000 a year
may be fairly attributed to trucks and buses
to maintain a highway transportation system
which is recklessly cutting the throats of the
other two.
I suggest, honourable members, it is time
we admitted that in so doing we have made a
big mistake. And it is time we settled down
seriously, not to argue about whose fault
this, that or the other thing is, but to consider
how to correct our mistake. Where is the practical solution? That is the only question that
has any right to occupy our further attention.
So far we have been satisfied to divide off into
warring groups, one favouring the Canadian
Pacific Railway and urging reorganization of
the systems, the other standing for the
Canadian National system and demanding a
status-quo policy, with intensification of publie ownership in the hope of a return to prosperity at some future date.
May I suggest that when you divide off
into two groups, each demanding adoption
of its own solution and flatly refusing to consider the solution offered by the other group,
you may bid a definite, if perhaps affectionate, good-bye to all hope of ever seeing a
solution, in terms of 1939 conditions, of a
problem created by a programme put through
many years ahead of its time, in a frenzy
of haste to construct thousands of miles of
superfluous railways. The world war cost us
$1,600,000,000, roughly, and has to a large
extent been paid by taxes. It is over. But
our little flutter in railways has cost us far
more than that, and all its debt is still outstanding.
I agree with most of the speakers who have
debated the subject in committees and on the
floor of either House that transportation is
the greatest of our national problems. It constitutes our greatest source of national uneasiness, fear and worry, and it is the heaviest
burden on our national treasury.
Personally, I do not think that state ownership and administration is the proper solution.
That system has against it an unsavory history
of patronage and political interference. We
have examples of it at our very door.
Now, why not a new organization, a private
institution controlled by the Government
through, say, a reinforced transportation commission or some such regulating body as would
guarantee the running of Canadian railway
services along practical, common-sense lines?
Remember, the distress of the railroads is not
due so much to conditions within the business itself as to conditions of publie policy

469

under whieh the railroads have to operate.
And, even if we desire to continue the present
insane railroad policy, how long can we expect
to do so, with every other public administration, federal, provincial or municipal, as has
been pointed out by the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), joining in
and discounting the future, and living well
above its means?
Even if the governments of Canada were
able to support this huge railway burden, it
still would not be economically desirable that
they should do so. But the plain fact is that
they cannot. So long as they show the same
extravagance in every other direction that we
indulge in with respect to our transportation
problem, we may be sure that all these activities together are co-operating to hasten the
arrival of that day of reckoning when all these
things will stop, whether we like it or not,
for want of the means to carry on any further.
In 1925, fourteen years ago, a special committee of this House suggested a merging of
the two railways for purposes of administration and operation. This seemed like a step
in the right direction. But so many great
and divergent interests were involved, that
nothing was done about it. The same thing,
practically, could be said of the situation
to-day. Nothing is being done about it,
because of the divergent and great interests
involved. And while we procrastinate in this
way, the people continue to pay the piper.
Two questions seem to arise at this juncture.
First, how much longer can the people of
Canada afford this sort of thing? And, second,
how much longer will they stand for it?
I said at the outset that it was the reaction
of the -man in the street that I wanted to give
this House. A recent writer in the Financial
Post, after figuring out the cost of our venture
in surplus railways in fifteen years, estimates
what could have been done with the money if
spent in other directions. He points out first
that in fifteen years the publicly-owned railway system cost Canada over a billion dollars.
He points out that no one ever saw a billion
dollars, and that no one can really conceive
how much money it is. But, if that billion
dollars had not been spent, the people of
Canada could have been spared every cent of
sales tax collected since 1923, every dollar of
the stamp tax, every dollar of the federal
taxes on automobiles, tobacco, cigarettes, beer,
and playing cards, and every cent that has
been paid in sugar tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend is about to close, we may continue.
If he is not, I suggest that he call it six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Call it six o'clock.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

470

SENATE

The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, when the House rose at 6 o'clock I was
referring to an article in the Financial Post,
in which the writer asserted that over a
period of fifteen years our venture into the
railway business had cost us one billion
dollars, which had to be made up out of taxes.
Every cent of all those taxes during that
period, he points out, went to pay the cost of
the experiment in railroad business by
politicians, including my honourable friends
and myself and all other members of Parliament. But, make no mistake, the man in the
street wastes no time on being polite with us.
He bluntly and plainly refers to what we have
done as " playing at railroads." And he thinks
rather bitterly of the increased old-age pensions, better living standards, unemployment
insurance, workmen's compensation, health
insurance, better education and housing, and
all sorts of other worth-while things he could
have had out of that billion dollars, had our
politicians been contented with a less costly
railway policy.
Here is the situation, briefly stated, from
another angle.
We have a total railway
mileage of 42,308 miles for 10,394.196 population, which, in 1930 comprised 7,346,404 people
in the East and 3,047,792 in the West. Yet
our railway mileage is so distributed that the
West. with less than one-third of the population, has 22,440 miles of railway, or 2,572 more
than the East. In other words, 29 per cent of
the population has 53.2 per cent of the
raihvay m ileage. Such a situation has no
parallel in the whole world. As a matter of
fact. Quebec is the only province of Canada
which shows an average of population to rail
mileage above the economic safety line, with
589 personýs per mile.
It serves no useful purpose to dig once
more into the causes which have brought us
to this impassc. We are faced with the fact.
We haxe to find a solution. That is all. It
is not the govcrnment of some old, decadent.
worn-out nation of central Europe or the
Near East, run ragged by centuries of despotism and exploitation, which is faced by this
appalling situation. The problem pertains,
not to one of the old nations. which have
nothing to gain and therefore nothing to
lose, but to the most hopeful and most promising of the young and growing nations in the
world to-day, the nation which of all countries
in the world bas most to gain in the future,
and therefore most to lose. Let us hear what

to say of our country during the great depresH<n.

sion, from which the world has not yet
recovered. In April, 1935, France-Amérique,
of Paris, said:
Economic recovery is more pronoudiced in
Canada than in most other countries.
Colonel Ayres in the Cleveland Trust Bulletin of 1934 said:
The improvement continues more progressively
in Canada than in the United States.
In 1934, Roger Babson, of New York, whom
we all know, said:
Of all the countries of the world, Canada
is one of those which were the quickest to
come out of the crisis.
Let me quote from Liberty of February
15, 1936:
Canada rounds the first lap of 1936 far in
advance of any other nation-a record pace in
the international marathon back to better
times.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) told us yesterday that
he was glad to be a Canadian. I would add
that we are all lucky to live in Canada. We
have one of the richest countries of the world.
Our inmnmense fields lie iWaiting for hands to
cultivate them and people to consume their
produets.
Our millions of horsepower lie
asleep in the waterfalls that pour daily, hourly,
into oblivion for want of industry to use
their power.
Our subsoil is replete with
metals of all kinds, precious and base, awaiting only dynamite and the crushing mill of
the miner. We have, to cite but a few
instances, almost a worlil monopoly of nickel
production; the great bulk of the world's
supply of asbestos; we rank amongst the
world's biggest producers of gold, silver, copper. There is no country in the world that
can compote with us in the production of
radium. At the price at which we can produce it. we have practically a world monopoly. Canada, with its 10.000,000 population,
is ie fifth nation in international commerce.
And we have thousands of square miles, the
contents of whose subsoil we do not even
know, in many cases do not even suspect,
and have never had time or opportunity
properly to investigate.
Should this country, the envy of the world,
he talking poverty? Should it be taxed to
death? Is it decent that a country like this,
in the prime of its early youth, awaiting a
little capital, a lot of energy, courage, brawn,
mus(le and brain and a healthy manhood to
develop it and bring ont its wealth. should
be strangled while its transportation problem is kicked about by groups of politicians,

like a football, instead of being deait with as

solution?
Let me state the prablem again, in as few
words as possible. We have too much transportation for the number of our people. We

The argument has been advanced that the
Canad.ian Pacific are not trying with any great
fervour to make co-operation a success, and it
is not unreasonable to reach that conclusion,
for of course if co-operation is a success there
will be no further argument for unification.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: There has been
some controversy about the propriety of the
Canadian National Railway officials taking
a hand in public discussions on this question. If that viewpoint prevails, there is very
great danger that the public and members of
Parliament will by continued propaganda be
gradually brought to what may be a wrong
conclusion. In my opinion, the Canadian
National officials should be encouraged in
every way possible to go into the open
forum and present their side of the case.
The charge that they are interested in maintaining their own positions and salaries is a
flimsy one when one realizes how tremendously
interested are the officials of the Canadian
Pacifie not only in the maintenance of their
own salaries and positions, but also in their
pardonable desire to improve the financial
conditions of that great company.
What we all want, and what this committee has been trying to do for the past two
sessions, is to get as much truthful information as possible for our guidance and for the
information of the people throughout Canada.
I cannot understand the attitude of those
who seen to think it is necessary for the
Senate to lay down a definite line of policy.
One of my reasons for this is that the Senate
is not a governing body. It bas already done
a pretty good job in ventilating the views of
many thinking people upon our railroad problems. The whole of Canada was interested,
and the press continually kept the public in
touch with what was going on in the Senate
committee, and gave a fairly accurate synopsis of the evidence. Our proceedings came
to the notice of the members of the Federal
Government and of our provincial governments, who became keenly interested. In
my opinion it might be much better for the
Senate to draw no conclusions whatever unless we can draw a unanimous conclusion, and
one so satisfactory to all parties that it will
meet with the approval of the country and
be a sure guide for the future policy of any
Government.
As has already been pointed out, railway
problems are not peculiar to Canada, but the
Canadian railway situation has its peculiar
difficulties because of the geographical nature
and extent of our country and because of
our comparatively thin population.
Hon.

Mr. ROBINSON.

The Canadian Pacifie Railway is an outstanding company, and has contributed much
to the development of our Dominion. But
the contribution has been mutual: Canada in
the past has also contributed much to the
Canadian Pacific Railway. The fact that the
profits of that great company have been
reduced to the vanishing point is net the
fault of Canada or of the Canadian National
Railways. or of bad management by the company. It is the inevitable result of changes
in economie conditions practically all over
the railway world; and what applies in this
regard to the Canadian Pacific Railway applies
equally to the Canadian National Railways.
We are too apt perhaps to find fault, and to
make charges of extravagance. In my opinion both railways have been very well managed. and are being well managed to-day.
I think there is no one in Canada who
would net gladly see the return of prosperity
to both railroads. We all know that it would
be a good advertisement for Canada to have
the Canadian Pacifie Railway on the high road
to success. So my advice to that company
is to forget all about unification, waste no
more time upon it, attend to the business
of running a railroad, and endeavour to put
into effect as rapidly as possible an "honestto-Cod" system of co-operation which will
undoubtedly bring to both railroads most of
the benefits that could be obtained by unification. I say this. not as an opponent, but as
a friend. I am firmly convinced that unificatien is impracticable, indeed impossible. and
would only result in a confusion of interest
and a sad disappointment.
Now I should like to follow up the line
of thought already so well developed by the
honourable member from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae), and add to the picture he has
painted of what would happen in the future
if unification became a fact. and a saving of
sixty million dollars resulted therefrom. He
showed that the Canadian Pacifie Railway
would earn over 7 per cent on its common
stock, and that, on the basis of the past
year's performance, the Canadian National
Railways would still he in the "red' to the
extent of twenty-four million dollars a year.
To carry the illustration a little further and
capitalize the result to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, a little figuring will show that it
would be equivalent to a bonus of nearly
$500,000,000.
On the other hand, let us see a little more
clearly how it would affect the Dominion of
Canada. What about the consequent unemployment, the reduction in employees by the
thousand? Who ta-kes care of the unemployed?
While it may not be necessary actually te

MAY 25, 1939
dismiss many employees, what about the
shrinkage in available jobs for coming generations? There will be fewer jobs by the
tbousand. and Canada *must pick up the consequent burden and carry it ta the bitter end.
Is it any wonder that the Canadian Pacific
Railway is ail for unification, particularly if it
can manipulate the control. And that is one
of the dangers of such a plan-manipulation
of contrai. Under such a "marriage" the termi
"for better, for worse," bas a particular significance if there is a real unification and one unit
emerges. I arn afraid that flot even a Senate
Divorce Committee would have the power ta
grant relief. That fact must flot be overlooked. Then what? Strength wiil be given
ta the advocates of public ownership.
The honourable senator fromn Vancouver has
given an apt iliustration of what bappened
ini Great Britain with respect ta, tbe Grand
Trunk stock. A very large part of the Canadian Pacifie Railway stock is held in Great
Britain to-day. The President's last annual
report shows the following:
Per cent
Canada bo]ds...........12-75
United Kingdom and other British
countries............65-47
United States...........15-86
Other countries..........5-92
Holders of preference stock. .26-519 per cent
Holders of ordinary stock ... . 65-706 per cent
From this we must conchide that a forcible
expropriation of the Canadian Pacific Railway
systema would meet with sucb strong opposition, or with such a clever campaign as ta
value, that there could flot possibly be any
satisfactory result; and yet there is mucb
ground for the idea of eventual public ownership unless bath railways find the future bas
hope in store for them. I strongly feel that
it is almost as vital ta Canada ta bring
prasperity ta the Canadian Pacifie Railway as
ta the Canadian National Railway; but such
prosperity must not be one-sided.
Notwitbstanding ail that bas been said, and
tbe impatience dispiayed in sýome quarters
over the results so far attaineil by co-operation,
it is clear ta me that there is a very great
opportunity in co-operation, and I do not
complain so much over the small results s0
far accomplisbed. Caution is needed; and it
is quite possible, and indeed probable, that
too great baste would be more barmful than
belpfui. To reduce the costs of operation
'there must be a curtailment of employees

and some distress ta communities adversely
affected. Such. a proccss sbould be accomplished gradually, and, se, far as possible, an
opportunity sbould be given for readjustments.
Impatience is a wrong attitude ta take. Do
flot get ino a hurry, but keep steadily at the
task. It must not ha forgotten that the

problemns of unemploymient resulting from
contraction by the raiiways will be really
seriaus probiems, and that the burden. wili faîl
entirely upon the Dominion, not upan the
Canadian Pacific Railway.
I come therefore ta one phase of tbe
proposed unification wbich seems ta nie ta be
outstanding in its unfairness. It seems ta be
taken for granted tbat the Canadian National
Railway should nat expect mare than 50 per
cent of the savings achieved, and tbat that
railway would be lucky ta get so mucb.
A comaparison of property valuation, as given
in tbe annuai reports, shows that the Canadian
National bas about 50 per cent mare than
the Canadian Pacifie; and in view of the
shifting of the other burden of unemploymcnt

fromn the railways ta the ýGovernment, aur
own railway, wbich mýeans the Governmnent,
sbould not be ex'pected ta take any less than
two-thirds of ahl savings resulting from either

or unification. The tremendous

tbe other interest charges were taken care of.
Sa I would eall the attention of the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company ta the fact that
they bave the most ta gain from ail savings
made tbrougb co-operation, as well as by
unification.

In ýmy opinion, the repart of the Duif
Commission sbould not be lightly cast aside.
The members of that. commission., who had a
unique opportunity of examining the railway
problems, were unanimous, 1 helieve, in
condemning amalgamation, whicb is .practically

the samne as unification. The bonourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
quoted fromn their repart, but neglected ta
quote their conclusion.
He was impressed

with a part of the admirable and tborougb
review contained in tbat report, but apparently
thinks tbe conclusions are wrong. H1e may
bave been given an insight into the problems,
but I would ratber bank on tbe judgment of
the commission.
Now may I offer a word of comfort about
aur present raiiway situation witbout in any
way expressing satisfaction or belittling any

attempt at improvement.. We ail knaw bow
much the Parliament of Canada was cailed

upon ta vote hast year under the bead of the
Canadian National Raiiway-somewbere about
$54,000.000. Tbat bas been repeatedly dinned
inta aur ears. It is a large enougb sum ta
affect seriously tbe national budget, but it is
a long way short of tbe statement that the sum
was one bundred millions. It is onhy fair ta
ask if there is any credit side to the accaunt,

474

and, if so, what it amounts to. I do not
think that phase of the question received
much attention at the hands of the committee.
On making some investigations I was rather
surprised te find that, so far as I could judge,
the credit is larger than the debit, and it
would seem to me that our railway system is
really a very valuable property. My reasons
for this conclusion are based on items such
as the following. In 1938 the taxes paid were
$7,000,000. In addition to this there are the
sales tax, and the taxes paid by employees,
which would no doubt run into many millions. Then we must not forget the contribution which both railways make te the
country in the matter of freight rates. It
was pretty clearly established before the
conimittee that freight rates in Canada are
very low, if not the lowest in the world,
and that the contribution to industry through
that channel amounts to many millions of
dollars a year. Further, we must also take
into consideration the service which is given
to outlying districts and to branch lines which
never were expected to pay, and, not least,
the advantages whieh should be credited
particularly te the Canadian National Railway, in the opening up of new country, the
developing of mines, and the increase in the
national wealth of the whole Dominion as a
result of those railway operations. Then we
must not overlook the fact that last year the
Canadian National Railway paid in pensions
more than four million dollars. So I have no
hesitation in asserting that if a proper balance
sheet wcre struck, and skilled economists were
called in to give an estimate of the service
rendered by our railways, we should find that
the subsidy of $54,000,000 a year is more than
returned to tic Dominion in the operations
of our railways.
Speaking of subsidies, the money voted for
railways is net the only great national subsidy. There is a subsidy, paid annually by
the people of this country for many years,
which is so large that it makes the contribution to our railways shrink into insignificance. I refer to the unseen taxes which the
people of this country pay as a contribution
to industry, as a result of our protective
tariff, and from whieh no one can escape. We
have no accurate estimate, but I think I am
safe in saving that this contribution is net less
than 8300.000,000 a year, and possibly exceeds
$400,000,000. I am net objecting to this subsidy. It is in accordance with a settled policy
which has been in vogue for years.
There is another side to the balance sheet.
The building up of our industries has been
of very great importance to Canada, and I
trust that beneficial results are recompensing
us for the tremendous cost imposed upon our
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

country. This amount is net talked about,
because it does not come into any accounts;
nevertheless it is real. If one were to employ
the arguments of the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), it would
at once be seen that there are at least two
sides to a question.
Now, just a word about our publicly-owned
railway. It represents a worth-while achievement, and in my opinion is something to be
proud, of. Taking over a number of railroads which were virtually left on our doorstep
by bankrupt companies, as well as a number
of branch lines which were in a deplorable
physical condition, we spent money lavishly
upon them, and now we have a unified system,
maintained in good order, giving most efficient
service, manned by capable officials and
employees, and contributing to the country's
business in a way that perhaps many of us
fail to appreciate. To entangle this system
in seme sort of hybrid unification with even
such a company as the Canadian Pacifie Railway would be a fatal blunder. It would probably lead to government ownership under most
unfavourable conditions. Let us maintain the
freedom and independence of our railway, urge
more and yet more co-operation, and help to
restore the other great railway system to
prosperity.
I have no axe to grind. I have no business
or professional interest or stock in any railroad. But all my life bas been spent in close
contact with railway men. and I cheerfully
testify to the character. tbe industry, the good
citizenship and patriotism of all Canadian
National emplo'ees, whether in the shops. on
the tracks, aboard the trains or in the offices.
I believe they all stand ready to co-operate
towards solving the railway problem, if they
are given an opportunity.
Some reference bas been made te unified
management as, I suppose, distinct from unification. As I understood the evidence given
before our committee, the savings estimated
to accrue from unification would net be
obtained under unified
management.
I
gathered that but for the difference in control
of the roads, unified management is only
another nane for co-operation. And I make
bold to say that unified management would
net give the results expected from it.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honouralble members, while I value sincerely the
addresses, or most of them, which have been
delivered in this debate, I cannot say that I
rise with any sensations of pleasure to add to
the discussion. I feel rather a very real and
distressing sense of futility, because I think
I see the usefulness of this House under
serions reproach and the function intended

MAY 25, 1939
for us in the scbeme of Confederation reduced
largely to atrophy. I bad long ago resolved to
remove from my own mind every constraint
that would impede me in the exercise of my
soundest judgment as to how best to treat
this great business prablem; but I arn sorry
to say I find this session in thýe conduet of
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
witb respect to this question the intervention
of other than business considerations and of
regard for matters for which we were neyer
intended to have regard. He bas almoet a
unanimous following in support of the position
taken by bis party. Possibly I should flot
have ground for such complaint were it not
that the past conduct of himself and of those
wbo now speak with him shows tbey really
have flot reasoned about this subject in other
days as they now do; that tbe principles
wbicb bind them to-day did flot bind thern
but a very short time ago.
Fourteen years have passed since a committee of this House unanimously declared
itself in favour of unified management of the
Canadian National and the Canadian Pacifie
railways. It is true tbat the financial terms
then recommended would not now be considered by us, but the Senate favoured the
principle of unified operation. And it is only
six years since the basis of the Senate's
resolution of 1925 was again wholly approved
by the honourable gentleman who now leads
the buse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)Hon. Mr. DANDURAIND: And repudiated
by my right bonourable friend.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is only
six years since be said that while in bis
judgment some good might result from the
measure then under consideration, bie apprebended we should bave to return to the
principle of unified management at no distant
date.
At that time hie read a list of
advantages which would accrue if we did
return to that principle. Ail tbis hie repudiates
now. He says to me, across the floor, that
six years ago I did not favour unification, but
supported the bill then before us. That is
true. The whole *railway question had been
inquired into ýby a commission in which,' ini
common with the whole country, I bad entire
confidence.
That commission bad made
specifie and clear recommendations. Manifestly
in the state of public opinion at that time tbe
best that could be done was to give those
recommendations a fair opport&inity to produce
relief. However one might bave feit about
tbe prospect--and I -myseif bad hopes that
much more would be attained than bas beenit was certain that in the face of the commission's report there was nothing furtber we
could do than we did. I stated to Parliament

repeatedly that we could do nothing but try
to give effect to those recommendations and
see wbat would resuit. I pointed out that
in the case of great businesses between whicb
there was severest competition beneficial
effects bad heen obtained froïm co-operation
on a limited scale, and I expressed my belief
that in the railway field there was a sphere
witbin whicb co-operation could be made to
produce desiraible resul-ts, even wbile competition existed.
Well, we have bad six years of this so-called
co-operation, but the results achieved would
not fill tbe bollow of our hands. Both railways bave explained why more co-operative
measures have not been put into effect. But
the bonourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) refuses to accept the explanation,
or to be guided by the resuit. He tells us be is
agaînst unified management on principle, and
bie calîs upon bis followers to vote it down.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right hionourable friend is wrong. I do not ask anyone
to follow me, and I bave called no caucus.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- I do not
tbink it is hard for any of us to bear the
caîl, even though it is not addressed to us.
Results speak for themselves. The bonourable leader of the Government bas veered at
a right angle 'from tbe course hie took just
a few years ago, and bas avowed principles
directly contrary to those which bie twice
commended to this House.
The main reason wby participation in this
debate gives me no pleasure is this. I
find myself in direct and definite confiict with
the avowed platform of the party with whicb
I have been associated througb life and which
once I led, and with the leader of tbat party,
a man whose talents I admire and for whose
personality I bave affection. Performance
of my duty in these circumstances, witb no
organized body of public opinion anywhere,
in support, certainly cannot carry with it any
great pleasure. I had hoped that others on
both sides of the House could consider this
matter from its business aspects alone, and
thus enable the Senate to show this country
that we were seeldng to serve rather than
to follow.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In that I
have been disappointed. I proclaim now that
my words represent my own views and those
of the eight other members of the committee
who signed the alternative report recommended
by my honnurable friend from Montarville
(Non. Mr. Beaubien), and of any otber bionourable members wbo may vote with me.

476

SENATE

They do not represent the views of the party
with which. I have been identified, and they
are definitely and very foreefully disavowed
by the leader of that party himself.
It would be a waste of time to go far back
into history in order te develop a 'background
of to-day's condition. This I have done on
previous occasions. There are persons who
have flung at me a charge of pessimism,
of failure to see the bright side of this
country's destiny. The whole substance and
essence of the problema which. we now face,
and which has been described as the most
obdurate and dangerous cenfronting our
country, bas been false optimism. Who does
flot remember the optimism that swept our
Government in the early days of this century,
an optimismn out of which grew thousands
upen thousands of miles of railway which
to-day censtitutes the wreckage under whieh
we struggle? WVho does flot remember the
intoxication of the twenties, led by that
prince of ail optimists, Sir Henry Theroton,

under whose gay and garish leadership this
enterprise, the Canadian National Railwavs.
was sunk beneath $900,0000 of added debt
Iin fine
years?
To those twe cycles of
optimism we owe the railway troubles of
our time.
Ali! we are told, troubles of railways are
universel; the United States have them, the
Argentine bas them, Franco bas them, Britain
hYas thern. There is not one of those countries which bas the situation we have. Not
one of those eountries bcd railway burdens
ait the early time we hadl them. We were in
railwav troubles hefore the area of the railways wvas ever invaded by truck, bus or any
other form of niew competitien. The ordinary worries which beset industry overtaken
by new cempetition beset railways everywhere. But there are more than those tbings
to be evereeme in Canada. This Dominion is
tied by guarantees, by advances in scores, tens
and hundreds of millions of dollars, guarantees
and advances into wbich we tied ourselves
becauqe of the terrorso f tliose carlier years,
and because of that intexicating swirl in the
twenties of this century.
Those are the
special troubles of Canada, and it is those
which new we must attack.
We listened te the senator fromn Moncton
and the senater from Montreal tell us things
truly were flot so bad. They got the eue
from the senator who leads the House, who
said that cverything was just fine up to the
endl of the twenties. We -were getting along
se well up to the depression and, hie added,
if we just had 15,000,000 instead of 11p000,000
population we should be in a sort of railway
paradise-our troubles would be ove:r.
Right ilo. Mr. MEIGIIEN.

I regard our situation as serious to, a dark
and :portentous degree, and I do flot regard
it as any offset that we are a.ble to borrow
money cheaply to pay our deficits year by
year. I can look around in this country
at governmental units which not sa long ago
could do just the sanie, whose very facility

of borrowing spett the ruin in which now they
wallow-unjts even to the dimensions of a
province. Borrow, borrow-it was easy, and
so they continued te borrow until now they

are encompassed with the ignominies of
repudiation and the shadows of shame. Their
numbers would be far greater, even couinted
in provinces, if they had net had the reserveirs
of this Dominion on whicha to rely-if there
were net still a period within which we cen
borrow for them and borrow in ebixndance.
We poured $54.000,000 into the Canadian
National last year. " But," we are told, " it
is flot much. Wby, look at the taxes they
pay, $15,000,000 or 320,000,000, taxes from the
salaries of thecir officiaIs! This thing really is
nt a deficit. Look at the service we get, and
the Canadian National pav taxes te the
townýs." I heard seme time age that debt was
net a liability et ail, and I aem hearing much
the same to-nigbt.
If we are te couint services rendered as
something returned, we had better add te our
$54.000,000 outlay the many millions more,
hundreds ef them, wbich we pay for those
services.
But $54,000,000 really is net the figure. That
is the figure after the writing dewn that we
have been engaged in in previeus sessions.
They telli s, "Oh. (lent regard the Canadiani National the way yevnoiwould regard
a commercial rcad, thc Canadian Pacifie or
the New York Central. Much of this road
was built te unite Canada and for colonizatien purpeses.'
That assertion is truc. But
it is only two or tlïree sessions >sînce wc
wrote cff what was attributable te celonizatien, and whiat wvas clone te inite Canada.
WcV wrote off the who]e jntcrest on it as
well.
XýVe aidded a large nieasuire of this
write off te the debt of Canada instcad ef
te the, debt ef the r-ailç%ays, and we added a
wlîcle lot more in a vague eccunt called
pýlroprietors' equity." Why, the total is about
$2.000.000,000. And we did ail this tinder the
assurance that it wculd reduce capital liabilities
until we could look upon the Canadian National
as a commercial enterprise. Now, after we have
donc se, we are told: "Oh. dcn't look on us as
a commercial institution. Look ait the pioncering we are deing arouind the N'ýoranda mines,
look at the pieneering we are doing into the
once expected metropelis ef Prince Rupert;

MAY 25, 1939
look at ail these things." We are getting,
every country is getting, these services from
its ordinary roads. But we have to take this
hiuge sum out of our taxpayers' pockets year by
year, taking out more than ail the individual
income taxes of the whole Dominion. Still we
have bonourable members of this flouse telling
us that we really have no very great trouble,
that we are .iust marching with the rest of the
world through the difficulties of railwaysI
Wby, honourable members, figure out the
amount in cash that this Dominion bas
advanced to the Canadian National; neyer
mind the building of the Transcontinental
nor the Intercolonial; neyer mmnd these pioneer
political roads at ail; just tbink of cash
advanced and count the interest we psy
to-day out of the taxpayers' pockets on
the cash we .borrowed, and you have to add
$50,000,000 more every year as the cost to this
country of the Canadian National ]Raiiwaysl
When I face that situation, five and a half
years after we passed the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act, I ask myself, "Are we
able to conclude we have solved the problem?"
Can we bonestly look the taxpayer in the face
and say, "These troubles are behind us, the
legislation is there, and ail we need now is to
give a little advice Vo Mr. Canadian Pacifie
President and Mr. Canadian National Preaident"? Is there a man who sat in the committee tbrougb two sessions and who in the bottom
of bis beart has any belief wbatever in the
problem being solved if we do nothing more?
Hie may find difficulties in the way of any new
solution, but to say we have the job done
seems Vto simply to defy the plainest trutb
me
that ever appealed to the buman mmnd.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Every country is
trying Vo find a solution.
Right Hon. Mr. MF.IGHEN: I am talking
about Canada. I got rid of other countries
some tinie ago. Our problem differs fromi the
problem of every other country on earth, and
the reason it does dates from the false optimism of this Dominion long ago, led by mnany
public men, including my honourable friend.
I intend now Vo inquire wbat hope there is
of a solution if we depend upon the report
of this committee, as sponsored by the leader
of this flouse. If one seeks to put that
report in one sentence, what la it? We were
a committee commissioned in-animously by
the Senate Vo find a solution for the "extremely
serious" raiiway problemn of Canada. "Extremely serious"; so described by. this flouse,
and so described with a fidelity to, fact whioh
no mind could possi'bly caîl in question. Such
was our committee's assignment. What is its
report? What solution does it offer? I say Vo
everyone here, defying contradiction, there is

477

no solution offered. The country groaning
under &54,000,000 a year in direct outlay;
$50,000,000 more in respect of interest paid on
advances Vo the road; the country, I say,
groaning under thîs weigbt, and bundreds of
thousands of people standing on our doorsteps
out of work because of the consequent
stricture of enterprise in Canada; and this
commîttee tells us, "We have nothing Vo
suggest but stay just as you are." In effect,
the committee says Vo the taxpayers of Canada,
"Stand and deliver; smile and swallow; grin
and bear it." Sucb is the report which this
flouse is asked Vo commend.
We are told that we have obtained something
out of voluntary co-operation. Yes, last year
we got $1,135,000; precisely that and no more.
And that was the if tb year of co-operation.
If everytbing is granted and complet-ed that
bas been agreed Vo up Vo this hour, we shahl
geV $1,771,000 at the end of six years. At this
rate of progress, Vo reacb even the modest
figure of savings set by Canadian National
o)fficiais wiil take us sixty years.
But that is noV tbe worst. The situation
disclosed by the evidence is that we shaîl
neyer move more than a bair's breadtb further; bardly f ar enougb even Vo caiculate.
Did witnesses bold out any hope? They did
not, last session. They tried bard thîs session,
*but tbey did noV suoceed. I heard no words of
hope. Some reason had Vo, be found then by
-my bunourable frienýd for resurrerting a flicker
of hope for the future. What reason did bie
find? "There is that Canadian Pacifie and its
propaganda for unification. IV did noV want cooperation Vo succeed, so it balked co-operation.
If we wiil just put our foot down on unification, then ail will be fine, the Canadian
Pacifie wiil go abead and co-operate, and we
shal rnake our savings." Faith sublime! Did
we noV put our foot down on unification six
years ago? We did. That was the ultimatum
of Parhiament; that was the declaration of
leaders of both Houses. We went into the
field of co-operation. Did we geV anywhere?
Did the idea of unified management die?
Is it a fact that the Canadian Pacifie balked
co-operation? The report as drafted first by
the leader of the flouse said it was; but when
it was cailed Vo bis attention that there was
flot a sentence, noV a breatb of evidence Vo,
support sncb a contention, the report was
changed. There was no suggestion from
Canadian National wîtnesses that there was
any failure on the part of the Canadian Pacifie.
No more wus there a suggestion from the
Canadian Pacific that there was failure on the
part of the Canadian National.
There were read Vo the committee, out of the
annual report of the Canadian National Rail-

SENATE
way Company for 1934 and 1935, the words
of its president, that failure to proceed farther
than they did was flot the fault of anyone, but
was inherent in the very situation. Stili honourable members will say to this Bouse, "Juat
tell the Canadian Pacifie to stop fiirting with
unification and it will corne back and we
shahl have fine co-operation." Until you can
lix on the Canadian Pacifie responsibility for
delay, yon have no right to make such a
statement-and you have flot fixad it, and you
cannot.
Thus this Bouse is to be led to say, "If we
will only declare that unification is no more,
then the Canadian Pacifie will abandon its
hope"; its allegad resistance will cease-a
rasistance which ail the evidence shows bas

neyer existad.
We are told that the railways could have
enforced co-operation and did flot do so. That
is true. And the reasons are just the samie as
the reasons wby they got nowbere on voluntary
co-oparation. Tbese reasons were agreed to
by every witness. Every tima you nailed bim
down to particulars the witness said, whether
lie wvas fromn one road or from the other: "We
have a different objective from the otber road;
our interests are distinct. We want the problem solved one way because it will best help
our road when yon get beyond the area of
co-operation. We do not want to bear the
big end of tbe hurden; wa do flot want to
get tbe Iight end of the reward. Our interests
are diverse. We are competing, fighting each
other for busineas, therefore we have this
balancing of burden and advantaga, and it
takes us years." Is not tbe answer clear?
Until yon get rid of the diversity of objectives
you will neyer get rid of tbe impediment to
progress.
Let me repeat. The reason was exposed
clearly by witnesses from botb aides as inherent
in tbe very situation, and they did flot hold
out hope that serious progress could be made.
"If we could only keep on," tbey said, "we
think we might get so many million." They
did not ven t ure to mention over ten million;
they never evan expressad the belief that they
would ever get to ten million. But still we are
told that by co-oparation we can hope to solve
the railway problem of Canada.
Now I corne to the more masculine report
presanted so ahly by tbe honourable sanator
from Montarville (Bon. Mr. Beaubien). We
who agrae witb that report felt that we had no
right to bie forgiven if we came to Parliarnent
witbout a recommendation as to the best
means to bie employed to relieve the country
of its burden. In order to find sncb a means,
surely it is not necessary to show that the
whole burden must go, or none. Surely it
iS not nece.ssary to show that the wbole
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGFIE1N.

burden

mnust go, and go quickly;

to show,

as one honourabla senator put it, that there
is some magic remedy wbich can be applied.

There is no magie remedy in this world
of affairs! There is no magie remedy for
anytbing.

For the ilîs we suifer by reason

of our own sins there is no remedy but toil
and strs.igbt thinking. I amn in unison witb
every honourable senator who says that fromn
the wbole burden we have brought upon ourselves we can neyer escape. Possibly, had this
revolution in transportation not corne upon us
-it
bas been coming for fifteen or twenty
years-there mighit have been hope.
Now
thera is no hope. AIl we can do is the best
we can; aIl we cen do is remove every ounce
of the burden that is within our control. The
fact that it cannot alli ha thrown off is the
greater reason for lifting whatever we can,
and starting as soon as we can.
I amn going to inquira for a time whether
the principle advocated by the report embodied
in the amendment cen reasonably be expected
to lead to relief, and if so, how fer and
in wbat length of time. Later I arn going
to inquire wbether in the attainment of
that relief we are paying a, price in enother
way thet subtracts from or cancels the value
of the relief.
On the first point one would not think the
onus should be difficuit to diacharge. I paýss
to the sida for the time baing objections to
so-caliad monopoly. These I will deel with
later.
Leaving thasa asida, it sbould flot be bard
to estahlish that you will get tramendous
savings by unifying two roads in the way of
management. Surely no business man needs
to ha convincad. Be may feal, as a citizen,
that hae does not want monopoly. That remains to ha argued. But the question as to
whetbýer you cen save money doas flot need
to
ha
argued. The honourabla
senator

opposite me (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said
time and tima again that in that way you
will save most, and save it most quickly. I do
flot know why lie signs a report which seys you
will save juat as much in another way. I arn
sure hae doas not think so.
I pause to correct the bonourable senator
from Moncton (Bon. Mr. Robinson). Be
said wa did flot have avidence of savings from
unified management; that wbat wa had was
evidence of savings from unification. In some
way in bis mind this unification is mixad up
with proparty amalgamation. I do not cara
what you call it-unifiad management, unification if you like-it is management by a single
board. Such is unified management. It is not
amalgamation.
Amalgamation bas diffarent
implications altogather. Once you coma to

two systems, then there arises a mutuality of
obligation. It cannot hie avoided. But unified
management invelves no mutual obligations of
that kind at ail; it is merely a system of
managing two as one.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does not the
dictionary define themn in the samne way?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Fortunately,
for simple words I do flot need a dictionary.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is a very
smart. answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the right
answer.
Hon. Mr. MURDOÇK: The dictionary
describes themn as the same thing.*
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Cali it what
you like, it is unified management we
recommtend; and I know what it is, and se
does the honourable senator from Parkdale.
It is not amalgamation of properties.
The reason one starts from a position of
advantage in showing that savings flow from
unified management is that it has been a
matter of experience ail through the history of
business that when yeu have unified management you can immedîately get rid of duplicate
services. While you have cempetition it is
the hardest thing in the world te do se, Ïbecause
those duplicate services are the very services
that compete. Until we get rid of duplicate
services, unnecessary services~
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then unification
begins.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member wants to get me away from my
point. I am coming te his bogeys in a
few minutes. I do not take these fears cf the
honourable gentleman very seriously; they
were born tee recently. In the past, and best
years of bis manhood he neyer had them at
ail; they are the outgrowth of certain political
nightmares of the last few months.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg your
pardon.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net take
them, seriously.
You can have unification of control and
operation without amalgamation. I stand here
and say this. I have neyer seen an instance of
unification of management, or, for that matter,
of lamalgamation of two great enterprises
fighting each other in the samne field, where
tremendous savings were not made. It can be
abjected to on other grounds; for instance,
it can conceivably be objected te on pu!blic
grounds; but to say that it will flot save
money is simply te deny the dictates of
cemmon sense.

479

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Nobody says
that.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f course flot.
And until xny honoursble friend brought in
his report nobody ever suggested that as
much money could be saved in any oCher way
as by unification. Only through that singlenesa of objective which cemes fromn a common
purse can the utmost savings or any worthwhile savings be realized.
It was contended by Canadian Pacific
witnesses that aggregate ecenomies of
$75,300,000 were possible under unification if
business returned te the scale of 1930, which
they thought was an average year. I do not
agree with them, for I think 1930 can be
regarded as far aba an average year, speaking as from the present time. But I cannot
agree with the statement that they failed to
substantiate their estianate of econemies. In
fact, I do not regard arguments of Canadian
National officiaIs as meeting the case in any
way. The mnethods ado-pted by Canadian
Pacific witnesses were certaînly thorough and
impressive. Thare were twenty-one committees dealing with every phase of railway
eperations ever a space of months, checking
and rechecking oe against another. These
committeas, composed of officiaIs of higli
standing, conducted their studies in a serious
way, carrying eut the suggestions made by a
commission with whose objects they had the
utmost sympathy. And the figures arrived at
by these committees are lightly dascribed to us
by seme honourable members as "theoretical."
I should like to ask what is meant by
"theoretical " savings. It is an easy thing to
trip an adjective off the tongua, but is it
suggested that railway officials of the type cf
Mr. Neal, and of various other gentlemen
who came before *us, were putting something
purely imýaginary ýbafore the Duif Commiasion
and befere ourselves? What in the world
would they have te gain by that? Were they
net able te support their estimates before us?
I do net ýknow of any important irnpairment
cf their tastimony.
I know cf general attacks upen it fromn
different angles, and I will deal with them in a
moment. Those economies were made up of a
vast array of elements; savîngs in, the amalgamation cf head offices, savings in reducing
supervisorships fromn two te oe ever the whele
range cf railway operation, savings in maintenance cf way and structuras--those savings

tion, where the advantages of shortest and
cheapest routes come into play, advantages
which cannot be obtained except under a
system of unified management. There were
also savings in respect of delivery of empty
cars. We were given a picture of empty cars
running east on the lines of one road, while
another stream of empties ran west on the
other road. This would be avoided under
unification. And there would be savings in
the redelivery of empties to American roads,
in consolidation of trains, by having cars
fully loaded instead of half loaded. All these
things are made possible only if the two
systems are operated under joint direction.
Further savings in seven figures were estimated
from unified management of express and
telegraph offices.
Estimates were presented under these various
headings, and there was no difficulty in understanding them. That vast savings would result
from unification was made abundantly clear.
How were these estimates attacked? First,
it was said that a lot of reductions in expenses
had been made already. Canadian National
witnesses-chiefly Mr. Fairweather-said, " Our
expenses are $47,000,000 lower than they were
in 1930, and this reduction cannot be made
over again." In that statement those witnesses
persisted, unless one cornered them pretty
closely. But the fact finally emerged that
savings made by a single road are entirely or
almost entirely distinct from savings possible
under unified management. For instance, there
can be no avoidance of duplication by a single
road. It was shown that out of the $47,000,000
only about $4,000,000 was included in the
estimated savings under unification. And while
it was admitted that the estimated savings
should be reduced by that $4,000,000, it was
also established that there was an additional
$9.000,000 of practicable savings which had
been omitted from figures submitted to the
Duff Commission; so the original estimates to
that commission were left intact and unimpaired.
A second ground for attack upon the estimates was that the unit costs of the Canadian
Pacific Railway would not apply to Canadian National operations. In this new document which was handed to my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and
which he presented to the House, Canadian
National officials lightly toss aside $20,000,000 of estimated savings as due to wrong
application of unit costs. May I discuss that
for a moment? One of the main methods
employed hy Canadian Pacifie officials and
accountants was this. They took the costs of
a unit of railway operation in respect of,
say, express trains, or freight, or car repairs,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

or locomotive maintenance, or right-of-way
maintenance, and applied that over the united
system, and, comparing their total with existing totals under separate management, thereby
showed that savings could be made in respect
of those various items. Canadian National
officials say, "It is not fair to apply Canadian
Pacifie unit costs to the Canadian National,
because our density of traffie is less, our conditions are different." The Canadian Pacifie
made an answer, to which the Canadian
National obdurately refused to refer. That
answer was this: "We are not applying our
unit costs to your road. We are not impugning the efficiency of your management"and they never did, though they made no
admissions that it was as good as theirs-"we
are only seeking to apply our unit costs to
a new system composed of both roads."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Canadian National.

But covering

Certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
But that is far different from saying that the
Canadian Pacifie could apply their unit costs
to the operation of the Canadian National as
a separate system.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And they could
not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They never
said they could. All they did was to apply
their unit costs to the combined system. If
the Canadian National had the same density
of traffie as the Canadian Pacifie, and there
were an equality of other conditions on both
roads, then unification would result in lower
unit costs over the combined system than those
now applicable to the Canadian Pacifie alone.
That is only reasonable, because the more business you handle the lower your unit costs must
be. But the Canadian Pacifie said: "Admitting that you have a more expensive road to
operate than ours is, we feel that reductions
in expense consequent upon unification would
result in unit costs for the combined system
as low as those at present applicable to our
own separate road." I ask honourable members if that is not reasonable. Is there anything in the way of a boast there? At least
the reasoning was never afterwards attacked.
Yet my honourable friend asks the House to
deduct $20,000,000 from estimated savings
because Canadian Pacifie unit costs are not
applicable to the Canadian National.
It is true that in certain minor particulars
the Canadian Pacific's estimate was found to
be erroneous. In the aggregate those errors
were small. They were atoned for by other
economies shown to be practicable, though
their exact figures could not be calculated.

MAY 25, 1939
Ail these tbings only went to establish what
should have heen obvious from the beginning,
that savings of the largest conceivable order,
larger far than by any other means, could be
made by union of management of the two
systems.
Now the leader of the House says, "Well,
we are going to get these by co-oparation." I
have discussed the prospects. I do flot think
that even in bis own mind hie believes they are
real-though I do flot like s0 to allege. 1
cannot sae how anybody could sit through
the meetings of our committee and seriously
expect rasuits. But suppose we do. Let us
concade for a moment that nearly all of these
economies wa shall get by co-operation. Let us
reason along that line and find out what
is the consequence.
I digress for a moment. Be it ramembered
that an adroit politician, this samne gentleman,
Mr. Fairwaather-whatever hae is as a railway
man I do flot know-laid befora Sir Henry
Thornton in 1931, and subsequantly 'before the
Duif Commission, astimatas of savings of
$59,000,000, on the basis of 1930 traffic as
resulting fromn unified management. It is true
hie added a rider. 1 do not know whan hie
added it, but I have a suspicion that it was
pretty late.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ahl 1 know is
that it is in exhibits of the Duif Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yen.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f ail the
senselass things I ever read this rider is the
worst. Ha gave an estimata of $59,000,000
of savings and then added a rider saying you
could not get those savings. It reminds me
of a report made years ago, during the South
African war. Thare was a long, cireumstantial
account fromn a distînguished soldiar »of the
capture of 200 Boers by the exercise. of
outstanding bravery, and then there was a
postscript saying, "The Boers escaped." 0f
just the saine quality is this testimony of
Mr. Fairweather's. "Oh," hie said, "I did
estimata for the Duif Commission savings
of $59,740,000. I made it up dollar by dollar.
I went to terrifie trouble. I had eight technical
assistants and thirty clerks and we worked at
it day and night for months. We had access
to the Canadian Pacifie Railway and the
benefit of ahl thair organization. We did it on
the instruction, of the chief of our road for the
Duif Commission, and we showed datail by
datail, $59,740,000. But really we could not
save that sum. It was ahl 'theoretical,' it w as
aIl in my imagination, and I put a rider to my
report saying that while thase figures are an
estimate of savings, they are savings we cati-

481

flot make at ail." Such is Mr. Fairweather.
I think that "theoretical" idea was an afterthought whicIl occurred when the plans of
himself and Sir Henry Thornton had changad.
I will tell you something more. The
samne Mr. Fairweather before the saine commission estimated 835,000,000 as savings from
co-operation. And hae dîd not attach any
qualifications to that estimate. He did flot
put in a rider saying, "Those figures are
'theoratical'; they are savings that might be
made if you had a docile public and a servile
staff." He did not say anything of the kind.
They were definite savinga which hie estimýated
as capable of being achieved 'by co-oparation.
Dbes anybody question my assertion that
they were given to that commission without
qualification? 1 want te know on what evidcnce the Duif Commission reported ini
favour of co-operation. They reported in
favour of it, I think, mainly on Mr. Fair-.
weather's evidence. If they did net, I do flot
know on what they basad their report. There
hie stood cemmittad te that $35,000,000.
Where dees hie stand to-day? Bafore our
committea hie whittlad bis figure down te
810,000,000, and then hie did not express any
baliaf that wa could get it. He told us it was
only a guess. And this is the evidence upon
which the honouraible leader of this House
hangs bis report te Parliament! To the Duif
Commission Mr. Fairweather gave a definite,
unqualifiad astimate of 835,000,000 basad on
bis good faith and bis reputation; te our
committee hae astimates 810,000,000, and then
hae tells us it is only a guess.
Now-to revert-we will suppose that you
really can achieve 83W,000,000, or whatever
you want to make it, hiy co-operatien. Think
a moment! What are these objections te
unified management? We are tohd that men
will be thrown out of work. "They wiIl lose
their joJbs," says the sanator from. Moncton.
Fawar supplies will 'ha bought, and therefore
thara will be less sales tax. There will be
disturbance by closing a station in soea tewn
and using anothar oe hundred feet away.
Ahi these terrible calamitias will baf ail our
country. "Therefore," daclaras the senator
fromn Sackville and the sanater fromn Montreal,
"let us get thasa things dona by co-oparation."
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The sanator from, Sackville is Hon. Mr. Coipp. He in net hare.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let me inquire
of the sanator from. Montreal, whe is hare.
If this saine thing is dona by co-operation will
not the men lose their jobs? Will thare net

Let us proceed along that line. Get your
$10,000,000 or $15,000,000 or S20,000 ,000, and
what have you done? Just as far as you go,
every man is out of work who would have
,been out of work if you had done so by unified
management. Every reduction in purchase is
made, every line is abandoned, under co-operation as under unification. Ail these things
which have 'been pictnrod as terrible calamities

Just think of the position we are in! Go

of ce-operation that you can go under nnified

thonsands of mon employed on pool trains,
in unified express and telegraph offices and the
like, haîf of themn under the charge of one
set of head office men, and the other haîf
under another set, and both doing the very
same work. Cam yon think of a monstrosity
like that? Can you picture such a hydraheaded monster in the realm of business?
One long body and two heads! It is beyond
conception. So I say, if for a moment you
hope to got wortb-while resuits fromn co-oeration; much more, if you hope, as your
report says, to go the length you would

'brought upon the country everything that you

ail disasters that you in yonr imagination have

There is the bugbear of abandomment of
uines. It is hard to order one's thoughts
consecutively and make at the same time a
reply to speeches immediately precedimg. Certainly my attempt is imperfect. Abandomment
comes under the same general argument as
everything else, but, to listen to honourable
senators who wamt to get a vote against
unified management and the saving of money,
une would think that the whoie probiem
revolved aroumd abandonment of lines. The
homonrable leader of the Honse said, and I
was surprised to hear him, that if we did not
abandon linos we had to take $16,000,000 off
the Canadian Pacific estimate of saving-s.
That is not true. The $16i.000,000 includes
far more than mere savings from abandonment.
Without abandonment at ail you make
substantial economios by directing the great
bulk of traffic over anothor uine, leaving
oniy perhaps local traffie, and therefore you
have a reduced standard of maintenance. Only
$7,240,000 of that $75,300l,000 is attributable
to abandonment of limes. You could get ail

homonrable members wouid like to think.
They talk of these pioncer roads hoing tomn up.
No une suggests such a thing. We must keep
ur pioneer roads in uporation on the Camadian
Pacifie as well as the Camadian National.
Maybe they show a loss on the books, but
they feed the main linos. Those piomeer roads
are needed by the mon who have settled alomg
thom. But if you do net du something to
bring rationalized business methods into unr
railways yen will have to close down those very
limes. What is proposed by umified management is net the abandonment of pioner linos
that serve the farmer, the miner and the
fisherman, but the abandomment of duplicato
linos, linos which double over each other and
are stili continued because they belong to
competing concerns. The lcader of the Ilouse
says the Caniadian National is making money

that both are making money, but they are each

You no more need both of those five-hundredmile lines than a coach needs a fifth wheel.
If you are nat ready ta make that saving,
if you keep on throwing money away and
doing no good to anybody, then you are going
ta have to abandon uines you really do need.

bc able ta operate essential services, and
not just foolishýly squander because it is easy.
If we sa persist we shahl bring ourselves into a

my honourable friend says are so vital.

I do nat speak these words with any pride.
I neyer had cansummate faith in government
aperatian. I was convinced years aga, and
rightly, that we had came ta a time when,
as mortgagees af many roads in distress, we
had ta take them over and try aur hand.
We bad na other course open ta us. I must
not be drawn inta a long discussion af aur
reasons. We were martgagees and creditors,
or we had guaranteed their bonds. We might
have wiped these securities out by a receivership, but if we did sa we wiped out aurselves.
I have seen government operation in seve.ral
spheres, and my convictions have been reinforced. There are often advantages af unification under gavernxnent aperation. Thiey
have these ini the Hydro Electric System of
Ontario. But do not let anyone think the
benefits af that great system are due ta goverilment operation. They are not. Much duplication of services and waste are avoided because
it is a united system-that and nothing else.
I have had enough of goverument, operation.
My honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon.
7149"-11

483

Mr. McRae) says hie has not given up bis
faith. He says the Government can find men
capable af managing a business of this magnitude in an efficient manner. I ask the honourable senator if hie thinks aur business is
operated that way now.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: No.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, and the
honourable gentleman does nat need ta look
very far back ta be sure it bas flot been
operated in that way. Hie says, "Put these
men in where they cannot be interfered with."
I would remind him that even Sa, aIl you have
ta do is ta pass a new Act and repeal the aId
one, and they are gone. Do not tell me you
can operate a railway witb ministers ai the
Crown directing its policies from 'by-election
platforms. Do nat tell any business man that.
Do mat tell us that a directorate is running the
Canadian National Railways. It is not. "Vote
for aur candidate," say cabinet ministers fram
the hustings in Montreal, "and we will climb
into that hale on Dorchester street and rear
upon it a palace." Eleven momths afterwards
thse directors ai the Canadian National meet
together and say ta themselves, "We will
answer aur master's voice," and dutifully
they pass a resolution. Business operatian
of railways! Says a minister oi the Crown:
"Do mot bother about the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act calling for ca-operative
terminals, pool trains and the like; do naot
bother your heads about those things. We need
ta win this election. Vote us into power and we
will borrow millions on public credit and out
af hales we will make stations, no matter
what that Act may say."
Do not talk ta me af business aperation.
I could point right at this hour ta some
things which would very quickly erase such
a conception fromn one's mmnd. Wipe away,
as we have dame, ail the capital contributed
in any way except as investment for the purpose of interest; do aIl that: it is already done.
Last year they did not even earn taxes or rent
of equipment, though aur leader's repart says
they did. His repart says that aIl they went
bebimd was the amaunt of interest on maney
invested iby the public. That is nat sa.
Outside af that altagether, they went behind
in seven figures. In addition they earmed nat
a cent af interest on money put in by the
public for railway ýpurpases. Do you tell me
a raad wbich cannot earn a nickel upon that
basis in the year 1938 is a well managed road?
I should not care if the Canadian Pacifie had
said nathing. There is other evidence emough
ta show the Canadian National cannot now
be run ini the way in which it must be
run if the country is ta be saved fromn
bamkruptcy. We are on the downhill alide.

National Bill was before us the honourabla
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was flot
afraid of the disappearance of competition.
Is there any competition in a real sense now?
What have we to fear? Service has to
ha up to Transportation Commission requirements; fares must bc dirtated by themn; evary
form of service to the peoplc-railway stations,
trains, everything else-is under the supervision of the nation through its commission.
Who should be afraid of monopoly? Monopoly in transportation? We know that vast
areas of the country neyer have had anything
but monopoly, and they have flot suffered at
ail. People there geV just as good service as
people wlio are situated in the midst of
duplication.
But is there not competition enough? New
comnpetition bas arisen; old competition bas
been reinforced. New competition has arrived
in the form of buses and trucks and motor
cars-a keener competition than that of any
rival railway. Neyer fear we are going to lack

competition is more severe than ever bafore.
The leader of the Government tells us that

than in 1937, when we bad a population of
eleven million. Though our population had
gone up by two millions, the business of the
railways had gona down 26 par cent. If he will
consult, the fiures of 1938 ha will find the
population had gone up since 1923 a great
dJeal over two millions. and the business of
the railways had gone down 30 per cent.
Passenger business had gone down by at least
50 par cent. Now, if an increase of population

of over two millions means a 30 par cent
reduction in business, bow doas ha reason
that an incrase of four millions in population
will mean a 40 par cent increase in business?

Lastly, ha says ha is afraid now of unified

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We should bave
allowed them Vo go into receivership.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the interruption bas any pertinence, the honourable
gentleman can leV the Canadian Pacifia go
into receivership, and no.t take ovar that
compan ' . If it would hava heen prudent to
permit receivership in the case of other railroads, whare we wera guarantors and stood
to ]ose hy their liquidation, surely it would
not ha nccssary in the case of the Canadian
Pacifie, whbare w are not guiarantors. So wliat
is my honourable friand afraid of?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANTD: The Canadian
Pacific is not in a bankrupt position to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f course it
is not. My honourabla friand is not afraid of
its hankruptcy. Then, why doas ha fear that
we should have Vo take over the Canadian
Pacifie? We have neyer taken over a road
unless it had hecome baukrupt.
Hon. Mr. DANTYURAiND: Doas my right
honouraibla friand want amalgamation under
state ownership?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 0f course I
do not. But I fear that may happen unless
we do something sensible. I arn net going
to prediat that the Canadian Pacifia will go
downbill unless wa do something, but I ask
honourable members seriously te pause and
raflect. In the past some things have happened
which we did not axpeat would bappan. I
know the Canadian Pacifia is a well managed
road, that its namie is almost syflonymlous
throughout the world with the namne of
Canada, and that it has heen the major
contributor to our country's greatness. But
in this world of men nothing is so wel

managed -that if it is compelled to operate on
a wholly unsound basis it will be ini no
danger of insolvency. If my honourable, friend
wants to avoid the calamity of government
ownership and operation of the Canadian
Pacifie, the way to do it is to avoid the danger
of bankruptcy. Just acquiesce in the continuance of policies whieh mean unnecessary
waste to the Canadian Pacifie, to the Canadian
National and the whole country, and you
help to push not only the nation, but ite
greatest property, the Canadian Pacifie, along
the road to destruction. That danger can. be
avoided 'by taking sound courses, which reduce
costs without curtailing services. Get rid of
duplication, eut out the wastage, of tens and
scores of millions, and you will avoid the
approach of insolvency and the peril of
government ownership.
We ail know there are economie laws whicb
no man or group of men and no country has
ever successfully defied. We may impade
their operation, if wa are foolish enough, but
we'shall have to pay the price; we may
ignore them, if wa are stupid enough, but
thay will sooner or later grind us to powder.
It may be important for some to watch and to
saek acclaim by echoing the rnoods of the
populace, and to forge thair opinions in the
light of what they think the people like. But
sure]y that is not the duty of the Sanate of
Canada!1 Surely if we have one function it is
to point the way and try to advanca public
thinking toward settlement of business problems
on business lines. What wa have in front of
us is nothing but a business problam. If the
Senata of Canada is to disregard its dutyand I say wîth reluctance that this session we
have made in that respect a more sorry
performance than I have ever seen beforethen let us retire from these seats of emolument and dignity, and let us go back among
the masses of our people, whom wa are always
raady to Ioad with burdens, and always aager
to flatter and cheer, but whom wa fail ta serve.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourabla senators, I would move adjournment of the

Considerable ground has bean coverad by

amalgamation and tha monopoly of state
ownership of railways. If my right honourabla friand is sincera-and I do flot doubt that
ha is--in affirming opposition to state ownership and railway monopoly, I would tell him
that unifiad mpnagamant, which ha favours,
would inevitably lead to unification, and ultimately to amalgamation. If thare had to ba
amalgamation, my right honourable friand
would prafer that it ba undar privata control
rather than under the State, but I think I am
right in saying that the country at large
would not agrea with him. It is safa to say
that the public are not at prasant disposad,
nor will thay ba disposad in the near future,
to confida control ovar 42,000 miles of railway, nearly $300,000,000 of annual axpenditure, and 150,000 men-who would reprasant
probably 150,000 families-to a smaîl group of
citizens, howaver select.
I hava had axperianca in observing the
administration of large railway systams, and
I know soma-thing of whiat thair influence in
the country is. I fret it to-day in the propaganda which is baing carried on in Canada
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie by one of
our railways, the Canadian Pacifie.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Control over

My right honourable friend urges that if
we want to save the country and the Canachan Pacifie Railway from disastar, wa should
put both railway systems undar unifiad management and th-us raduce administration costs.
The Bennett Government cama into, power
in' 1930 with the slogan "Competition evar,
amalgamation neyer." To that slogan the
people had raspondedRight Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN:

"Amen."

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -affirmatively.
Then the Bennett Government appointed the
Duff Commission, which recommended that
competition between the two railways should
be as far as possible eliminated, but that
there should not be amalgamation. 'In its
report the commission suggested the pooling
of trains, the placing under one management
of telegraph companies and, likewise, of express
companies, and se on, which suggestions I
referred to in my speech yesterday.
The Canadian National-Canadian Pacific
Act of 1932-1933 was based upon that report.
Now I look at the mandate which was given
both railways by that Act, and I ask why they
have not co-operated as we expected them
to do. Between 1933 and 1935 the Bennett
Government were able to supervise the operation of that Act. They did very little to
set up the organization provided for in the
Act. Be that as it may, my right honourable
friend has been repeating the statement of
my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) that for six long years nothing
bas been done. Something has been done, but
the railways went about it very slowly. IL
is only during the last few months that our
committee found they had agreed to the
principle of pooling all competitive passenger
trains from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This
is a decided step forward.
It may be asked why they have not agreed
to go faster towards executing the mandate
imposed upon them by the Act of 1933. They
were directed to work together in harmony
and try to eliminate competition as far as
possible in order to bring about savings. But
while they were trying to co-operate, the
President of the Canadian Pacific was going
from one end of the country to the other
declaring that the only solution for the railway problem was unification. My right honourable friend says, "You have no evidence
that there was any dilatoriness on the part
of the Canadian Pacific with respect to cooperation." Well, President Hungerford last
year, and again this year, said that if there
was earnest co-operation on the part of the
railways, and the campaign for unification was
discontinued, there could be results.
My right honourable friend says there is
danger that conditions may become worse and
that the Canadian Pacific may face dire consequences.
I put this question to my right
honourable friend: Is it not the first and most
imperative duty of the board of directors of
the Canadian Pacifie to attend to their own
salvation? If it is, and they are told that the
country does not accept unification or amalgamation, and they must work out their own
salvation under the Act of 1933, I submit that
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

on the basis of what has already been done
under co-operation the Canadian Pacifie can
improve its situation considerably. I admit
it is much easier to obtain results under
unified management, amalgamation or monopoly, because in that case there is but one
administration. However, as the country is
not ready to-day to hand the two railways
over to private management, as the trend is
all the other way, I repeat, let the board of
directors of the Canadian Pacifie work out
their own salvation under the 1933 Act.
There may be need of compulsion on the
part of the Government, and, if so, I think
the statutory powers should be invoked. Undoubtedly line abandonments can be brought
about under co-operation, but in many instances efforts to that end have been blocked
by the Board of Railway Commissioners, now
the Transport Board. Substantial economies
can be effected by the reduction of car and
train miles and by the consolidating of
stations, yards, terminals, locomotive and car
shops and various activities. All this can be
done under the Act of 1933. The sole reason
for the dilatoriness is that there was not the
will to co-operate. I will not place upon
the Canadian Pacifie responsibility for this
tardiness, except to say that Sir Edward Beatty
did not believe in co-operation and continued
to offer the publie his own nostrum of unification. In these cireunmstances it is easy to
realize the atmosphere created in the administration of the two railways.
To-day Sir Edward Beatty again cornes
before the Senate with the hope that we shall
give some impetus to his movement for unification. I feel the Senate should hesitate to
do so, for I am confident it would only lead
us into a blind alley. If the Canadian Pacifie
can get a majority of honourable members
to declare that Sir Edward's nostrum is the
best solution, then he will continue his campaign and will not utilize the Act of 1933 as
it should be utilized. I am quite sure, however, that if the Canadian Pacifie will turn
towards co-operation under the Act of 1933,
considerable savings can be effected.
My right honourable friends suggests that
all the ills which would flow from unification
as set out in my report would also flow from
co-operation. There is not a word about this
in the report.
Of course

willingness to accept the consequences of cooperation. I repeat, the things which the Actý
of 1933 indicates as being desîrable to be
clone by the two railways, and which 1 enumeratcd ycsterday, would enable them to bring
about considerable savings. It is the duty of
the Canadian National to lead the way in this
direction and request appointment of arbitral
courts. My right honourable friend asks what
co-operation under the Act of 1933 has produccd. I admit tbe procedure was slow and
that it bas not produced very much, but i
this connection I find in the report contained
in tbe amendment which the honourable
gentleman from Montarville moved yesterday
this paragraph:
That such unified operations as have in a
very minor way been put in effect in respect
of our railways have already shown large percentage reductions. In the case, for example,
of the pool trains, there has been shown an
operating saving of 33 per cent, though such
pool trains still carry the waste Qf duplication
in terminais, yards, etc.
What is the conclusion to be drawn from
that paragraph of the report signed by my
right honourable friend? Surely that this
is a very good example of what is possible
under co-operation when there is a willingness to co-operate earnestly. Why should
the two railways not continue to obtain greater
results by enlarging that programme of cooperation? 1 arn not surprised to find that as
a consequence of the results obtained under
this experimental pooling the two railways
have corne to the conclusion that they should
pool ail their competitive passenger trains;
and this conclusion is ail the morp natural
when, as we know, their passenger trains
are mostly in the red. Other savings can be
effected ail along the line. For instance, they
can obtain running rights and similar co-operation in many fields.
I think the Canadian Pacifie will resign
itself to further co-operation. The Canadian
National, as I have said, is under the wing
of the Canadian people, and the Canadian
Pacifie is desirous of forming a partnership
which wilI bring it under the financial umbrella
of the Dominion Government. The Act
passed by the Bennett Government indicates
what course should be taken if the Canadian
Pacifie fails in its attempt to bring about
unified management. In these circumstances
I wonder if we are not doing the wise thing

487

hy telling the two railways, "You have not
done what should have been done under the
Act of 1933." As a matter of fact they failed
to utilize that Act. No one could say which,
the Canadian National or the Canadian Pacifie, had blocked the way and was responsible
for the smallness of the resuit. We have ail
been disappointed. The country at large has
been disappointed'. I hold the Canadian
Pacifie responsible by reason of the fact that
it carried on a campaign of propaganda to
show that co-operation was a failure. Otherwise how could Sir Edward Beatty carry on
bis propaganda? 1 think this is very logical.
My right honourable friend took upon himself the responsibility of saying that the Canadian National was not administered as it
should be; that it was a state-owned railway and under the influence of the Government and of ministers. The only evidence
he brings forward to esta'blish his affirmation
is bis statement with regard to the Montreal
terminal, which was started in 1929, suspended in 1931, and, started again a few cnonths
ago. An effort was macle to bring the Canadian Pacifie into the picture, and 1 must admit
that I said I would not allow the Canadian
Pacifie to intervene in this domestie matter
of the Canadian National. I did not say that
the committee could flot examine witnesses
and go into the question of the terminal or
the adàvisability of continuing its development. I said it was a matter for the committee, flot a matter for the Canadian Pacifie
Railway.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We could not
hear from the Canadian Pacific; we could
on.ly hear the oCher side: that is what you
saidi.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I denied to the
Canadian Pacifie the right to say what forai
the Canadian National terminal in Montreal
should take.
Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You would
not let them give evidence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Certainly I
would not. My honourable friend said we
should bear the other side. I said, "What
other side?" and my right honourable friend
did not anewer.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The aide that wanted
to co-operate.
Riglit Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.

488

SENATE

That matter was finally decided after examination by the Railway Board, and was closed.
Money had been expended towards giving the
Canadian National a decent station in Montreal, and the city was highly interested in
having that station.
I said in the committee that I had been
wondering why the Canadian Pacifie Railway
was so intent upon preventing the Canadian
National from having a decent station in
Montreal.
I saw in my mind's eye that
splendid mass of masonry at Windsor and
Osborne, and the unspeakable building of the
Canadian National called the Bonaventure
station. I wondered what object the Canadian
Pacifie could have in trying to prevent the
Canadian National-a system larger than the
Canadian Pacifie, and carrying a greater
tonnage and more passengers-from having a
better station than it had. Of course the two
railways have in the city of Montreal organs
which are most devoted to them-the Montreal
Gazette and the Montreal Star. Here is what
I found on the editorial page of the Montreal
Star in justification of the Canadian Pacifie
intervention in the question of the terminal.
It explained to me the whole attitude of the
Canadian Pacifie. Referring to the development of the terminal at the tunnel, which has
been in operation for years, it said:
It is bound to be a body blow to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, which will be faced with
the unfair competition of a new, a modern and
lavishly equipped station, at the disposal of its
rival only, but paid for by the taxpayers of
Canada, including the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
Of course that is quite in accordance with
human nature. It is natural that the Canadian
Pacifie should wish the Windsor station could
be utilized.
But, that plan having been
absolutely discarded in 1929 by the report of
Sir Frederick Palmer, the matter could surely
not be reopened in a committee of the Senate
in 1939. That is why I said I was prepared
to have the Canadian National officials examined as to why they had decided to start
developing their terminal in 1938-39, but I
was not ready to allow the Canadian Pacifie
Railway to intervene, or, as the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
has said, to " poke its nose " into the private
affairs of the Canadian National. A vote was
taken, and it was decided that we should not
reopen that question, which had been definitely
settled in 1929.
I shall not traverse the whole ground covered
by my right honourable friend, but shall
content myself with referring to the essential
difference between those members of the
committee who were of his opinion and those
who agreed with the report. To the majority
of the committee united management was

tantamount to amalgamation-to a monopoly
in private hands. We were not ready to
accept that principle, and said there should
be a fair trial of co-operation, a method
which bas not been followed since 1033 or 1934.
A fair trial would mean earnest co-operation
between the two railways in order that under
the Act they might do the best they couldwhich is considerable. I included the Act
itself in my remarks of yesterday. As was
said by my honourable friend from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan), the people of Canada
will not be satisfied that the two railways
have done their duty to the country until
they have honestly and earnestly tried the
co-operative principle which is embodied in
the law of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I am sure no
one would object to what the honourable
gentleman calls a respectable station, but I
understand that some $12,000,000 is to be
spent upon it. I believe the very building
in which we are now sitting did not cost
more than $15,000,000, and I would ask why
such a huge sum as bas been mentioned
should be spent upon a railway station.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A terminal
station must be built for t he Canadian
National Railways. It is a necessity. Construction was suspended for a few years, but
the board of directors of the Canadian National
got the Government to consent to contribute
40 per cent of the expenditure by way of relief
in order that men who were idle might be
employed. With this contribution the Canadian National feels that the proper thing to
do is to proceed with the work. The programme covers three years. I may say that
when that board was elected every member
of the Senate admitted it was a strong board;
and those who supported the views of the
Canadian Pacifie were very much elated
when they heard that Mr. Murdock had
resigned from the board. They immediately
jumped to the conclusion that he was opposed
to the expenditure of this money on the Montreal terminal.
The correspondence between
Mr. Murdoch and the Minister of Transport,
which was published and was deposited, I
think, on the tables of both Houses, showed
that Mr. Murdoch resigned because he felt
that President Hungerford was not sufficiently
serious in his defence of the actions of the
board of directors, more especially in regard
to continuing the work on the Montreal
terminal. I may repeat what I said in committee.
It so happens that the work was
decided upon on the motion of Mr. James
Y. Murdoch, a member of the board.

MAY 25, 1M3
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is flot an
answer to my question. I do flot see why a
palace should be buit. 1 cannot understand
why $12,000,000 should be spent on a railway
station.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
question of spending a large sum of money
on a big building like the Windsor station.
It is simply a question of having a station to
be used by the trains coming from the east,
the north and the south. It is a restricted
programme, flot the one which was decided
upon in 1929.
Hlon. Mr. MTJRDOCK: I understand that
the larger part of the expenditure of $12,000,000
is for the purpose of building overhead construction, from the end of the Victoria bridge
and from St. Henry, in order to bring traffie
into the new station. lb is not for the actual
building of the station.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It includes the whole
terminal.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: lb includes the
whole thing. But ýmy understanding is that
the greater part of the money will be spent
on things other than the station itsel-f.

RAIL WAY PROBLEM

REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I move that His Honour the Speaker
be asked to disregard the first five items on
the Order Paper for the time being and call
item No. 6, for resumption of the debate on
the railway question.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the report of the Special Committee appointed on March 30, 1938, to inquire
into and report upon the best means of relieving the country of its extremely serious railway condition and financial burden consequent
thereto.
Honourwble
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, having fully in mind the several
very important speeches that have already
been made in respect of Canada's particular
railway problem, I feel somewhat humble
and, shall I say, out of place in undertaking
to compete with some of the distinguished
gentlemen who have preceded me in the
debate. A number of very able lawyers have
presented their points of view on this problem, both in the present debate and formerly.
I arn not a lawyer, but, if the House will
pardon a personal reference, I may say that
on the lSth day of April next it will be fifty
years since I first became a Canadian Pacific
railway employee.'
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

For the first
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
twelve years of that period I was a freigbt
brakeman, and I was working in that capacity
for six years before I saw an air brake on a box
car. We used to stop trains by a hand brake
operated from the top. For a few years I
was a conductor, and then, in 1905, 1 was
elected as a representative of railroad men.
In that capacity durîng the years that followed I was in conference in most of the
important railroad offices in the United States
and Canada. This experience is my only excuse
for believing that I ought to know something
about railway problems.

SENATE

In 1938 the Senate appointed a special
committee to consider our very serious railway situation. The committee held twentythree sittings that session.
Early in the
present session the committee was re-appointed,
and it has held fourteen sittings since. When
our committee commenced its sittings in 1938,
and especially at the beginning of its sittings
this session, my possibly biased judgment was
that certain distinguished members of the
committee were ready to make a report as
to what should be done. I admit that I
may have been absolutely mistaken in thinking that some men's minds were already made
up, but, as I say, I had that firm conviction
from the commencement of our hearings in
1938, and I held it more strongly at the
commencement of the committee's meetings
this year.
At the committee's sittings in these two
sessions we heard from various prominent
railroad individuals and others. This year we
had before us a number of, shall I say, specially
picked individuîals to give the committee
certain information. Incidentally, the terms
"unification" and "amalgamation" were used
frequently at the committee's sittings, and
last evening when my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was speaking I
appealed to him to indicate the difference
in meaning between the tiwo terms. He was
too busy to let me have the information, which
I know he could have given off-hand, and so
I went for guidance to Funk and Wagnall's
New Standard Dictionary of the English
Language, where I find these definitions:
Amalgamate-Unite, combine, coalesce, as two
parts in growth.
Amalgamation-To form a homogeneous whole
or a new body.
Unify-To cause to be a unit or one; reduce
to uniformity, unite; view or regard as one.
Unification-The act of unifying or the state
of being unified; consolidated.
With my sparse education I am unable even
to imagine very much difference between the
terms "unification" and "amalgamation." Possibly some other gentleman who is gnore
familiar with English dictionary terms can
give me additional enlightenment on that
subject later. I was really hoping that my
right honourable friend would give me the
information last night, but, as I say, he was
too busy.
A moment ago I said that this year several
special-if I may use the term-hand-picked
individuals appeared before the committee.
One of them was a very capable professor
from Queen's University, who gave the committee voluminous information. As a parttime railroad man I thought some of his facts
and reasonings were entirely unacceptable from
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

the standpoint of railroad practice, but I am
quite sure that many members of the committee regarded his evidence as sound and
correct. In order to indicate the extent of
his knowledge and experience, may I cite this
passage from his evidence as reported at
page 22 of the committee's proceedings:
Secondly, even the engineer, who is the most
skilled member of the train crew, need not
be a person of an unusual skill. A man of
sound intelligence could be trained to operate
a locomotive in a very short time. In the prewar period, when the labour force was being
rapidly increased, men quite frequently ran as
full-fledged engineers after only six months'
experience.
At the time that appeared to me to be absolute nonsense. I wonder if any honourable
senator and bis family would like to start out
on the tail-end of a twelve or fourteen car
passenger train, representing a million dollars
of equipment, with Professor MeDougall or
some equally capable man as the locomotive
engineer.
There also appeared before the committee
Mr. Charles W. Peterson. publisher of the
Farm and Ranch Review. At page 118 of
our proceedings I find the following question
and answer:
Q. Mr. Peterson, this morning you made a
very splendid argument from your point of
view in connection with the extreme necessity
of reducing wages. Would you care to suggest
about how much you think they should be
reduced?-A. No, I would not, sir, because
that would be a matter for the system when
unified, and is one of the things that would
have to be studied. I am not competent to
give any information on that at all. When
the war broke out there was a reduction of,
I think, 15 or 20 per cent.
Again. may I without offence characterize
the gentleman's answer as nonsense.
Not
even a reduction in railway wages of one-half
of one per cent was made during the war.
How do I know?
The day that Canada
declared war I was acting as spokesman for
a committee in Winnipeg which appeared
before a board of investigation, presided over
by the late Judge Gunn, of Ottawa. We were
contending for an increase in pay and improvcd conditions of work on behalf of the
Canadian Pacific men. As soon as it was
announced that war had been declared we
were unanimous in stating that we were
through with our proceedings; that, for the
time being, nothing else mattered than to get
on with the war. It was not until October,
1916, when we found that all the industrial
undertakings of Canada, the United States
and other countries were paying very much
higher wages in order to get workers, and
these conditions were attracting railroad men
from the service, that we undertook to get

MAY 26, 1939
better termis fromn the railway. As a result
of our work the men secured a wage increase
of about 10 per cent. From what 1 have said
honourable members will, I believe, concede
that I arn justified in characterizing that
answer of Mr. Peterson's as totally incorrect,
and in assuming that a good deal of the
evidence which hie plaeed before the committee was of equal value.
During last session and this we have heard
a good deal of discussion about the deplorable condition of our railways and the enormous burden that is being placed on the people
of Canada in the formi of taxation. May I
direct the attention of honourable members
to the fact that two or three other modes of
transportation have had something to do
with our railway problem. In this connection
I think it would be relevant to place on
Hansard some inquiries which last session
the honourable member from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé) directed to the Government, and
the answers thereto.
These questions and
answers have to do with railway and highway construction costs and the cost of navigation routes, and are as follows:
Railway and Highway Construction Costs
Inquiry
Hon. Mr. Sauvé inquired of the Government:
1. How much has the construction of railways
cost Canada in the form. of subsidies: (a)
money; (b) land grants?
2. How much has the building of so-called
national, interprovincial and provincial highways
used for motor traffie, trucking and the transport of goods cost the country and the provinces?
3. For how many years have licences been
issued for the circulation of such vehicles?
4. What sums have accrued to, the provinces
from this source?

I shaîl procecd with my remarks as briefly
as possible, because m.y chief bas asked me
to finish within an hour. I will try to do so.
May I again refer to what is involved in

this enormous cost of railway services which
now confront us. My honourable friend the
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas been, may I suggest, a most
enthusiastic booster for a re-alignmcnt. of railway problems in Canada. I think I arn fair,
as I want to be, in saying that first, last and
all the time be bas believed the panacea for
aIl thc railway ilîs of Canada was unification,
and that nothing else would do. There is no
doubt that he sincerely holds that opinion,
and he bas given it to us in scason and out
of season, in the committee and in this House.
Let us sce wbere these railway problemns
originated; these terrible costs we arc being
confronted with ail the time. If you look at
Senate Hansard of May 17, 1916, you will
find our deligbtful and enthusiastic friend
assisting in some measure to place these
enormous railway burdens of to-day upon
the people of Canada. He was speaking in
1916, before I ever dreamed of landing in
such a tribunal as this.

What did hie say?

Talking about the Government taking over
some railways, he said:
What is going to, be the revenue f rom. these
roads, roughly speaking? The two roads that
are now paying a revenue, the Quebec and
Montmorency and the Lotbinière and Megautie,
The Government is now
bring in $83,000.

492

SENATE

spending, because there is no railway on the
north shore, $80,000 that can be saved. It is
paying for the transportation of mail to other
railways about $5,400; for the operation of
the Intercolonial railway, Rivière Ouelle branch,
$22,000, and $52,000 for the ferry from Rivière
Ouelle to Murray Bay, or in round figures
$80,000. Add this saving of $80,000 to the
$83,000 produced by the Quebec and Montmorency and the Lotbinière and Megantie and
you obtain a total of $163,000. Now, honourable
gentlemen, is it not fair to think that the
Quebec and Saguenay will earn something? On
the same ratio of earning per mile as the
Quebec and Montmorency, the Quebec and
Saguenay ought to earn $120,000. Therefore
in savings, in actual and most probable earnings,
we have in sight practically 5 per cent on th e
amount invested. Under these circumstances
I will certainly vote for the Bill.
The purpose of the Bill was to acquire those
particular railways in the province of Quebec.
And what happened? One of the particular
lines which the honourable senator was so
insistently pressing the Government to take
over was the Quebec and Saguenay, 62-3
miles in length. Evidently his earnest plea
to the Government, coupled with other pressing claims of the same kind, was sufficient to
influence the Government to take over that
railroad on the first day of July, 1916.
What was paid for it? The sum of $3,489,313.53. What did it cost in addition, in
betterments for the purpose of rehabilitating
it so that it could be used as a proper railroad? That additional cost was $4,283,597.50.
So, at the behest of my honourable friend the
senator from Montarville and others, more
than $7,600,000 of the railway burden that
we now have was placed upon the shoulders
of the people of Canada.
Has the railroad mentioned ever paid the
5 per cent my honourable friend spoke of?
Was his judgment in May, 1916, good? If it
was not, is it good to-day? I am going to
undertake to show that possibly his views, his
aims, his claims and his desires with respect
ta railway unification to-day are just as farfetched or as unfair to the Canadian tax-payer
as they were in 1916, when $7,600,000 was paid
for a railroad that was never worth $100,000
to the Canadian people.
I see my honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) looking at me. Let us hurry
along. I wonder if, for the purpose of showing
how far my very good friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will go in boosting for
unification, with which he is so much in love,
it would be unfair to quote from his own
speech of a couple of nights ago. He said, as
reported at page 427 of the Senate Hansard:
In any event, is it in the power of our railways to exercise monopoly in a way to hurt
the public? Everybody knows the companies
are completely under the control of the Board
Hon. Mr, MURDOCK.

of Transport Cammissioners. Not a line cau
be abandoned, not a rail can be lifted, not
a train can be cut off, not a single service
can be discontinued, not a fare or rate can
be increased, without permission from that
tribunal.
I leave to the judgment and knowledge of
honourable members the question whether that
is painting a picture which the facts will
not justify.
Not satisfied with having said that, be comes
back to the point later. At page 485 he says:
Do not forget, he spoke of a supine public.
There he was referring to my distinguished
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg your pardon.
I an incorrect. My honourable friend was
referring to Mr. Fairweather. In fact, he
referred ta Mr. Fairweather on many and
various occasions, and critically. He held the
view that Mr. Fairweather's evidence was of
little use.
Following that remark about Mr. Fairweather, my honourable friend said:
Now, I have already shown that the railways
cannot do aaything to the public. The Transport Board plays the part of watch-dog, and
without its permission not one line, not one
car, not one service can be removed; nor can
rates be increased. It is laughable, therefore,
to hear Mr. Fairweather speak of a supine
public.
My honourable friend from Montarville was
just 50 per cent right in that statement. He
was right in saying that the Transport Board's
permission is required for the removal of any
line or the increase of rates, but was wrong
in saying that not one car or one service
could be removed without such permission.
With every new issue of a time-table by
either road some changes of service are made
without reference to the Transport Board.
Of course, the board would have to be
approached before a line could be discontinued
entirely. The point I want to make is that
my honourable friend is so enthusiastic about
the proposal for unification that he goes far
afield, may I say, to emphasize facts in support
of that proposal.
Now we come to the question that is before
us. I speak as a man who for almost fifty
years has been proud to be an employee of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway. At this moment
I hold in my pocket an annual pass over the
Canadian Pacifie Railway system, issued to
me as a conductor on furlough. I have been
on furlough since 1905, and I do not think
I shall work on the railroad any more. Travelling all over the continent of America, I have
always been proud of the Canadian Pacifia
Railway. I know of no railroad that has been

MAY 26, 1939
better managed and better run in the days
that have gone *by. It bas a record of remarkable achievement. But do flot imagine that
I shall continue to 'boost for the Canadian
Pacific throughout my speech.
Let me analyse for a few moments the
extent to whioh the Canadian Pacific Railway
bas been assisted. The Government gave the
company $25,000,000 in cash, and 25,000,000
acres of land in alternate blocks lthroughout
the most productive parts of the Prairie
region, and turned over to it free of charge
the surveys and the 713 miles of railway
already construeted, which had eost $37,785,000. Cash subsidies received by the Canadian
Pacifie lrom Dominion and provincial governments amounted in 1916 to $67,000,000.
Land grants from -the same sources amounted
to 28,000,000 acres, of which 16,541,000 had
been sold up to June 30, 1916, to net the
company $68,000,000, while the remainder
was conservatively valued at $119,000,000.
T-hus it will be seen that the assistance
received by the Canadian Pacifie Railway, in
addition to !other valuable consideratione,
totalled $291,7M,.000.
Other valuable considerations comprise freedomn for eve-r from
taxation of the railway and "ail stations and
station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards
and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital
stock of the company by the Dominion, or
by any province hereafter to be established,
or by any municipal corporation therein;
and the lands of the company, in the North
West Territories, until they are sold or
occupied shall also be free fromn taxation for
twenty years after the grant thereof from the
Crown."
We should neyer consider the Canadian
Pacifie's early existence without recognition
of the fact that the great Canadian West
laboured for many years under a railway
transportation monopoly. We should also
rememnber that the 'Canadian Pacifie carried
settlers andI indunstries into the f ar stretches
of the Canadian West before most of the
lines nbw ineluded in the Canadian National
Railways-the Canadian Northern, the Grand
Trunk Pacifie and the National Transcontinental-were even dreamed of. It is said by
some that the Canadian Pacific was somewhat despotie, that it had a monopoly and
proposed to, use it as it deemed best, and
that the resuits of this policy were' in-jurious
to the rights and properties of settlers, business men and other people.
Now let us consider hriefiy the undertakings
of the Canadian Northern Railway. I think
1 heard my right honourahie friend (Right

493

Hon. Mr. Meighen) say last night that in
diseussing this railway problemn it is net
necessary to go into ancient history. Sometimes it is ineonvenient to be told of our
omissions and 'errors.
I myseif have on
occasions found that to be so. But it seema
to me that we cannot properly analyse this
general railway question unless we consider
to some degree the whole history of the
Canadian National Railway lines that are
now in the West. I am quite sure that my
right honourable friend will be able to, follow
me very closely in these referenees, because
I helieve no member of this House knows
better than he just what is involved. During
the first three years tha-t the Conservative
Government were in office after 1911, the promoters of the Canadian Northern secured
$20,040,000 in cash and guarantees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The honourable member should note there that
those amounts were authorized hy legislation
of the Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Hlon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is a very
proper correction, and I am sure it will be
noted. I am sorry to say to my right honourable friend that I had not noticed the faet.
Maybe that is the result of a slight bias on
my part.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not want
to create an impression that is in the slightest
degree wrong. The authorization applied to
ail the Canadian Northern eastern lines then
projeeted, right through to Montreal, but
not to the Canadian Northern Pacifie, from
Edmonton west.
Hon. Mr. M'UIDOCK: In the early months
of 1914, vocal, insistent and capable representatives deseended in force upon Ottawa
and appeared to literally eompel the Government to advance further eredit to the extent
of $45,000,000. As a resuit the Government
became a partner of Mackenzie & Mann ini the
ownership of the Canadian Northern, by
seeurîng $40,000,000 of the company's $100,000,000 capital stock. The outbreak of the
war found the Canadian Northern in financial
shadows. Not only was the Governinent a
joint owner, but the credit of municipalitiee
and provinces in Canada was in a large
measure affected. In short, the Dominion 's
credit was at stake. The Drayton-Acworth
report in 1916 advised that these new limes
should not; he permitted to go into bankruptcy and that there was a moral responsihility upon the Government to safeguard the
investors. Had the Government of the day
bid good-hye to its holdings of Canadian
Northern liabilities, and sent these new lines

494

SENATE

into bankruptcy and receivership, we should
not to-day be furnishing some of the
proponents of amalgamation or unification
with the earnest plea put forth to save the
Government from paying $50,000,000 a year,
which is simply the amount of fixed charges
on
certain
Canadian
National
railways
acquired in bygone days.
On August 1, 1917, the Government gave
notice that it intended to acquire control of
the remaining capital stock of the Canadian
Northern, other than the $40,000,000 worth
of stock then held. The value of the stock
of the Canadian Northern to be acquired was,
as a result of the decision of a board of arbitration, set at about $11,000,000. Thus the Government assumed financial responsibility for
the Canadian Northern to the extent of more
than $382,000,000.
Two years later, in 1919, the Grand Trunk
Pacific was placed in receivership, the then
Minister of Railways acting as receiver. The
Government had already loaned the Grand
Trunk Pacifie more than S83,000,000. In
connection with the agreement for the building
of that line the Government during the next
three years had to spend an additional $40,000,000 for replacements and operating deficits,
and so the Governmnent's obligations in respect
of the Grand Trunk Pacific increased to more
than 3129,000,000.
In November, 1919, steps were taken for the
acquisition of the Grand Trunk Railway. The
capital stock of the company cost the Government nothing, but the Government assumed
liabilities o! more than $298,000,000; this
in addition to the loans already advanced
the company, amounting to $1,148,000.
At the end of 1922, when all government
railways were brought under one management, the Government became liable for the
following railway expenditures, not including
the monetary advances and other assistance
given to the Canadian Pacifie:

$936,509,412
Furthermore, the Government, in order to
uphold the good name and credit of Canada,
assumed liabilities te the public amounting
to more than 804,000,000. I am reciting these
facts to show where possible errors of judgment in days gone by, on the part of our
well-intentioned public men, are responsible
for the people of Canada now being confronted
with the enormous load of debt which has
been saddled on us and our posterity. Presently I shall undertake to show that maybe
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

some distinguished public men sitting under
this roof at the present moment now propose
to do something which in the years to come
will be just as unfortunate for the taxpayers.
I shall hurry along, pausing only for a
moment to deal with Canadian National
revenues. In 1926 the gross revenue of the
Canadian National Railways reached $270,982,223, providing an income surplus of $41,583,242, or $2,389,009 more than enough to
pay to the public all the interest on the
securities which some years previously the
Government took over as a burden on the
people of Canada.
Although revenues increased in 1927, expenses were relatively
higher; so the National system fell $4,200,628
short of the amount required to meet its
interest charges. In 1928, however, revenues
soared to $304.591,269, providing, after all
interest charges on bonded indebtedness had
been met, a surplus of $2,638,000. That was
the high point. From 1928 until the depth
of the depression was reached in 1933 railway
revenues plunged downward to a low of 8148,Although thousands of employees
519,742.
were dismissed and wholesale economies were
instituted, expenses could not drop as fast as
revenues. Consequently in 1929 the deficit
was $13,408,705; in 1930, $35.585,895; in 1931,
860,869.795; in 1932, $61,006,919; and in 1933,
$60,017,713.
Let me analyse this question a little further.
It is, I think, safe to suggest that few, if any,
railroads in the United States or Canada have
made a better showing from a net operating

will, in part, disclose. The annual net operating revenues from 1923 to 1936 for both the

In short, the Canadian National Railway
system earned its fixed charges in only two
years since its establishment. Since 1927 the
Government has lost from $4,000,000 to $61,000,000 on account of the inability of the railway system to earn its fixed charges or the
accrued interest due the Government, and

MAY 26, 1939
this accrued interest stands to-day as a charge
of more than $3,000,000,000 against the people
of Canada, largely as a result of the magnanimous action of certain gentlemen in the years
from 1911 to 1921. And may I, in all kindness, say that my right honourable friend
opposite is included in this quota .of magnanimous gentlemen.
I come now to the appointment of the Duff
Commission. In November, 1931, Canada's
railway problem had become acute; so Prime
Minister Bennett secured the appointment of
a royal commission of distinguished gentlemen, including Chief Justice Sir Lyman P.
1uff as chairman, Lord Ashfield, of London,
England, the late Sir Joseph Flavelle, of
Toronto, Mr. L. F. Loree, President of the
Delaware and Hudson Railway of New York,
and three other gentlemen of ability. That
commission was fully authorized to survey
the entire field of Canada. The presidents
of the Canadian Pacifie and the Canadian
National Railways, with other members of
their executive staffs, appeared before the
commission. It was contended by Sir Edward
Beatty that a saving of $75,000,000 could be
made in the operation of Canada's railways
by what was then called amalgamation and
is now called unification. The net result of
this recommendation was that the commission reported as follows:
We have carefully weighed the informing
and voluminous evidence which has been placed
before us in regard to a subject of major
importance to the Canadian people and, in
arriving at our conclusions and making our
recommendations, we have endeavoured to
eliminate any considerations as to what might
be theoretically the best course to pursue under
other circumstances and in other countries, and
to base our judgment solely on what is best
for the people of Canada.
The complete amalgamation of the two systems has been suggested as a method, not only
for attaining a measure of economy, but also
for the most effective use of the properties.
This raises the question whether it may be
done either by public or private ownership.
Whatever merits or demerits this proposal may
have, the time is not opportune for giving
serious consideration to this particular remedy;
neither complete public nor complete private
ownership is possible.
To establish a monopoly of such magnitude
and importance would place in the hands of
those responsible for the administration of the
system powers that would, if not properly exercised, prejudice the interests of the Dominion
as a whole.
It has also been suggested that the Canadian
National Railways should be leased to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, either in perpetuity or
for such a period as would afford an opportunity
to effect substantial economies.
A lease in perpetuity presents certain difficulties. It would, whatever safeguards may be
adopted, result in the establishment of a
monopoly.

Other considerations which militate against
a perpetual lease are twofold: first, should the
population of Canada greatly increase, the
volume of traffic would grow and the railway
mileage be materially enlarged, with the result
that the management of so great a system
might well become unwieldy and necessitate
segregation. The second reason is a natural
and justifiable hesitation to commit, finally,
future generations, and even the present one,
to a policy adopted under the stress of difficult
circumstances which may not be best adapted
to a new set of conditions difficult to forecast.
From the date of the pronouncement of the
Duff Commission on the railway question,
the President of the Canadian Pacifie started,
and has earnestly continued, a campaign of
propaganda looking toward unification of
railways. To-day certain honourable gentlemen opposite and some to my right are
backing that campaign, in disregard of very
probable serious results, which would mean
increased liabilities for Canadian taxpayers
and a resumption of dividends to Canadian
Pacifie shareholders.
May I be pardoned if for a moment I deal
briefly with a little of the history of this
project because of the fact that my honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
and, I think, also my right honourable friend
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) referred
to a unanimous declaration of this House in
1925 with respect to a solution of our railway
problem. I wonder if the majority of honourable members know how that committee of
fourteen members was appointed by the Senate
and in what manner they conducted its
proceedings. They sat in camera and called
before them chosen individuals to present a
certain view. Am I unfair in dealing with
this point? My justification is that last
night my right honourable friend referred to
the dead, and therefore I hope I shall not be
crjticized if I follow his example. May I
suggest that among the fourteen inembers
appointed by this Senate to do that job in
camera one at least was a director of thp
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company or of
allied companies?
That committee made a report, to which
we have been repeatedly referred. I realize
that the amendment moved by my honourable
friend from Montarville does not contemplate
resumption of dividends to Canadian Pacifie
shareholders. The proposal made last year did
contemplate it, and that is what we were up
against then. That was the important part
of the report of the committee of 1925resumption of dividends to the Canadian
Pacifie shareholders. To-day that is a hot
brick, and we must not touch it: the idea
might not be popular. Before I sit down I
shall endeavour to show that now we have
something more efficacious than that proposal.

496

SENATE

Let me for a moment refer again to the report
of 1925. I wonder whether many honourable
members are aware of the fact that I am
trying to present. Under date of June 25,
1925, a distinguished member of that special
committee--who has since passed on to the
Great Beyond-in presenting the report to
the Senate said:
I produce some figures which do not appear
in the report. The additional national obligations of this country for the last five years were
nearly $600,000,000, and for the last six years
$710,000,000.
Please note what follows:
Now the capitalization and bonded indebtedness of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company
on the 31st December, 1924, were as follows:
Ordinary stock, $260,000,000; 4 per cent preferor a total of
ence stock, $100,148,587.78;
$360,148,587.78.
In addition, there was 4 per cent consolidated
debenture stock to the amount of $264,244,882.08;
10-year 5 per cent collateral trust gold bonds
to the amount of $12,000,000; 20-year 4½ per
cent sinking fund secured note certificates
amounting to $30,000,000; and mortgage bonds,
Algona Branch first mortgage, 5 per cent,
of
or a total capitalization
$3,650,000;
$670,043,469.86. This is on the Canadian Pacifie
property.
Furthermore, there are obligations on subsidiary companies, which he enumerates at
page 736 of Hansard of 1925.
Then he goes on to say:
-making a total of $35,015,000. Added to the
$670,043,469.86, this makes a total of $705,058,000. Apart from that, there are amounts
due for rentals of railway, amounting to
$1,557,355.
So that the whole capitalization,
including bonding liability and rentals, amounts
to a littIe over $700,000,000.
Let us see what our unification proponents
are now putting up to us. Do not forget that

regarded as unfair in saying, as nany of us
claim the right to say, that the capitalization
has been increased nearly 100 per cent in
recent years with a view to the important
moment that bas now arrived, when the
honourable senator from Montarville and
others expect a vote from this House in
favour of unification. An increase of one
hundred per cent, less about $1,500,000, over
the figure mentioned by a director of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway in speaking to this
House in 1925!
I must hurry along. I have just referred
to what was done here in 1925. This Senate
appointed a committee of fourteen senators;
they met in camera, and they brought in a
report in favour of unification, with guaranHon. Mr. MURDOCK.

teed dividends to the Canadian Pacific. Why
did they do so? I told you a little while
ago that I had been in the railway game for
a few years. I am confident that the whole
idea originated in 1925 in the minds of two
or three distinguished gentlemen who wanted
the Government of Canada to take over the
Dominion Atlantic Railway. I was working
down east around that time, and know something about the matter. At least, I was
closely in touch with some of the things
developing down there, and my humble
opinion, which, of course, I cannot prove, is
that it was for that reason a committee was
appointed to sit in camera and talk to whomever they liked. Is it not fair to believe, as
I do conscientiously believe, that two or
three of the distinguished gentlemen who
were heard in camera were much interested
financially in the Dominion Atlantic, which
had been at its wits' end for a considerable
number of years, and which it was hoped
would be taken over by someone in such a
way as to give some little hope to the shareholders of that company? However, unification did not come about.
And what was the Canadian Pacifie Railway doing during this time? The Canadian
Pacific paid to its shareholders the following
amounts in dividends:
1926, $30.005.944;
1927, $30.005.944;
1928, $33,421,180; 1929,
$35,424.790; 1930, $38.248,530.
In short, the
Canadian Pacifie in those five years paid its
shareholders more than $167,000.000 in dividends, while net earnings during the same
period amounted to more than $217,000,000.
Now I want to refer to the report of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway for 1932. Remember, I have just told you the Canadian
Pacific paid dividends arnounting to $38,000.000 odd in 1930. What about 1932, two short
years later? The annual report of the Canadian Pacifie Railway for 1932 says:
With the greatest regret your directors must
announce that the general situation, and the
result of the year's operation, preclude the
possibility of any further distribution for the
year 1932 to either preference or ordinary
stockholders. The excellent wheat crop, the
fourth largest in ten years, gave promise of
an important increase in gross earnings, but
the decline in the market which commenced
early in October and continued to the end of
the year, interrupted its movement, with the
result that such traffic was only slightly better
than in the corresponding period of 1931. With
this decline in the basic industry of the country
disappeared also the hope which had been
entertained of an increase of general traffic.
Your directors eau only continue to exhort
patience until the turn of the tide.
Then we come along to 1937 and we find
something wonderfully edifying in the report.

SENATE

It is only fair to say that the figures given
in these tables are as of 1937, and a 10 per
cent increase has since been awarded to most
of these employees. May I take a moment to
point out to my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that out
of the total of 121,541 employees, 6,670 were
getting less than $60 a month; 4,597 were
getting between $66 and $75; 22,140 were getting between $76 and $85, and, as we see a
little further on, 28,824 employees had
monthly earnings of between $111 and $125.
As I have said, to consider these earnings
properly we must increase most of them by
10 per cent.
But when this increase has
been added it will be found, unfortunately,
that Canadian railway employees do not
receive as high wages as was indicated the
other day by my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
Let me hurry forward. I am now up to
the point of considering the alternative report
proposed in amendment by the honourable
senator from Montarville. Would it be treadng on foreign soil to refer to the fact that
this alternative report as it came from the
committee bore the signature of nine members? The fact is that, very much to the
regret of all members of the committee, one
ni those who signed the report was not able
to attend a single sitting of the committee this
session, and three others were not in attendanee at the last two or three sittings. In these
circumstances, I am wondering where we are,
from a parliamentary standpoint. The motion
made in committee by my distinguished
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) for adoption
of the report which is now before the House
was carried, as I recall, by a vote of seven to
six. Yet we have had brought in by way of
amendment what is called an alternative
report, signed, as I say. by nine members, of
whom one was not present at any of the
committee's sittings and three others were
not present for the last two or three days.
However, that is only an aside.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Where is that
report?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I find it here before
me in No. 11 of this year's proceedings of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

So far as I know, it has

me a copy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

That may be.

But I

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You should "stick
around."
I now come to an analysis of that alternative
report, for whatever it is worth. Please do
not forget that I am a Canadian Pacifie man.
and proud of it, but at the same time I have,
as I regard it, a sworn duty to perform for tho
Canadian people.
The report, which was
presented to the committee by my right
honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), concludes with eight unification
objpctives. Before my right honourable friend
spoke last night I really believed in my heart
-this

may be entirely due to ignorance on

my part-that these eight objectives were
written by a gbost writer. I saw an editorial
in the Ottawa Journal a couple of days ago
about a ghost writer, by the way. To my
mind it appeared to be evident that these
objectives were written by some person of
that kind.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If they were,
then I was the ghost. I may tell the honourable gentleman that I wrote every word of
them.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I think so.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: After I had listened
to my righ.t honourable friend last night, I felt
convinced that he was the writer of these
eight paragraphs. But the realization of this
came as somewhat of a surprise to me, though
I am aware of his great ability as a lawyer,
a member of Parliament and a former Prime
Minister of this country, and his wide
experience. And of course I am aware that
he is quite capable of effecting co-ordination,
unification or amalgamation of this or that
concern, along lines similar to those recommended here.
The first of these objectives is:
There should be no obligation, legal or moral,
implied or expressed, whereby the country
assumes any liability in respect of Canadian
Pacifie obligations or securities, either as to
capital or interest.
How magnanimous, how considerate of the
Canadian people and taxpayers, that sounds!
How I. as a Canadian Pacifie man, resented it
when I first read it! I asked myself, is it
possible that after the enormous expenditures
Canada made upon the Canadian Northern,
the Grand Trunk Pacifie and other roads, we
are going to unite the Canadian Pacific with
the Canadian National and say to the

MAY 26, 1939
Canadian Pacific that in so doing we shaîl
assume no iiability, legal or moral, impiied
or expressed, in respect of its obligations or
securities?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is Sir Edward
Beatty's suggestion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Ah! This appears
to be beautifuliy rounded sales talk, which no
doubt wiil be largely aibsolrbed by many
Canadians, who will argue that, considering the
source from *hich it comes, this wiil be the
principie adopted. Can any of us here think
that the Canedian Pacific is not deserving
of treatment as magn-animous as that given
to the Canadian Northern, Grand Trunk
Pacific and other liues which in. years gone by
have been taken over? But let us flot worry
about that paragraph, for I shall show that
this turning of the coid shoulder is atoned for
in paragraphs containing other objectives.
Before we get to the eighth paragraph we shal
see how magnanimous the author of these
objectives rwas towards the Canadian Pacific.
The second objective is:
Any plan of unified management adopted
should be sueh that the resulting operation can
in no sense be dominated by the Canadian
Pacifie Raiiway Company.
That sounds fine. I think it can be safely
said that the officiais of the Canadian Pacifie
Raiiway have done the best continuous railroading job on the North American continent
in the last forty-five or fifty years, but this
paragraph would appear to imply that the
company and its officiais are to be relegated
to the shadows of unified operation. 0f course,
that is flot intended. That is oniy a part of
the sales talk which is used in pressing for
the dlaims towards which the Canadian Pacifie,
and particularly the president of that company,
have been aspiring ever since the Duif Commission turned down their dlaims.
Then we come to objective No. 3. Listen to
this. It is really good. For the purposes
desired it is as well donc as any client could
wish. It reads:
Out of earnings up to the average aggregate
earnings of bot h systema over such a period
of years as may be agreed upon, the Canadian
National must be assured the same share of
such earnings as it has enjoyed of such average
earnings.
What does that mean? On account of the
enormous burden that my right honourable
friend and other friends placed upon the
Canadian National in years gone by, that
system bas 'been in the red ever since 1920,
except for two years, and consequently there
would be no earnings to average under this
proposai. Here again we find sorne wonderfui
salies promotion. What screams of anguish

501

we have heard from certain honourable gentlemnen about the enormous burden of Canada's
railway debt on the people of Canada! Under
this proposai the $50,000,000, more or less, of
Canadian National Railways fixed. charges,
upon which iLtbas flot been possible to make
earnings during some years of the depreasion,
are to be lef t as charges upon the Canadian
people, and a fifty-fifty share of average aggregate earnings is to be given to the Canadian
Pacific and the Canadian National. What
about the saving of $75,000,000? 'May I say,
without any disrespect to anybody, thgt I thinýk
that estimate was only theoretical Ibuncombe
from the start.
Let us proceed to objective No. 4:
Out of earnings above such average earnings,
which presumably will be earnings due to
economies effected by unified management, the
Canadian National should receive flot less than
one-half.
How generous this proposai is to the
suffering Canadian taxpayers! They are to
receive not less than one-haîf of the earnings
which. exceed average earnings. What for?
To pay the Canadian National Railways on
the $50,000,000 of fixed charges. And the
Canadian Pacifie is presumably to receive the
other haîf of earnings which. are above average earnings. What for? To pay to Canadian Pacifie security holders. We might ask
if this is not rather one-sided, considering
that the Canadian National Railways have
22,000 miles of raiiways, as compared with
the Canadian Pacific's 17,000 miles, and,
according to evidence given before our
committee, the Canadian National Railways
now have exclusive access to the moat important of the great mining areas of northern and
western Canada, such as Flin Fion, Red Lake
and Rouyn. The Canadian National bas
been getting a revenue out of these districts
for a number of years, and the Canadian
Pacific naturaiiy covets a share of it. It wiii
be remembered that iast year a distinguished
representative of the Canadian Pacifie urged
that that company shouid if possible be permitted access into Red Lake. The proposed
unification would of course give the Canadian
Pacifie access to these great mining areas
and cut approximately in haif the earnings
by the Canadian National on behaîf of the
taxpayer. This proposai is fearfully and
w.onderfuliy made.
The fifth objective is this:
New capital investments. limited as they will
be to joint requirements, should be provided
for on a basis of definite and individual responsibility for respective shares of the capital on
the part of the Canadian National (or of the
Dominion of Canada), on the one hand, and of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company on the
other hand.

502

SENATE

If unification of our railways is to be put
into effect, this paragraph would appear to
be reasonably consistent and, in fact, jn line
with the only business-like way of dealing
with the question mentioned.
Objective No. 6 is:
Both parties should agree to such enlargement of the powers and supervision of the
Board of Transport Commissioners as xnay be
deemed necessary te protect and serve every
public interest.
Here wve have the first striking example of

the octopus of railwny unification in Canada.
This proposai would appear to imply that
the Canadian people and Parliament have
ne say in deflning the powers and supervision
of the Board of Transport Comnmissioners;
that this matter is in the hands of officiais
of the two railways.
Then we Punie to objective No. 7:
In view of the very extensive economies te
be attained, and te the end that the process
may net invoive undue hardship on anyone,
provision sheuid be made for the due protect ionNote the words, please.
-by both systems, of labeur adversely affected
by such econemies, aieng the lines iatoly
followed by the railways of Great Britain.
Oh, how magnanimous, how conciderate of the
25,000 te 40.000 empieyees whom it is proposed te let eut of their jobs! This is a
carefully hiddee proposai fer the assistance of
the Canadian Pacifie shareholders.
Please
note the language, "due protection by beth
systems of labour adversely affected." No proposai frorn the pool respecting revenue te
take care of labour adverseiy affected, but
each compenent part, namely, the Canadian
Pacific or Canadian National, is te give due
protection te labour. Can we net even new
visualize the campaige of rivairy contempiated
by this proposai te retain, for example, the
ciericai forces of the Canadian Pacifie at
Montreai, while scrapping the Canadian
National Raiiway's cierical forces as redundant? Again, pan we net visualize the same
generai effort being made at Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary? It
wouid net of course ýbe possible at Moncton
and Halifax. Fearfuliy and wonderfully proposed. It could net have been put in laniguage
more saifeguiarcling for the Canadian Pacifie if
it had been prepared, word for word, by the
officiais of that company. The same thing
applies te shop men. My honeurabie frîend
frem Winnipeg South-Centre
(Hon. Mr.
Haig) can, 1 think, visualize right now the
Transcona shops scrapped and ail work at
Winnipeg being done at the Canadian Pacific
Raiiway shops, whîch are amply sufficient te
Hon. Mr. MURDOCR.

meet ail demands. Thousands and thousands
of cierical ernployees and shop mon would be
unioaded upon the Canadian people under
whatever drastie legisiation might be enacted
for the purpose.
I cerne now te paragraph 8:
Agreement te ail provisions shouid ho
ohtained f rom each separate class of security
holders of the Canadian Pacifie and of the
Canadian National. in se far as such latter
security heiders are not aiready protected hy
Goverement guarantee.
0f course thoy are. A very intorestiog and
apparently logicai paragraýph of the proposals
which contemplate giving the Canadian Gevernment and the Caniadian peopie equal status
with the Citizens' Shareheiders Greup for
Raiiway Action, functioning in Toronto and
eisewhore, in determining their comparative
rights. Ie short, 61,140 Canadian Pacifie shareholders in Great Britain and the United States
are te ho asked te vote whether the jobs of
fromn 25,000 te 40,000 mon on the railroads of
Canada are te be scrapped in order that those
shareholders may get dividends as they did
from 1926 te 1930. That is what that paragraph means; nething more nor less.
I suggest that the eight paragraphs wore
carefuily pre-pared with a view te conserving
first. last and ail the time the rights and
interests of the Canadian Pacifie and its sharehoiders, in absolute disregard of ail other
rights and interests. I know many honourable
members will net agree with me ie this,
but I arn confident that if they will de me the

kindness te liston, seine of them who may be
here after I arn gene wiil appreciate what we
are -oing into. I repeat, this means simply
no thing more nor less than placing an additionai burden of millions of dollars upon
the Canadian taxpayers fer the express purpose of re-estabiishing the payrnent of dividcnds te Canadian Pacifie shareholders. I
believe that has been the underiying desire
of the Canadian Pacifie president and of those
who have been supperting his pica for unification.
What a sight we have witnessed this siession
and last, with four, five, eight or ton lobbyists9
ever -present and on the job te congratulate
this or that fellow on his nice speech! No
one wiil cengratulate me when I beave the
Chamber. Those lobbyists are pleased te
give their friends pointers. They will not,
give me any. The Canadian Pacifie interests
rnanufactured "phoney" labeur organizations.
I can prove my charge if given an oppertunity te put somebody on oath. Those
"phoney" labeur associations were organized
te boost their dlaim that they might continue
te bear down upon the Canadian taxpayer on

MAY 26, 1939
the pretence of relieving him of the 860,000,000
a year that he is now liable for in respect of
guarantees on railway stocks and bonds. As
a matter of fact, the ultimate purpose is to
divide up the paying freight that cornes frorni
the great mining areas of Canada and other
important pointe now reached only by the
Canadian National Railways; to enable the
Canadian Paciflc to encroach thereon and get

503

some of the ready cash and revenue that the
stockholders so eagerly desire.
Before I conclude I would ask permission
to put certain exhibits on Hansard. The first
is exhibit No. 2, from page 37 of the proceedings of our Special Railway Cornmittee
in 1938. It refers to miles of road operated
by the Canadian National and the Oanadian
Pacifie.

No doubt honourable members will recal

intention to divide the revenue fifty-fifty between the Canadian Pacifie and the Canadian
National. I ask honourable members to study
this exhibit and see if that is a fair division,
with approximately four miles of Canadian
National to every three miles of Canadian
Pacifie. I would also ask my honourable

I should also like to place on Hansard

in 1938. These exhibits give in tabulated forin
the investments of the two railway systems.
I would suggest that they be carefully analyed
before we decide that the Canadian Pacifie
shareholders are entitled to a 50 per cent
division as against the Canadian taxpayer.

In

conclusion,

may

I say that were I

following the personal bent of a proud connection that fifty years have given me as a
Canadian Pacifie employee, I should vote
for the amendment of my honourable friend
from Montarville; but I should regard it as
a disgrace to my Canadianism if I committed

wbat, in my hunmble judgment, would be a
crime against the Canadian taxpayer for the
benefit of 61,140 shareholders of the Canadian
Pacifie in Great Britain and the United States.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I arn sure my good friend frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) will pardon me
if under the circumistances I do not attempt
to reply to ahl that he has said on this
occasion. There is a time factor that to a
certain extent we mnust take into consideration, and, personally, I arn strongly inclined
to tbink it is well that that time factor
appears in our debate. However, while I

shaîl not attempt to deal with bis lengtby
speech in any way, 1 do wisb to point out,
in regard to what I might cail the major
portion osf bis argument, that it bas no substantial foundation wbatever. I will point
out very briefly what I mean. This report
does not put into effect unified management,
or unification, or anything else. Ail it does
is to express the views of some members of
this House.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, no; there ie
more than tbat.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I must ask my hion.
oura-ble friend to permit me to proceed.
Unified management cannot corne into effeet
in any way, shape or form except under an
agreement made by the Government of the
day witb the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Further than that,
unified management cannot come into effect
until Parliament itself approves of it. When
that time comes the honourable gentleman
opposite will have his chance to vote in
accordance with that confidence of his which
he has expressed so strongly this afternoon.
The main purpose of a debate such as we
are now engaged in is the clarification of all
the facts and issues involved, in order that
every member may exercise his best judgment
when the time comes to cast his vote for or
against the proposals before us. I am sure
that, whatever may be our individual opinions
on the question, all will agree that the real
issues at stake have gradually but surely taken
shape as the debate has proceeded, and little
more now remains to be done than to record
the decision we have reached. The issues
are now pretty well crystallized, and not much
further discussion is needed in order that every
honourable member may have a clear understanding of them.
As I witnessed the earnest, forceful efforts
of our two leaders to drive home their points,
pro and con, I could not help feeling a regret
that circumstances are such as to require
that J should not. engage in the debate in a
similarly vigorous manner. I mist exercise
restraint that I should much prefer to cast
aside.
All honourable senators who have preceded
me in this debate have indicated the very
complicated nature of the problem which
your committee was called upon to consider.
It involved a mass of figures and an array
of technicalities and other difficulties that
at times were soinewhat appalling. However,
with patience and perseverence we concluded
our work, and I am certain that when our
inquiry closed every member of the cornmittee had a much broader grasp of the
entire railway situation.
To attempt to discuss this problem in all
its aspects and to sift and analyse the mass
of evidence presented would, I am sure,
necessitate an unusually lengthy statement.
This, se far as possible, I intend to avoid.
It would be impossible to deal at all adequately with the situation in less than two
or three hours, and se those who have
spoken have tried to confine their remarks
within at most an hour. However, on this
occasion, when the matter is before us for
general discussion, I feel that those of our
members who were not members of our
committee are entitled to an expression of
my views respecting at least some of the
more important phases of the problem as
presented to us in evidence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

We now have before us two reports. I shall
not refer to thern at any length. As the
suggested report presented by my desk-mate
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) sets forth clearly,
logically and systematically a summary of the
main features of the material evidence
submitted, as well as the conclusions reached
and the reasons therefor, it seems to me that
any extensive analysis or elaboration on my
part, of the many details of this report, would
serve no useful purpose. The report speaks
for itself. I may say that I have read the
report with the greatest care, in the light of
all the evidence and of the duty we were
called upon to perform, and I have no hesitation in saying that it meets with my full
approval.
At the outset of my remarks I desire to
direct attention to, and briefly comment upon,
a few of the statements contained in the
original report presented by the right honourable member from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham).
In the first place,.it seems to me that the
lengthy references to the various services
performed by both our railways, but more
particularly by the National system, might
have been omitted, -as all the services are well
known, fully understood and appreciated.
Large railway systems in new and develo.ping countries the world around are always
planned, built, expanded and operated for
purposes generally similar to those referred to,
and unless I am very much mistaken the
government of every country concerned has
always contributed very substantially to these
undertakings. The contribution has been made
by cash subsidies, guarantees, land grants,
exemptions, and loans, and by various other
Here in Canada no person will
mcthods.
deny that so far as all these pioneering
services, as they may be called, are concerned,
the State in the past has given an abundance
of assistance to the companies in order that
the services might be performed and carried
on. Under the circumstances, and for very
obvious reasons, your committee did not tn
any appreciable extent deal with this phase
of our railway development.
The problern that faced your committee was
not to inquire into the reasons why our railroads exist, where their rails are laid, what
services they render, or what assistance has
been given to them in the past by the State.
The only question that confronted your
committee may be ýparaphrased and summarized in this way. We have in Canada two
railway systems, each performing well-known
and desirable services that must be continued.
Owing, however, to a very marked change in
conditions, both systems have
economic

MAY 26, 1939
suffered severely in recent years, and will
continue to suffer, decreasing earning power,
with consequent grave hardship to thousands
of railway employees and enormous losses to
the owners of both properties. In the one case
the lasses are confined to those whose savings
and capital are invested in the property; in
the other they are carried by means of an
onerous tax burden which bears .upon all our
people.
With this situation confronting Canada, the
Senate decided the question should be inquired
into by a special committee, and that committee was charged directly and specifically
with the duty of examining into any and every
method that could be suggested to lighten this
tax burden, with a view to determining which
would be the best method for the purpose.
That duty we have performed. That, and
that only, was the responsibility cast upon
your committee. In other words, in so far as
I can understand the reference, we had no
instructions whatever to ascertain plausible
reasons or excuses for the continuation of
the burdensome tax I have referred ta. We
were not asked to search the whole record of
the past in order to discover some excuse or
reason for our people continuing to carry that
tax. Our duty was to search for any and
every means whereby the tax might possibly
be reduced.
The references made in the original report
to the effect that the Canadian Pacific system
has been able to survive, that it is not alarmed
over the outlook, and that it is in a position
to maintain its independent existence for
years to come, are all in accordance with
parts of the evidence given by Sir Edward
Beatty. But these statements picked out from
the record and placed, as they are, in this
report, are very misleading in that hey do
not in any sense present a true picture of the
very serious financial straits of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company.
Yes, the Canadian Pacifie has been able
to survive, and it will continue to exist as
an independent company, but at what a cost
to its shareholders, to its employees, and to all
Canada as well! For twenty years or more
prior to 1931 those who invested their savings
in Canadian Pacific Railway common stock
received yearly dividends totalling $33,500,000.
In 1931 this figure was eut in half; and since
1931, that is, for a period of eight years, no
holder of the common stock of the Canadian
Pacifie has received one dollar by way of
dividend. But that is not all. The value of
the common stock itself, representing millions
of dollars, has virtually disappeared. Yes,
the Canadian Pacifie Railway may continue
to exist, and Sir Edward Beatty may say,
"We do not fear the future"; nevertheless

509

those are the facts. Indeed during recent
years the earnings of the Canadian Pacifie
have decerased to such an extent that there
has been withheld from those who invested
their money in the concern no less than something in the neighbourhood of $39,500,000 a
year. We cannot hold the view that this
situation has not affected the Canadian Pacifie
Railway most seriously.
There have been very many complimentary
references to the Duif Commission, and
deservedly so. In the original and in the
suggested report, both of which are now before
us, the authors have deemed it advisable to
quote one passage from the report of that
commission; and as it has a direct bearing
on the matter to which I am now alluding,
I should like to refer to it again.
A serious warning was given in the Duff
report to the Parliament of Canada and to all
the people of Canada. What was it? It
may be summarized in this way: "Unless
Parliament adopts our proposal,"-which was
voluntary co-operation, with an arbitral board
--- 'or some other equally effective measure
to secure the efficient and economical working
of both systems, the only courses open to
Parliament will be (a) to effect savings in
national expenditures in other directions, or
(b) to add to the tax burdens under whieh
all our people and all our industries are
suffering." That is to say, unless Parliament could find some means of putting a stop
to the railway conditions existing seven years
ago, there could be only one result. Seven
years have gone by since that warning was
voiced by a commission which everybody
recognizes as being a thoroughly capable and
competent commission, whose report was
commended by everybody.
What has Parliament done during these
seven years to ameliorate our railway problem,
as well as our general financial condition?
In 1933 Parliament adopted and put into
effect the Duff Commission proposal for cooperation. Every member of either House
of Parliament now knows it has been a dismal failure, and that as it stands on our
Statute Book to-day it will continue to be a
dismal failure. This failure is due largely, if
not entirely, to -the almost complete absence
of a singleness of purpose; to a lack of desire
to co-operate to the fullest possible extent
with a view to providing all necessary public
services at the lowest possible cost. Your
committee was continually confronted with
evidence indicating that the co-operative
machinery was all cluttered up with the
human and selfish elements involved in the
continued maintenance of existing properties
a,nd facilities. I trust honourable members
clearly understand what I mean. Each group

MAY 26, 1939
The Duff Commission warned the people
of Canada that the very financial structure
of this country would be in danger unless
something was done; and we all agreed that
something -should be done. Let us see what
has happened in the seven-year period since
the commission reported. Canadian National
deficits have been on the increase during that
time. Our whole financial position is worse
to-day than it was seven years ago. Would
anyone deny that federal expenditures have
increased? They have expanded and are continuing increasingly to expand in all directions.
And is our national debt any lower than it
was seven years ago? Not at all. On the
contrary, millions have been added to it. Then,
will anybody say that our taxation in Canada
is on a smaller scale than it was seven years
ago? There never was a time when so much
money was taken from our people as is now
being taken. If during the last seven years
we have accomplished nothing more than the
few co-operative measures that have been put
into effect, and if we are unable to do something to avoid the danger which the Duff
Commission said was threatening the very
financial foundations of our country, then I
say that the commission's report is not worth
the paper it was printed on. If that report
was correct in its references to our financial
situation, then I say that our failure to make
worth-while economies during the last seven
years should cause us to feel very much
ashamed. Unless we in this House and all
other members of Parliament take some
effective means to remedy the existing condition, we shall be evading our duty to the
country.
There is in the original report another
statement with which I wish to deal. In
the fourth paragraph on page 450 of the committee's proceedings of this year reference is
made to the failure or refusal of the Canadian Pacifie Railway to disclose vital information, which made it-here I am quoting"impossible for the committee to give consideration to the proposals included in the
larger sphere of savings." In other words, it
is represented in this report that the Canadian
Pacifie refused to give us what is here termed
vital information, which it is said we needed
in order to arrive at a fair and proper conclusion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Quite correct.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, but not fair. It
is quite correct that the company refused to
give this information, but the question of
whether or not such information is vital must
be judged by this Chamber. In my view, all
senators who were not members of our committee are entitled to be told the kind of

511

information that was asked for, the reason
why it was requested and the grounds on
which it was refused. I want all honourable
members to have a clear understanding of our
committee's position in this regard. We had
a good deal of discussion about it. We were
dealing with masses of figures relating to
costs and savings, and all that sort of thing,
and one element in the committee took the
ground that unless the Canadian Pacific gave
certain definite information with regard to
estimated savings we could not do anything.
And the Canadian Pacific refused to give
that information.
Now let us sec what was wanted. I can
best deal with the matter by citing a few
illustrations.
1. In the town A, served by both systems,
there are two stations, one of which could,
under unified management, be closed. Why?
There is no doubt that one of the stations
is nut needed, and money could be saved by
closing it.

2. Similarly, in the city B there are two
railway shops, one of which would not continue to be necessary. There is no question
as to that either.
3. On. the railroads between the urban
centres C and D, four passenger trains and
three local freight trains are run daily,
whereas two passenger and two freight trains
could readily handle all the business offered
-a saving of three trains.
4. In the present railway set-up between
the city E and the town F there are two
branch lines operating, closely parallel to
each other. for a distance of eighty miles.
One of these lines could be discontinued
without in any way seriously affecting the
public interest. I may not have the exact
mileage there, but as a matter of fact the
railway companies inquired into that and have
agreed upon the abandonment, and either it
bas been carried out or the proposal is now
before the Transport Board.
5. Within a given area containing any
villages, towns or cities, the total existing
average passenger and freight traffic is
known. There is no question about that.
The books of both companies were open.
Railway officials knew exactly the traffic that
was being carried within that area by both
systems. At present this traffic is handled
separately by the two companies, but it was
estimated that if the facilities of both were
joined, large economies could be effected
because of combination of trains, increased
car loadings, and shorter haulage, and on
many other accounts.

512

SENATE

The particular or so-called vital information
desired in connection with these and ail like
cases was what? The honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) repeatedly
demanded from the Canadian Pacifie Railway
representatives the name of every town, city
and village that would be affected by any of
these changes. He said: " Disclose it aIl.
Tell me exactly where these savings will be
made. What stations are to be closed, what
lines are to be abandoned, what alterations
do you intend to make in the routing of
traffic? Tell us ahl that sort of thing." The
Canadian Pacifie said, "No, we will not tell
you that at ail." Because that information
was not given-and I am sure every honourable member will agree that it should not be
givenRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -we were told, "We
have no means of testing these figures which
were submitted for consideration." I think
the quite natural and correct answer to aIl
those questions was that the economies could
be effected and could be measured, but that
the precise manner in which eacb economy
should bo brought about by the use of facilities
of both systems could be determined enly by
the board of unified management. The Canadian Pacifie stated that it would be unfair,
unreasonable and very prejudicial to its
interests to disclose at this time to its competitor the precise places where ail these
economies could be made and the possible or
likely use that would have to be made of the
facilities of both systems to secure this end.
We beard during our inquiry a good deal
about propaganda agencies. I can imagine
that the representatives of some propaganda
agencies were not very far away, with their
ears wide open to get the names of aIl the
places where economies were to be effected,
and that there would have been sent from
coast to coast news of the dire calamities to
fall upon aIl those communities very soon
after our committee had in any way suggested
that unification should be carried out. I say
advisedly that the information was sought
net for the purpose of aiding us to determine
whether economies could or should fbe made,
but for the purpose of creating trouble between
the two companies.
On the other hand, the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company had its yardsticks to
measure ail economies of this character. Quite
naturally, these were attacked by its conpetitor. Efforts were made in many ways to
get over this difficulty, and finally we moved
in the committee that in order to ascertain the
accuracy of these yardsticks an independent
firm of railway accounting experts should be
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

engaged to test them. The motion was voted
down, and as a consequence we did not have
the advantage of such a test. I have often
wondered why our proposal was rejected. I
do not like to be suspicious like my honourable friend across the way. He sees something
wrong in everything.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But I have a suspicion
that those who opposed the testing of the
yardsticks were just a bit fearful of the result.
There was a possibility that any reliable firm
of experts would clearly indicate that the
Canadian Pacifie was using the proper yardsticks. At any rate, we know from the evidence that the Canadian Pacifie did not
hesitate te say: "There are our estimates.
They are correct. We stand by them. There
are the yardsticks by which we arrive at
those estimates, and we are prepared to have
any independent, responsible firm of railway
accountants come in and test them in any
way they like."
Did the Canadian National take a similar
position? They filed ail kinds of evidence.
Last night the right honourable gentleman
who sits to my left (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
dealt with seme of those estimates and showed
us how they had been changed again and
again. Were the Canadian National officials
prepared te have those estimates examined
and tested by an independent firm of responsible accounting and engineering experts? No,
never at any stage of our inquiry. Yet my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) in
his report-and it is its main feature-states
we were simply net in a position to test the
Canadian Pacifie figures because our conmittee did net get the vital information that
was necessary, and when we asked for means
whereby we could get that vital information
we were refused.
I have but one further statement to make
with reference to the first report. I have
examined it with great care. In my opinion
it avoids the main issue as to how economies
can be effected. My honourable friend in his
statement and in the report, notwithstanding
ahl that bas been said, notwithstanding the
views of practically ail the members of the
committee, notwithstanding that Parliament
is charged with the idea that co-operation has
been an absolute failure, still clings to the
hope that large economies can be brought
about by co-operation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When Sir Edward
Beatty puts his heart into it.

MAY 26, 1939
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes; when both
sides put their hearts into it. The trouble
is that neither side will put their heart into it.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Because there is not
the same incentive on the part of both to
co-operate, you have an impossible condition.
You cannot create economies in that way.
Ail my honourable friend does is to express a
pious hope of fulier co-operation. But no
attempt is made to enforce co-operation. 1
should flot say the representatives of the two
railway systems have dawdle& along; undoubtedly they have worked hard; but condi,ions are such that effective co-operation
simply cannot be achieved. That is .my con3idered opinion.
During the course of our inquiry we received
a mass of very interesting evidence. The
witnesses prepared their evidence very carefully, and ail of it, good, bad, and indifferent,
was very helpful to every member of the
committee in getting a fairly comprehensive
grasp of our railway problem.
I want to refer to only two phases of the
evidence, which appealed to me very forcibly.
In my opinion, the most startling evidence
adduced was that relating to the progressively declining earning power of the
railway as a transportation facility, flot only
in Canad-a, 'but elsewhere as well, the world
over. In view of ail that has gone. on during
the past two years, I doubt very much
whether anyone in this Chamber fuily realizes
what is taking place in connection with transportation. It is flot an event, it is a veritaýble
revolution, and it is changing the status of
the railway everywhere. Unless we visualize
that properly we cannot begin to deal with
this problem confronting us, for that revolution is the crux of the whole situation.
So far as I can recaîl, we had no rebuttal
evidence of any consequence-I should like
to be corrected if I arn wrong-indicating
that any new set of conditions which may
prevail in the future, either within or without Canada, would tend to prevent this declining process from continuing, except probably in a temporary and minor way. 1 ask
ail members of the committee: What evidence had we, as a committee, that anything
would occur either in Canada or outside that
would arrest this declining earning power of
the raiLways? I repeat, we had nothing of
any consequence. Some pious hopes were
expressed that good times may return, that
we may have larger crops in the West, that
there may be more wheat to haul, and al
that sort of thiug. This does not get at the
heart of the situation. There is a relentless

.913

force at work, which, year by year, month by
month, day by day, is cutting the very vitals
out of the railways, not only in, Canada but
elsewhere as well.
If this is true, as I believe it is, of the
inevitable, persistent decreasing earning capacity of the railway as a common carrier of
goodis and persons, it is not at ail difficuit to
foresee and forecast the future financial conditions which are certain to continue on an
mncreasing scale to make their appearance in
the operation of our own railway system.
We cannot see anything that is going te
improve the condition at ail, but we do see
everything- that is going to make it worse.
The report of my good friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), as I sec it, simply means.
"Stand stili and do nothing."
This~ new e'conornic condition that exists
in the transportation field as a direct resuit
of the invention and operation of motor-driven)
vehicles is not in any sense a myth or a
fairy tale. It is a hard, substantial fact, the
effects of which are clearly visible and readily
measurabie. It is not guesswork at ail. You
can see the trucks and can count them; you
know what they carry, and you know what
the railways have lost. This is ail easi]y seen
and measured, and you can calculate what the
future possibilities are. Only the other day
1 was reading that in Great Britain at the
present time there are haîf a million trucks
operating against the railways. It does appear
to me that the situation is such as to demand
that with the least possible delay some course
of action be taken, that will have a strong and
effective tendency towards giving our railways a free hand to take part in the struggle
for traffie. I shahl have a littie more to say
about that further on.
Evidence that the fight is on and bas reached
huge proportions exists ail around us, from
coast to coast. 1 necd not dýwell upon that
at ail. Let me give you a very simple illustration which came to my attention. The
other day I asked a member of Parliament,
"How many farmers in your neighbourhood
take their trucks to the coal fields and get
their coal?" The repiy was: "Al-ail for a
distance of anywhere from one hundired to
one hundred and fifty miles around. They
think nothing of that. More than that, where
the coal is visible on the surface they pick it
out of the ground."
But the truck and the bus are not ail that
have to be considered. What does the future
hold in store so far as the air is concerned?
We know what is occurring in the north
country. There is a fleet of aeroplanes carrying thousands of tons of freight into that

area, which has no other means of transportation. In my opinion aeroplanes will mutdtiply and increase; we shall have larger aeroplanes, aeroplanes of greater capacity; and
one of these days they will corne down to
the inhabited areas and cut into the traffic
there.
There is another phase of the truck question. The entire public attitude towards the
trucks is favourable. Nobody wants to do
away 'with them. Not only doce nobody want
to do away with them, but everybody is
desirous that they should ho facilitated. I
rcad oniy yesterday that the province of
Qucbec is proposing to spend $50,000,O00 on

In a word, they were

any time during the period of reorganization
and readjustment raise any serious objection
to or take concerted action against the broad
policy laid down, or the various methods
adopted to work it out.
I think the attitude of the British railway
employees is the correct attitude. Unless the
railway is placed in a position where it can
earn money to hold its employees, those employees are bound to lose out. In this country, apparently, railway labour is taking the
short view; that is, the men regard the
situation from the present-day standpoint. If
they fail to realize the fact that railway employment cannot long continue unless the railway itself is able to pay its employees, they
will find themselves ultimately in an untenable
position.
I do not wish in any way to give advice to
railway men as to what their views should
be. Personally, I have had the greatest difficulty in understanding why railway labour in
this country and in Great Britain should bc
diametrically opposite in their respective
attitudes towards this question.
I think, honourable members, I have said
enougth at this late stage of the debate. I
doubt very nueh whether anything further
can bc said, as the wlole field Pas been pretty
well explored by honourable members who
have already spoken, and I think it is about
time we took a vote.
At six o'clock the Seiate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I desire to make a very brief statement before casting a vote on this amendment. From the standpoint of the whole
people of Canada, and especially from the
standpoint of the taxpayers of Canada, I have
no hesitation whatever in sup.porting the
anendment.
in 1933 I supported the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act, believing that cooperation should first bc given a fair trial. I
did this particularly for the reason that I had
great confidence in the personnel of the Duf
Commission and knew they had made a
very thorough enquiry and a conscientious
report. At this distance I cannot but think
that in somo measure the Duff Commission
were misled. A study of the evidence before
the Senate Raihvay Committee shows that witnesses who made definite representations te the
Duff Commission, as to savings which couldbe
effecteci by co-operation, very suddeny changed
their minds not long after the commission
reported, and from that time on were continuHav.ously pessimistic as to co-operation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

ing listened to nearly all the evidence submitted, I have net the slightest hope of any
practical results in the way, of co-operative
economies. In 1933 I made up my mind that
if the trial then decided upon did not succeed,
there was nothing to do but unify the managements of the roads.
It seems to me the case on behalf of unified
management, as embodied in the amendment,
and based entirely and very thoroughly on
the evidence given before the committee
during the past two sessions, is complete and
unanswerable. As the report of the committee
is circulated and studied Pv the people of
Canada, it is bound te create a lasting impression on thoughtful citizens throughout the
Dominion.
Let me say in this connection that if it
could be truthfully alleged that the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company did not faithfullv
live up te the provisions of the Act of 1933
and make every endeavour to effect co-operative economies, one would net be so ready to
take a sympathetic view of the attitude of
tlat company. However, after having studied
the evidence carefully, I challenge anyonc to
produce from it anything that would support
any other conclusion t han that the Canadian
Pacific officers sincerely tried to make every
possible saving whielh would not unduly
sacrifice the interests of their conpany. Indeed.
it sceemed to nie tiat in that respec tiev were
much freer froin blame than were the officers
of the Canadian National.
Deslpite the testiniony of all the witnesses,
and even despite the efforts of some of his
followers, the leader of the Governnent (Hon.
Mr. Dandirand) has found it impossible to
refrain from constantly suggesting that ceoperation was blocked by the Canadian Pacifie
Railway. The honourable senator from Inkermac (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) openly protested
against Pis leader's draft report to the committee on the ground that it contained a
statement that the Canadian Pacifit had
blocked co-operation, and Pe forced lis leader
to remove tiis suggestion from the report.
Since the wlhole case of the honourable
leader depends on the ability of the Government to obtain co-operation. it may bc well
te consider whether the Canadian National
lias cver shown any inclination to block
co-operation. After all, if the Canadian Pacifie
did block co-operation, it would bc because,
as a private company, it was trying to protect
itself. Any blocking of co-operation on the
part of the Canadian National would be a
refusal by a government department to obey
the orders of Parliament.
It might be interesting to turn to page 198
of the proceedings of 1938, where Mr. S. W.
Fairweather is on record as stating that the

MAY 26, 1939
reason why the Canadian National could not
get on with co-operation in telegraph services
was that the railway company had not been
able to persuade the Montreal Telegraph
Company to make a reasonable arrangement
regarding the lease of the old Montreal Telegraph System to the Canadian National.

Hon. Mr. PARENT:

May I ask the hon-

ourable gentleman where he finds that statement?
I will answer
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
my lionourable friend in a moment.
Hon. Mr. PARENT:
the report.

It

is surely not in

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If my honourable friend gives me a chance, I shall indicate
where the statement is to be found.
Unfortunately for Mr. Fairweather, a few
days afterwards the Montreal Telegraph Company wrote a letter to the committee, which
was read into the record. It will be found
at page 964 of the 1938 proceedings. That
letter clearly indicated that failure to reach
an arrangement over the leased property had
been due, not to any obstruction on the part
of the Montreal Telegraph Company, but to
complete absence of negotiation by the Canadian National with the telegraph company.
From this it would appear that there had
been some neglect, if not blocking, on the
part of the state railway.

In addition, Mr. Fairweather admitted that
the Canadian National had definitely refused
to go ahead with an express merger. It would
be very interesting to the public to know
the true reason why the express or telegraph
services have not beeh merged. Has a merger
been blocked by the Canadian Pacifie, or
by the Canadian National? Here are obvious
instances where co-operative economies may

be quickly

and conveniently

made.

The

honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) suggested that mergers of
services like these should be tried out before
any general scheme of unification was decided
upon. It is most important that blame for
failure to unify either the telegraph or the
express system should be properly allotted,
if the public is to be able to judge what the
chances of making important savings through

co-operation really are.
In answer to my honourable friend from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent), let me say that
the testimony given by Mr. Fairweather with
respect to the Montreal Telegraph Company
may be found at page 198 of the committee's
1938 proceedings. In answer to a question
ha said:

Facing this particular difficulty, and wanting
ta make this economy, negotiations were opened
with the Montreal Telegraph Company ta
acquire their stock. That is, they were informal
negotiations. We just could not get, as the
saying is, to first base. You could not get
anything. They felt they had a good thing.
Here is the letter which the Montreal Telegraph Company wrote to the committee. It
was signed by Mr. H. E. Rawlings, president
of the company, and addressed to the Joint
Chairmen. As I have already said, it is to
be found at page 964 of the 1938 proceedings.
On the afternoon of Friday, April 13, 1934,
following an appointment as to the day and
hour, I was waited on by the Hon. C. P.
Fullerton, in the company of two other gentlemen, for the purpose of his making, without
having given any notice of the motive of his
visit, the unexpected enquiry as to what
proposition the Montreal Telegraph Company
had to make in order to enable the Federal
Government to bring about a consolidation of
the Canadian Pacifia and Canadian National
Telegraph Companies, to which the Montreal
Telegraph Company was an obstacle.
My reply to Hon. Fullerton was that the
Montreal Telegraph Company had no proposition to make but it would be open to receive
one from the Federal Government, relative to
which I would write him after I had conferred
with the Directors of the Company.
Subsequent to a meeting of the Directors
of the Company, held April 19, 1934, at which
the matter was discussed, a letter as per copy
enclosed was addressed to Hon. Fullerton, and
no acknowledgment bas ever been received
from him.
Subsequent to such letter to Hon. Fullerton
an interview took place between Mr. F. K.
Morrow and myself, the essence of which was
submitted to the Board of Directors of this
Company on December 26, 1934, upon which
date I wrote to Mr. Morrow as per copy
attached, accompanied by a memorandum referred to, since when nothing further has been
heard of the matter from him.
I think you will agree that Mr. Fairweather's
testimony is not entirely in accordance with
facts and gives a wrong impression which merits
this correction.
I merely wished to place these facts on the
record, so that persons who desire to make
further reference to what the Senate is doing
on this matter may be equipped with correct
information. I think I have made it perfectly clear to my honourable friend from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent) and to all
other honourable members that the Montreal
Telegraph Company set up no obstacle to the
consolidating of the telegraph companies, and
that there was no fault in this respect on
the part of the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
The Canadian National alone is responsible
for the failure to bring about a consolidation.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: To make myself
clear, I wish to say that the reason I
questioned my honourable friend's statement
was that I misunderstood what be said. He
was quite correct.

SENATE

Hon. J. L. P. ROBICHEAU: Honourable
senators, before this matter is put to a vote,
I should like to make a brief statement as to
my views.
We have bafore us a choice between two
propositions: co-operation, and unification of
management. The first hias been tried for six
years, and no one would even attampt to
contend that it hias proved successful. On the
other hand, ne one denies that unification of
management would effeet great savings. To
argue against this would bceaqual ta contending that a farmer was justified in keeping two horses whan hie had only work enough
for one. llowever, despite ail that is said in
support of unified management, I cannot
bring myseif to beliave it would permanently
.solve our railway problems.
We of the Maritimes are timid with respect
to railway questions. As an jnucemenet te
jain Cenfedoration we were promised a railroad that would carry aur goods to Upper
Canada markets. This promise was fulfilled
in the building of the Intercolonial Railway,
over which wo xvere given rates that made it
possible for us to attain those markets.
Ex'entually the Government xvent into the
railroad business on a larger scale and mergad
the Intercolonial with tbe greater system. As
a resuit the Intercolonial lost its identity,
pledges te the Maritimes wera forgotten and
xve were facad witb prohibitive rates which
defeated ona of the purposes of Confederation.
In Canada we bave tan gavarnments, nine
of which are now angag-ed in business with
truck and bus ownars. Every mile of bardsurface higbhway that is built croates more
competition for aur railways, and tbe time
is net distant whien ail of the paying transportation business will be in tbe hands of the
provincial governments and their asseciates,
for at Ieast aine months of every yaar. But
let us remnember that if we want railways to
operate during the winter we must give tbem
n chance ta live in the summer.
The real railroad situation is, I believe,
mare clearly perceptible in the small provinces
than in the large anas. 1 remember when
the section of the Dominion Atlantic Railway
betwcen Yarmouth and Annapolis Royal,
N.S., (the oldest town i0 Canada), was
.served daily l)y a way-freight fronm each
place, anil special trains had ta be run at
timocs te handie the business. But ail wayfrei-lht services have now been abandoned.
Althoug-h there is ne railroad competition in
this section, the way-freight business is abseiutely dead. W/han the business is aIl gene
it makes ne difference whetber yen co-operate
or uuify railroad lines; the result is the samne
thon. whichevor course you take.
lion. Mr. PARENT.

There is a way in which this Government
can salve the prohlem. They can ask those
provinces where the people insist on having
different kinds of transportation, te contribute
towards making good the railway deficits or
aIse, if ail the present forms of transportation
cannot be afforded, te state whicha should
ha dispensed witb. After ail, while there are
various kinds of transportation, there is but
ona bearer of the country's financial burdenthe taxpayer.
Before subscribing ta any plan for unification
I should like te know on what basis the
Intercolonial Railway would be affectad. We
of the Maritimes still hope it will be operated
on the basis originally promised. If its identity
is te be further bedavilled by any sceme,
I certainly cannet support such a scheme.
I know the presant condition of aur railways is bad. and we cannot look for a remoedy
in ce-oparation. But bad as the condition is,
I would rather face it than start upon a
.iourney whosa end I (annot forosea.
Ilan. R. B. HORNER:
Honourable senaters, before I voe 1 should like ta statc
wbera I stand.
I intend ta support the
amendmant of the honourable senator from
Mentarville (Hon. Mr. Beaulrian). Soe of
the speeches that have beon made in this
dobate gaveo nie the impression that among
inembers of tha comimittoe thero was a
tendency ta regard the managements of bothi
railreads as hoe
ail that could be desired.
A littla spico might be added te aur discussion
if I wcre ta otlar soe criticism. Parhaps I
hia x had mare recent axperienca and parsenal knowledga of railroad mattars than any
other honourable members of the Huse. In
my opinion, bath aur railroads are somewhat
ta blame for the position in which they find
thcmselx os. Certainly the Canadian National,
because of the uncontrolled extravagance in
which it indulg-ed. bas beau ta a large extant
responsible for bringing aboaut the difficulties
now facing bath roads. We have heard con'iidcrable criticismn of the big, expenditura that
is geînig an at Montreal. That is only one
instance. Out in Saskatoon a station is being
built at a coat of $275,000, which is at least
$200,000 mare than is nacessary ta spend on
it. In ana small city the Canadian National
lias a S4,000,000 hotel. That hotel could not
iiesslily ha made ta pay unless the raem
charge was $15 a, day, but the fact is that
antliing more than $2.50 or $3 would ha considercd exorbitant in siich a small place.
On a previohis occasion I referred ta some
instances of Canadian National extravagance
that had coma te my persenal knowledge.
Out in Vancouver thora was a man with a
special privata car who xvas casting the comn-

MÂY 26, 193
pany $40,0O0 a year and in return doing nothing but creating turmoil among the ordinary
workers, many of whomn had long seniority.
It is flot too much to say that he disrupted
the morale of ernployees from the coast right
through to Winnipeg. If it will add a little
more spice to our praceedings, I will say that
his appointment was due purely te Liberal
politics. He spent $4,0O0 of the people's money
on the grounds around bis house. Then there
was a $60,000 man who, sa far as it could be
learned wben the Bennett Government came
into power, was performing no0 service at ahl.
Incredible as it may seem, he was flot doing
a single thing. And another man, who had
a staff to help him, was giving away some
of the Canadian National's property. He
was let out, and certainly it was neyer afterwards suggested that bis services were required.
Thousands of dollars have been tbrown away
to no purpose.
In my opinion the present Government
bave been largely responsible for the position
the Canadian National system is in to-day. I
arn very much disappointed at the attitude
of the honourable leader of the lieuse, because
I tbink it is the duty of the Government to
take appropriate measures to meet the serious
situation that must inevitably confront us
within a short time. Unlike the honourable
member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I
arn not concerned with the wages and hours
of service of -one section of labour only-railroad mren. I arn concerned with the welfare
of labour from one end of Canada to the
other.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: To-day the standard

of pay of railroad men is three or four times
as higli as that of the men who are paying
freight rates. It is of the utmost importance
ta every labouring man in Canada that our
raiIlvay rates should not be increased, but when
I consider the critical condition confronting
us I can come ta only one conclusion: unless
some remedy is applied, by unification or
otherwise, we shahl have to pay higher freight
rates in the near future. It is vitally important to the continued export of the great
produet of the West, wheat, that the present
grain rates should not be raisecL. For this
reason I arn very much concerned thaîk the
Government are taking fia steps to avert a
crisis in the raihway situation, and I shall
support the amendjment.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET: Honourable
members, I desire to justify my vote, but I
shall detain the House for onhy a few minutes.

The ilesson is a great one, caming from the
Throne itself.
I shahl offer but a few observations. Recause
of tbe disastraus resuits af our railway administration the Canadian people are demanding measures of reform; they are insisting upon
the institution of a systema capable of producing
greatly needed economies and protecting tbe
financial integrity of the nation.
Canada is ta-day paying very dearly for the
peculiar railway structure with which she bas
provided herself. Without this railway backbone, however, this country could nat have
survived as an economie entity. It is these
lines of steel which make it possible for the
wheat from the Prairies ta reach the Great
Lakes and the ocean. Our railways are a
primary factor in the unity existing between
East and West, as well as an important link in
the chain of communications between the
countries-of the Commonwealth.
In 1938 the prorogation of Parhiament interrupted the Senate inquiry. But shartly
after the apening of the present session the
cammittee set itsehf ta the task of investigating
the burden laid upon the Dominion treasuîry,
with a view ta seeking appropriate remedies
for this very serions prohlem.
Lawmakers. of Canada, we are called upon ta
soilve a problemn whicb is really world-wide.
The troubles of aur railways have been shared
in recent years by most of the railways of
Europe and Amnerica. I am not as pessimistic
as many Canadians are about the future of our
railways. The advisability of the creation af
the Canadian National system cannot be
judged solely by financial results. In the worde
of Mr. Hungerford, General Manager of the
Canadian National Railways:
The operation of the National system is
Justified by other and better reasons than

that in that respect the Canadian National
Railways,

from being a -menace ta the

continue greatly to contribiite to the devea4>pment of Canada. Such a service more than
makes up for the inadequacy of the system'a

there is aiso a No. 2 Northern tough, wbich
in every respect save moisture is equivalent
to No. 2 Northern.
Apparently, up to a certain period mixing
of ail grades of grain was within the law;
then an agitation arose in the West and
mixing was stopped. Here is the point I want
to be clear on. If I arn wrong I shouid like
to know it. If I arn right in my facts, I
cannot see how the Bill as it stands can be
resisted.
The reason for the objection to mixing is
this. When you mix a small quantity of No.
4 Northern with a good No. 1 grade, although
in the mixture you are able to maintain the
No. 1 grade, you actually have a Iower quality
of the No. 1 grade than you would have if
you had not mixed. You just get to the
minimum required in No. 1 Northern instead
of having something that is better than the
minimum; therefore the average price for No.
1 Northern is not as good as it otherwise
would be, and the farmer suffers accordingly.
I can understand the contention of the farmer
that the benefit of mixing went to the elevator
man, and I shouid be inclined to think that
in many cases, if not always, the farmer
suffered. He said that he suffered because the
quality was reduced by the mixing. Unless
he was right in that, there was no basis
whatever for his dlaim.
Now the Government propose by this

just as good quality and is as readily salable as
if it had a lower moisture content.
If that is so, then 1 cannot see why farmers
would suifer because of the amendment proposed in this Bill. On the contrary, I can
see that the practice which this amendment
seekcs to sanction would lead to a larger
demand for No. 1 Northern tough for purposes
of mixing which. as it has been explained to
me, does not reduce the quality. It bas also
been pointcd out to me that the spread
between No. 1 Northern and No. 1 Northern
tough is now, as a rule, very mueh lcss than
it used to be, the smaller spread being due
to the widcer demand for No. 1 Northern
created by the mixing privilege. If I arn
right on my facts, I can sec no reasonk for
objection to this amendment; on the contrary, it seems to me the ameodment would

on my facts, I should like to be corrected,
because I feel that unless 1 arn convinced they
arc w'rong I should vote for the Bill.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I will try to explain
to the right honourable gentleman where he
is wrong as te flie fact..
Any iiter v.iitell you tiiot -%heiat of flic
hest ( 1 iality is proîluccd by siacking it for
about thrce weelks. By that proess a sliglit
heat is created and the grain acquires a perfect colour. TIhse next best iîîethod is to stook
the whlîat in large stooks and let it cure
naturally.
I was unable to understand why the amendment proposed in thiis Bill was favourcd by
Mr. Ross, the honourable miember who represents Moose Jaw~ in another place,! but as I
wvas coiuing into thic building this evening
tlie ieason suddcnly struck me. It is this.
On the plains out thîcre thc farîners use the
combine, and it is ncarly impossible to get
grain pcrfcfly dry when eut with a combine.
They would get a higlier price for their tough
grain if they werc allowed te mix it with
our grain that is eut in the more expensive
nîaincr. Very often the grain which is eut
with a combine contains tougli kernels, green
kernets, and, other objectionable features.
Only about 10 per cent of tlic Western wheat
crop is cut by the combine, or combination
thresher.
There lias been a lot of discussion about
raising the price of tougb wheat. The sprcad
between No. 1 Northîern tough and No. 1
Northcrn dry wheat, varies from month te
month. from wcck to week, and from day
to day. In a vcry wet year it is impossible
to get your grain dry. For instance, in 1916,
I think it was, wc liad ramn almost cvery day,

\atI am concerned about is that mixing

honeurable gentleman excuse me? I did net
express a view. I simply said that if mixing
wcuîld net reduce tlic quality, fer sclling
purpos:es, I -would support the amendment.
Honourable
Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon.
members who are familiar with the facts will
bc able te judge whether or net the statements contained in the document are correct.

MAY 26, 1939
If they are, we shall then be able to consider
their application to the principle of the
amendment. The statement reads:
In the Act as consolidated in 1930 the mixing
of grain was prohibi-ted in grades No. 1 Hard,
No. 1 Northern, No. 2 Northern and No. 3
Northern at the terminal elevators, and the outturn standard was raised above the incoming
standard. The stipulation was that no grain
other than grain of the saine grade could be
binned with any of the top four grades.
Nothing, however, was placed in the Act in
regard to moisture content. This had always
been handled by the board under regulation,
and neyer shown in the schedules of grades.
The Act of 1930 was therefore open as to
inoisture content: it did flot say that No. 1
Northern 14 per cent moisture and No. 1
Northern 16 per cent moisture could flot be
binned together.
The Board of Grain Commissioners on the
advice of their own chemists, of mill1 chemists,
of the National Research Council, the Associate
Council on Grain Research, and a great number
of practical grain men, decided to allow toug
grain of the grade to be binned with the straigt
grade for the purpose of drying the tou h rain.
Now that the Act is being amended tte goard
have asked to have this practice Iegalized which
has heen carried on for ten years by permission
of the board in the absence of direction under
the Act.
The practical side of this proposition is this:
if tough grain must be artificially dried it costs
five cents per bushel and the grain will probably
lose a grade; in other words, the fariner gets
f rom 8 to 10 cents per bushel less for it. By
allowing the drying of tough wheat by binning
it with the straight grades of the saine rlade,
L.e. No. 1 tough with No. 1 Northern; mo. 2
tough witb No. 2 Northern; No. 3 touh with
No. 3 Northern, the spread in price in e een
the toughs and the straight grades has narrowed
to froin 2j cents per bushel to 1i cents per
bushel, whereas it used to be 8 to 10 cents.
Straiglit grade grain must contain in moisture
not more than 14-4 per cent; tough, 14-4 to
17 per cent; damp, 17 per cent up. This section
of the Act only covers the tough wheat; damp
must be dried artificially.
Evidenct before the Agricultural Committee
of the House of Commons by Mr. Hamilton of
the Board of Grain Commissioners, and by
Mr. R. H. Milliken, representing the three
Western wheat pools, was to the effeet that
there was no complaint whatever in regard to
this practice f rom United Kingdoin buyers or
continental buyers; that the only complaint was
that soine Garnet wheat had been allowed into
No. 3 Northern, which wvas detrimeýntal. This
placing of Garnet in No. 3 Northern has been
stopped by the board. Both these inen stated
that in both the United Kingdom and on the
continent the opinion of all was that Canada's
grain was of the fineet quality and superior to
ahl others.
Australian wheat has a moisture content of
8, 9 and 10 per cent, but does not command as
high a price as Canadian wheat which has a
moisture content of 11, 12, 13 and 14 per
cent.
1 conclude fromn this memorandum that the
practice established by the Board of Grain
Commissioners bas been beneficial to, farmers
of the West. Since 1930 or 1931, when the
regulation was made, farmers who have had
7149"4a"

523

tough grain on their hands have been able
to take advantage of the regulation and get a
higher price. That being the case, it seems
to me that if we rejected the amendient the
Board of Grain Commissioners would feel
that the practice should not be continued and
would cancel the regulation.
Hon, W. M. ASELTINE: In spite of what
bas been said by our two leaders, I fear this
clause will open the door to indiscriminate
mixing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
one grade.

Lt touches only

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In that connection
I would say that I know several prominent
farmers froin Western Canada who have
visited the Old Country and brought back
samples of wheat which had heen sold there
as No. 1 Northern. When those samples were
taken to the elevators back in Saskatchewan,
the operator said that sucb wheat would grade
a poor No. 3. This shows that in spite of our
regulations something is going on with regard
to, mixing which we know nothing about. The
grading is so stiff that it is difficult to get No.
1, but apparently the wheat wbich we el at
the elevators in the West as No. 1 is mixed
with other wbeat before it is sold in the Old
Country, and the mixture would be regarded
here as only No. 3 grade. For that reason I
fear that if we allow this section to pass, we
shaîl be asked next session to extend the
privilege of mixing until the door ie thrown
wide open.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Does the honourable senator think the wheat pools would
support this amendinent if harinful to the
fariner?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The large terminal
elevators at Buffalo and Fort William would
like the amendinent. They would be able to
make money by taking advantage of the
section.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I do not think we
should go contrary to the interests of Western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
Mr. Milliken represented. the three Westeu'k
wheat pools.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The statement which,
the honourable leader of the Governrment lias
juet read, that the fariner might lose a grade
if he had bis wheat dried., proves my argument that the tough grain you dry with your
dry grain is not the quality of the original
dry grain, and you lower the quality of your
No. 1 Hard wheat.

524

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The drying -refers
to the damp wheat.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Certainiy. It would
take the British Army to staff ail the elevators.
The grain is run out of one bin into another,
and this helps to dry it if it is a littie tough.
But the proposed section would extend the
privilege to the terminal elevators, and that
I arn opposed to. I would flot give thema this
loophole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is oniy
one thing I should like to have cleared Up.
I want to know whetber No. 1 Northern wheat
witb 14-4 per cent moisture content wiii sel]
for as much money as No. 1 Northern with
10 per cent moisture content. This memorandum does flot help me in the ieast. To tell
ws that Australian wheat with less moisture
than Canadian wheat seils for less money does
not get us anywhere. The quaiity of our wheat
,is wbolly different from Australian. I was
.assured by Mr. Ross, and I think by another
gentleman, that wbeat with 14-4 per cent
inoisture is just as valuable as that with 10
per cent, and that the moisture content only
affected the keeping quality of wheat while
in transit, especially through the Panama
Canai. If, that is so, I do not see anytbing
wrong in the Bill; but I must say it does not
seem quite naturai that that should be the
case. As the honourable senator from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donneily) bas said, you
cannot make fleur out of moisture, and one
would think tbat a car of No. 1 Nortbern
wbeat with 10 per cent moisture would seli
for more than a car with 14-4 per cent moisture. I bave ýto be convinced to the contrary
before 1 can support the Bill as it stands.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Another reason
,why farmers are opposed to mixing is that
the terminal elevator companies would make
the profit. When a farmer brings a load of
wheat to the local elevator, if it is graded
tough bie loses right tbere 8 or 10 cents a
bushel on ifs sale fo tbat local elevator. At
the terminal elevator that wbeat would be
mixed witb dry grain, wbicb would improve
its grade, but tbe farmer would not get one
cent extra.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The elevator coinpany would get tbe difference.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Certainly. If the
section specifled the local elevator instead of
£lhe terminal, thon I sbould say the farmer
would watch bis local elevator and get the
adx antage.
Hon. 'Mr. CALDER: Tbis is a somewhat
cornp]icated question, but I do not view the
sifuation as my honourabie friend does. My
Hon.

Mr. HORNER.

understanding is that at the present time, if
wbat we eaul tough No. 1 reaches the market,
the farmer gets the advantage.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:- Anything that is graded
up to No. 1 can bave any content of moisture
up to 14-4 per cent and stili be No. 1. The
price for No. 1 is flxed by the market.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Which would
tbe milier ratber have?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is a question of
milling.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It is important, but not so far as the market price
is coneerned.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, that is where the
importance lies.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But tbere are, so to
speak, grades of grain No. 1 Northern tbat
may bave any moisture content up to 14-4

per cent. Wben that percentage is exceeded
you have toughi No. 1 Nortbern. By practice,
as I understand, not by law, those engaged
in tbe grain trade in Western Canada have
been permitted by tbe Board of Grain Coinmissioners to mix No. 1 tougli with a standard
No. 1. Evcryone in tbe country knows that
is permitted.

Tbe

practice

bas grown

up

under tbe permission of tbe Board of Grain
Commissioners, with the resuit that when
No. 1 tougb reaches the market there is a
spread of only i_ý to 21 cents betwcen it and
No. 1 standard.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Thiat would ail depend
on the quantity of tougb wheat in tbe
country.
Hon. 'Mr. CALDER: Ycs. There might be
a sliglit difference there. The difference would
not ho very great. Those who are in the
trade say, "We bave here a quantity of wheat
with a moisture content of ouly 12 per cent."
Thev are permitted to bave 14-4 per cent
in that and stili eall it No. 1. So they take
a quantity of No. 1 tough and mix it witb
No. 1 standard, and so long as the moisture
content does flot exceed 14-4 per cent tbey
cao seli tbe mixture as No. 1 standard. It
seems to me the farmer gets aIl the hbenefif,
hecause wben be goes to the market .witb bis
wbeat he gets the price of No. 1 standard.
In the old days wben this was not permitted
the farmer got 8 cents a 'bushel iess ail tbrougb
the country.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: He wiil get it again,
too. if thp.re is much tougb wbeat.

MAY 26, 1939
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I canna t see it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let me try ta clear this
up. The price is largely fixed in Liverpool or
London. If we have had good weather it is
known there, and if the grain harvested is
dry the price is on the up-grade. In good
years anybody who bas tough grain gets a
better price, but he gets it at the expense of
the man who bas the very dry grain.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How can that Ibe
avoided?
Hon. Mr. HAIG. The honourable gentle.man fram Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) is
right and wrong, bath at the same time. If
there is not very much tough grain the man
who bas it can make .practically li cents a
'bushel by mixing, and it does not cost him
anything ta do it. But the buyer in Liverpool, knowing that mixing is permitted, will
flot pay as much for No. 1 as if the other
systemn were in effect.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What troubles me is
the fact that the Board of Grain Commissioners have allowed this very thing ta go on.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 know it, but yau cannot
find a farmer in the West who is flot very
much afraid of mîxing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it bas
occurred.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I arn a grain buyer
for a miller in London, and I know that mixing
of any kind is flot allowed in Canada, I will
psy a much better price for the grain than I
would if I knew the elevator company could
mix it so as just ta skin the 14-4 requirement.
The dry grain is better for milling purposes.
Remember, ramn and snow are not the only
things that cause damp grain. We have in
Western Canada a systemn of combining which
was brought in because of the high cast of
labour. Under this system the grain stands in
the field. It may be that a man bas a field
of 160 acres of grain which is flot quite ripe,
but very nearly so. He will go in and cut it
before it is ripe, because it may be hailed out,
or may be blown out by a heavy wind. That
grain is tough, because it is a littie green. It
is put in the stook, where it dries out and
matures.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
How often do
they combine wheat when it is flot fully ripe?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They do it in Manitoba
frequently. The honourable senator cames
from Alberta, where the weather is very dry.
But that is not the real issue. The real point
ià that once the European buyer knows we
shlow mixing, the price of No. 1 goes down.

525

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Mixing has
been gaing on far the last ten or twelve years
under regulation.
Would the honourable
gentleman tell us how it bas worked out?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It bas worked out ta
the advantage of the elevatur campanies and
nobody else. Every farmer in Manitoba will
tell yau that. I can understand Milliken and
bis company being in favour of tbis, but the
ordinary farmer does not want mixing in any
form. I know what I arn talking about, for
I have lived in that country. My fatber
farmed there before me, and I arn now farming myself.
Let us take potatoes as an illustration.
Potatoes are graded. If the mixing of potatocs were allowed you would soon have a
sirnilar protest fromn the producers.
The
honourable senator from Peel (Hait Mr.
Marshall) says what is allowed under this
Bill is flot mixing. But it is the first sign of
mixing.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable gentleman is right as ta bis facts, I
should think every objection which is tenable
in the anc case would be tenable in the other.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: I suggest that
we retura this Bihl ta the Committee on
Banking and Commerce and ask the experts
from the Department of Trade and Commerce or the Board of Grain Commissioners
ta appear and justify this amendment ta the
cornmittee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is that satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: To me it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It seems to
me that on such a matter as this we are
entitlcd ta the best information the Government can give us.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite realize that
conditions may vary from year ta ycar, and

want te register my pretest against the lack
of any provision whereýby senators and other
members ef Parliament who cerne te Ottawa
from distant places might dlaim exemption
on accounit of expenses incurred bere during
the session. This matter is perhaps.not important to anyene living in Ontario or
Quebec, but it is of considerable importance
to those of us who live in the East or the West.
I believe that under the income tax laws of
ail the provinces exemption is allowed for
thezse expenses.

L. Claie Moyer, Esq., K.C.,
Cierk of the Senate,
Ottawa.
Dear Sir:
I have been directed by the House of Cernmens Standing Commîttee on Banking and
Commerce te invite the honourabie members
of the Senate te attend the sittings of the
Committee in cennection with the consideration
of Biii No. 132, an Act te incorperate the
Centrai Mortgage Bank.

MAY 29, 1939
The first sitting of the Oommittee on this
reference ie being held to-day.
If it would facilitate matters, I would be
pleased, with your permission, to place on
the Senate Notice Board advance notices of
the meetings.
Yours respectfully,
R. Arsenault,
Clerk of the Comnmittee.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members have heard the invitation of

the Banking and Commerce Committee of the
House of Commons to members of the Senate
who happen to be free, to attend the hearings
of that committee on the Central Mortgage
Bank Bill. I rnay say it had occurred to me
that considerable information could be gathered
there, and that, if we were not engaged in
comrnittee work of our own, a certain number
of our members might well attend the House
of Commons committee in order to bear the
representations madle. 1 do not know how
long the discussion of the Bill in that committee will take, but it would perbaps be
difficuit in any event for our own committee
to obtain a repetition of that evidence
before prorogation. If the Bill cornes to us,
we shall, of course, take ail the time necessary
for an examination of it, but there wouid be
an advantage in baving certain senators
attend the House of Commons committee and
secure such information as will be given there.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourabie members, this is a quite distinct
departure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
recoilection of any other occasion upon which
this House bas received an invitation to attend
a cornmittee of the Commons. At the
moment I feel disposed to welcome the invitation. Doubtless it is addressed to us at
this tirne with a vicw to reducing to a
minimum the consideration wbich will be
necessary at the bands of our cornrittee,
such action probably being thought necessary
because of the imminence of prorogation.
It is unfortunate the invitation bas been
a-ddressed to us in the midst of the deliherations of tbe Gommons committee. Already
very important witnesses have heen heard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To-day?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I know
the honourwble memiber fromn Winnipeg SouthCentre (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas been attending
the committee-without invitation, I suppose
-and hie bas told me about important
testimony that bas been given. Consequently

529

it wiIl not be as useful to honoursjhle senators
who attend that cornmittee now and try to
kceep up with the evidence. However, I think
our proper attitude would be to welcome the
invitation. That might lead later on. to
consideration of the right of ministers of
eitber House to speak in the other House on
their own measures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wilI send a
request rigbt away to the secretary of the
committee, asking that, if the evidence is
being printed, copies be sent day by day to
bonourable members of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn not objecting to acceptance of the invitation, but I
should like to ask the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) just
wbat position we sbould be in if we did attend
the comrnittee. We should not *be able to
vote there of course. Should we be free to
send the Bill to our own Banking and Comnmerce Commîttee afterwards, if we so desired?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it for
granted that we should be perfectly free to
send the Bill to our own committee, and to
call 'before us the saine parties who give
evidence to the Commons committee, if we
wished to do so. But it would belp us if we
first heard the evidence given over there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
did attend the Commons Committee ail day
to-day. I went tbere and asked tbe chairman
if it was perrnîssible for me to attend. If in
that way I have broken any ru1is of this
House, I apologize to honourable members,
but I must say I did not know of any rule to
prevent my attendance at that comrnittee.
I listened to the evidence and found it very
important. Evidence was given by a representative of the Dominion Mortgage and
Investment Association, wbose mem'bership is
macle up of 51 companies, which have a total

of $581,00,000 on loan in Canada.

He was

on the stand from a quarter after eleven until
one, and from four to six, 'wben the committee
adjourned, to resume at 11.15 to-morrow
rnorning. The Association was asked if it
would furnisb one witness to, speak for life
insurance companies, one for mortgage coinpanies and one for trust companies. The
committee is not calling these people, but wihl
permit thern to give evidence if tbey wish to
do so. I must say that I got a good deal of
useful information at the committee to-day.

SENATE
CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL moved
the second reading of Bill 63, an Act to
amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
He said: Honourable members, after the
motion for second reading is agreed to, T
intend to move that the Bill be referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
in order that the committee may study and
I
report on three proposed amendments.
have received copies of these amendments
from the Law Clerk of the Senate, who has
drafted them in consultation with a solicitor
from the Department of Justice.
The most important amendment has to do
with the definition of "producers" who might
sell wheat to the Wheat Board. In the
Canadian Wheat Board Act they are defined
as persons actually engaged in the production
of wheat or entitled, whether as landlord,
vendor, mortgagee or otherwise by contract
or operation of law, to the wheat grown by a
producer or to any share therein. Persons
who under agreement for sale or mortgage
have an interest in the wheat grown by the
farmer have a right to sell their share thereof.
This Bill does not affect the position of such
persons. It simply provides that the Wheat
Board may advance 70 cents per bushel for
No. 1 Northern. based on Fort William.
The Bill also imposes a limit of 5,000
bushels on the amount which any one farmer,
or mortgagee, or person interested by agreement for sale, and so on, may sell to the
Wheat Board; or rather the board may
advance 70 cents per bushel, for, after all, the
transaction is a sale only if the market price
does not go beyond 70 cents. The producer
gets a participation certificate which entitles
him to anything that the Wheat Board may
be able to realize over and above 70 cents a
bushel on sale of the wheat.
There is also an amendment providing that
the Bill shall come into effect on August 1.
July 31 is the end of the crop year, and if
the Bill became operative before August it
would be tantamount to changing the price
in what is really still the current crop year
I move second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the 5,000bushel limit apply to only one farm a person
may be interested in, or to several?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The 5,000-bushel
limitation applies to any one farming operation, but if a loan company has advanced
money on, say, ten farming operations, then
it will be able to market the wheat it has
collected on each of those farming operations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Where

is

the

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: That is not in the
Bill. It is contained in the amendment which
will be submitted to the Banking and Commerce Committee to-morrow morning. The
honourable member from Winnipeg SouthCentre (Hon. Mr. Haig) referred to it last
Friday when he stated that he had been in
conference with Mr. Euler and that the Law
Clerk of the Senate and a representative from
the Department of Justice would draft the
requisite amendment.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I may say, in answer to the question
from the honourable member from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), that I think the
amendment covers exactly what the honourable senator from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall)
has stated. Before I proceed, I desire to
thank the Hon. Minister of Trade and Commerce for his fairness to me in considering
this amendment. The other amendments are
simply consequential.
I intend now to deal briefly with the wheat
question. I could not be a senator from
Manitoba and not realize that wheat and
other grains are the most important products
of the three Prairie Provinces. I recall that
when in 1917, during the war, the price of
wheat rose to a very high figure, the Government of that day, whether rightly or wrongly,
placed certain restrictions on marketing, and
The
these
were continued until 1921.
farmers of Western Canada still believe that
without those restrictions wheat would have
risen to a very much higher price.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
over all the wheat.

know.

I ought to

Hon. Mr. HAIG: They set a price on the
grain. Many farmers still think that if the
market had been allowed to run free the price
of wheat would have doubled.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend is quite mistaken. The Government did not impose any such price at all.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They controlled
marketing of wheat during that year.

the

board was purchasing wheat for the British

Government.
never fixed the price at all.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Hon. Minister of
Public Works prior to 1917 told me himself
he went te Washington and was advised that
the British Government were purchasing
wheat and the price would be controlled.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Anyone else
could pay more if he wanted te.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the price was controlled by Government interference.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not
interference by our Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, by government, if
you will. Anyway, that was the first time
that the market for wheat was net allowed
to remain free and open.
After that stage the farmers of the
Western Provinces thought that by pooling
their wheat and feeding it out to the market
they could te some extent control the market,
and they formed the famous Wheat Pool.
In 1929 the market partly collapsed, owing
largely to the rise of national self-sufficiency
in Germany, France and Italy, and the
governments of those countries imposed a
high tariff on the importation of wheat. In
1933, the price for No. 1 Northern on the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange reached the lowest
point in forty years. The then Government
to
Bennett Government-arranged
-the
guarantee the banks any advances they might
make to enable the pools to purchase wheat.
This enabled Mr. McFarland, whom the
Government placed in charge of the Wheat
Board, to control the market until November
or December. 1935, when the new Government removed Mr. McFarland and put Mr.
Murray in charge.
In the session of 1935 Parliament passed
the Canadian Wheat Board Act, which fixed
the price of wheat at Fort William at 871
cents a bushel.
The Wheat Board while under Mr. McFarland's control accumulated a large surplus of
wheat. The new Government, fearful of
heavy losses, instructed the Wheat Board,
then under Mr. Murray, te dispose of the
surplus, and the board proceeded to sell for
all it was worth. It made the greatest sale
in December, 1935. But when the business
was wound up the country had suffered no
loss on the wheat purchased in 1933, 1934 and
1935, during the Bennett administration.
Indeed, some persons figure there was a slight
profit on the turnover.

During the general election of 1935 one of
the issues in the rural parts of Western
Canada was what the price of wheat should
be to the farmer. Candidates of the present
Government and their supporters said that
871 cents a bushel was not a fair price, and
advertisements appeared in the Saskatchewan
press urging that it should be at least 10
cents a bushel more.
It may be asked: why did the farmers of
the three Prairies Provinces believe that
statement? Let me tell the House what
happened. By 1937 wheat was selling on the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange at $125 a bushel.
In the spring of 1938, just a year ago, the
present Government of Saskatchewan sold
seed wheat to farmers at $1.45 a bushel. It
will be seen that it was quite natural for the
farmers to believe that 871 cents a bushel was
too low, and that the price should have been
97J cents.
In the fall of 1937 the price ranged from
$125 to $1.30 a bushel, based on Fort
William. When, in the summer of 1938, the
market began to decline, the present Government fixed the price of No. 1 Northern at
80 cents a bushel, based on Fort William,
to come into effect on August 1, 1938. That
is still the price.
In December last Mr. Bracken, Premier
of Manitoba, invited representatives from the
three Prairie Provinces to meet in Winnipeg
to discuss the price of wheat, the cost of production, and so on. After a long conference
it was suggested that the minimum price
ought not to be less than 80 cents a bushel.
During this session the Federal Government
introduced the present Bill, fixing the price
at 60 cents a bushel, but such strong representations were made as to the inadequacy of
this figure that ultimately it was changed to
70 cents.
The farmers of the three Prairie Provinces
are strongly of the opinion that prices they
have had te pay for goods during the last
forty or fifty years, by reason of the tariff
protection enjoyed by the industries of the
two central provinces, were higher than they
would have had to pay in a competitive market.
With the restrictions which Germany, Italy
and France have placed on the importation of
wheat, Western Canada is feeling the pressure
of the economic situation very severely. For
these reasons the farmers of the West contend
that the minimum price of wheat should be at
least 80 cents. They point out that 70 cents
a bushel at Fort William does not mean 70
cents to the wheat producer, because from this
must be deducted the cost of cleaning, elevator
charges, commission, and freight rates, which

532

SENATE

total about 23 cents per bushel. This leaves
an average net price for the different grades of
57 cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Forty-seven cents a
bushel.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct. It would be 47
cents a bushel at 70 cents. I was thinking of
80-cent wheat.
I do not believe the farming communities of
those provinces can grow wheat at 47 cents
a bushel and pay debt charges and taxation
on the land on which it is grown. In this I
am supported by the result of the Bracken Committee's inquiry and by the evidence of the
farmers of that country as to cost of production. There is some evidence to show that
on highly mechanized farms in fine districts
the cost would be lower, but you cannot keep
the farmers on the half-sections if their wheat
is going to pay them only 47 cents a bushel
net. Agitation will continue until that condition is rectified. You may say, "Let them
go into something else." If they do, it will be
a challenge to certain industries in the two
central provinces. Take the dairy industry
for instance. - It may surprise honourable
members to know that Manitoba took more
first prizes for butter than all the rest of
Canada put together.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS:

In Marquette.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not only in Marquette.
There are about twelve creameries there at the
present time.
I want to read a report of interviews with
Mr. Sproule, Vice-President of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and Mr. Hutchinson, the
chairman of the board of the Alberta Wheat
Pool. This report appeared in the Winnipeg
Tribune of about two weeks ago:
Dissatisfaction with the Dominion Government's latest wheat price decision was expressed
to-day by leaders of prairie farm organizations,
who have persisted that the lowest minimum
price acceptable to the farmer was 80 cents a
bushel.
In the House of Commons Thursday night
the Government announced its initial price of
60 cents a bushel had been altered to 70 cents
for the first 5,000 bushels produced by each
farmer, on the basis of No. 1 Northern at Fort
William. At the same time the wheat acreage
bonus allowances were cut.
"We consider that 80 cents was the very
lowest possible amount which could be considered,' said A. F. Sproule, Vice-President of the
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. "In order to pay
all taxes as well as all debts and to meet the
other charges which go to make up the cost
of producing wheat, the Fort William price
would require to be about 25 cents higher on the
average.
"As it is, the debt problem is left in much
the same position as before. Debts will still
remain largely unpaid and they will stay that
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

way until the price of wheat to the farmer rises
substantially or else the cost of the manufactured
goods that he buys comes down just as substantially.
Lew Hutchinson, chairman of the board of
the Alberta Wheat Pool, said the Government's
70-cent figure was "totally inadequate."
"When the Wheat Board took over in 1935
we fought for 95 cents and it was compromised
down to 87j cents under protest," he added.
"In 1938 it was further compromised down to
80 cents under more protest, and now we are
asked to take another 10-cent eut."
"People should understand that 70 cents a
bushel for No. 1 Northern at the terminal means
47 cents a bushel on the average grade of wheat
at the farm," he added.
"Eastern Canada
should understand that most farmers in the
West hardly will make expenses at that price,
even with a fair crop."
Members of the Western markets committee,
headed by Premier John Bracken of Manitoba,
who has urged an 80-cent price at the least,
were silent pending Mr. Bracken's return from
a visit to Northern Manitoba. It is expected
the committee will meet shortly to consider the
Government's latest wheat policy.
John I. McFarland, Calgary, former head of
the Canadian Wheat Board, asked: "Who is to
see there is no 'bootlegging' above the 5,000bushel allotment, and how will it be regulated?"
"How many farmers last year would have
averaged above 5,000 deliveries to the Wheat
Board, and how much wheat would have been
left?" he asked.
"If the surplus over the
stipulated amount were thrown onto the open
market in competition with wheat taken
under the guaranteed price, would it not mean
a greater loss than a fixed price or system
similar te that of the past few years?"
Now I come to a letter published in the
May issue of the Chamber of Commerce
magazine, Canadian Business. I shall read
only part of it. The letter is from the
President of the Alberta Board of Trade and
Agriculture.
I believe your readers in the East should
realize that Western Canada is now facing the
most grave and trying period of its history. To
a degree not prevalent probably elsewhere in the
world, all business and industry of the West
is based on the ability of the grain grower to
exact a price for his product sufficient to afford
a livelihood for himself and those dependent
on him. The findings of the Bracken Conference
last December decisively indicate that no such
price will be available te him until subsidized
production ceases in other countries.
In the absence of such a return for his
labour, the grain grower cannot obtain the
products of other industries nor the services,
professional and otherwise, that are essential
to his welfare. Unless he is afforded an appropriate measure of assistance in the form of
guaranteed cost of production, all secondary
industrial and commercial activities throughout
Western Canada will face near-paralysis. The
disappearance in large measure of the present
quite limited buying and debt-paying power of
all classes in the West, will exert an unfortunate influence on the industrial, financial and
employment situation in Eastern Canada.
The following factors outweigh objections that
naturally might be advanced against the subsidizing of any industry:

533

sold in competition with the highly subsidized
his is parproducts of foreign' countries.
ticularly damaging to the West because its
product is further removed from sea-board than
any other grain producing area of the world
which, to a like extent, depends on export
markets.
2. Western grain is sold on world markets
in competition with the subsidized product of
other countries, while the Canadian producer
is deprived of the' privilege of buying in world
This bears particularly on the
markets.
Western producer because of the freight charge
entering into the Western price of goods manufactured in the East.
3. There is further discrimination arising
f rom the fact that prices are to a certain extent
"pegged" by some statute or authority on almost
every article, commodity, or service, which the
farmer requires, as for example: the fixed and
elevator charge for grain
non-competitive
handling, non-competitive freight rates, artificially sustained wage scales and minimum hours
of labour and minimum wage legislation, ail
of which are reflected in the price of such
finished products as the farmer consumes. Thus
while contributing to a fair standard of living
for others, it is not unfair to expect that others,
through some form of taxation, should contribute to provide a fair standard of living
for the farmer throughout a period such as the
present.
If economic forces throughout the world were
allowed free play, low grain prices would drive
a large percentage of the producers in marginal
areas in certain countries into other pursuits.
Thus the present burdensome surplus would
disappear. But no hope of any such natural
adjustment may be entertained until competing
countries discontinue subsidization. In this connection, however, it must be remembered that
practically no other source of livelihood is available to any appreciable percentage of Western
Canadian grain growers.
Authoritative sources estimate the cost of
wheat production to be 60 cents a bushel. The
present market price at Fort William of
approximately 60 cents basis No. 1 Northern,
when translated into Street prices in Alberta,
means an average price covering all grades of
but approximately 30 cents, or one-half of the
recognized cost of production. It is recalled
that the 1932 crop was marketed at an all-time
low price. but, it is submitted tha-t the resources
of the Western farmer have been so depleted
during the succeeding years, that neither the
grain growing industry of the West, nor those
secondary industries and trades that indirectly
depend on agriculture could again survive a
similar experience. . . .
S. B. Holden,

and Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The guaranteeing of
this price at 47 cents to the farmer, or 70 cents
at Fort William, does not necessarily mean
the price he will get will be as low as that.
He is selling on a free market, is he not?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is a guarantee
by the Government, which appears to be a
valuable consideration. It does not compel
the farmer to take a certain price.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the present price of
October wheat is 66 cents.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: At this time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At this time.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Then the farmer
apparently is getting an advantage of four
cents.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have told you that; but
I have told you also that he is not getting
enough to pay his debts, or pay for services
or goods.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Where are the farmers
getting enough?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They get the
rest under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We are to some extent
in competition with the United States. I have
in my hand a copy of the Journal of Commerce
of Monday, May 22, which gives the price of
wheat. It appears also in the Wall Street
Journal of the same date. In Minneapolis
87 cents is the price of No. 1 Dark Northern
spring wheat, which certainly is not better
than our No. 1 Northern, on which the Fort
William price is 70 cents. I do not think there
is any doubt about this authority. It gives
prices in Kansas City, Omaha, Chicago and
the Gulf ports. I can read it, if you like.
At Minneapolis the price of No. 2 Amber
Durum is 81 cents. I do not know exactly
what our price for Durun is; I think it is

senator from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner) can tell us. I think there is a difference of about 10 cents a bushel between
No. 1 Northern and No. 1 Amber Durum.
An Hon. SENATOR:

It is a little more

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Last year it was about 10
cents. At all events, the Minneapolis price
for No. 1 Dark Northern is 87 cents, and for
No. 2 Durum it is 81 cents. That means, I
suggest, that our price is out of line with the
American price by at least 17 cents a bushel.
My honourable friend fron King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) says that our price is pretty
good; that the farmers are getting 4 cents
over the market at the present time. I want
to say to my honourable friend that unless
the Government come to a realization of

534

the fact that the producers of natural products
are facing collapse under present conditions,
some people who will realize it will be put
ino office.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That means Bolshevismn.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You may have it. My
honourable friend rnay be surprised after the
next electien when he sess the kind of people
who represent Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba. Hie bas had a surprise from Alberta
already.

but Manitoba bad a good crop.

the two present members of Parliament who

surpriscd at what happens in Saskatchewan
and Manitoba. This thing, once it is started,
will not end there. Since 1878 Canada's
National Pelicy bas recognized that certain
industries require assistance by way cf protection; and the sonner we realize that because
of world conditions--nationalistie conditions
in other countries-assistance is required by
the producers cf natural products, the better
it will be for everybedy.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Would you stop with
wheat?

cf natural produets.
lion. Mr. HUGHES: That is the trouble.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 arn net suggesting that
you stop with wheat. If you had neyer
started with wheat it might have been al
right; but in 1933 a start was made, and in
1.935 the Government guaranteed 87j-cent
wheat. If you were a farmer on the plains cf

situation.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: You would follow in

lion. Mr. HAIG: No, I would not follow
in the same direction. We had thought the
situation in Western Canada was only
temporary; that it would straighten out. And

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The people generally
expected that under this year's conditions the

that they will not accept 70 cents. Ail the
leaders in that part of the ceuntry have said
that 80 cents is the minimum that the farmers
cao carry on with. I warn the Government
that if they persist in the 70-cent price they
will ho making a very sad mistake, and when
the election cemes, this year er next year,
they will regret that they did net keop the
prico at 80 cents. If the 80-cent prico permitted the farmers te make a prefit I should

the wheat producers of the West get 80 cents
a bushel at Fort Wil-liam they will flot hbe

I believe that Canada should be self-contained. Our industries require a certain degree
of protection; and in a situation such as we
bave now, where the wheat producers are
unable to seil on the open market at a price
that wnuld enable them ta make a living, I
believe the rest of the people should share
part of the farmer's load by seeing that he
gets at least a fair minimum price-enaugh
ta enable him ta live.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: -I am persuaded that
certain honourable gentlemen in this bouse
would prntest very Ioudly. They are the
senators from Ontario and Quebec. I plead
for the parts of Canada represented by other
senators. I think I speak for the twenty-faur
senators who corne from the Maritimes, which
are largely dependent upon natural products,
and also for the twenty-four senators from the
four Western Provinces, wbich alsa are dependent upon natural products.
Hon. Mr. bORNER: I do nat wish the
honourable gentleman ta include me in that
line of argument.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: *I notice that my honourable friend bas ont gone out on the hustings
and taken the stand ha now takes. If he

535

rest of the country will not give us help when
we need it. there will be a body of opinion
in the West which will say, "Ail right, then
we won't help you when you need help."
That will be an issue in this country. And
woe betide any man who contests a constituency in any of the three Western Provinces
and expresses views contrary ta those 1 have
stated here. I suggest ta my honourable
friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner) that he resign his seat in the Senate
and run as a candidate in Western Canada.
H1e would be overwhelmingly defeated; in
fact, he would ]ose his deposit.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I repeat, we in Manitoba tbink that the minimum price of wheat
should be 80 cents a bushel at Fort William.
And that is only a get-by price. The people
of the West will say, "The Bennett Government protected our market from 1933 ta 1935,
and it should lie protected again." As bonourable members know, the United States and
other large wheat producing countries have a
guaranteed price. In Australia, for instance,
I think the price is about 3s. 2d. 1 plead with
the House to suggest ta the Government that
the price at Fort William sbould be at least
80 cents a bushel.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: bonourable members, I do not intend ta discuss
the principle of fixing a wheat price, or the
sufficiency of the price now fixed, or the
general tariff issue. When the honourable
member from. Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon.
Mr. Haig) forecast that any Governoment
which failed ta fix a fair price for wheat would
suifer the calamity of defeat tbrougbout the
West, I thought bow grateful the late Prime
Minister of this country ought ta be that,
alter having fixed the price at 87J cents for
years, he received such tremendous acclaim
in that part of the country and carried nearly
every seat there!
I rise ta say very little. My honourable
friend's modern history is good. H1e knows
the West nnw perhaps better than I do, for
he lives there. But his ancient history is not
nearly so gond. If I caught his argument,
it was this. The Western farmer thinks he
suifered from Government in.terference with
wheat prices in the war days, and, resting
upon that grievance, feels there should lie
some compensation nnw. But the fact is that
he did flot suifer the loss of a single nickel
on that account. The Gavernment neyer
interfered ta the extent of ona penny with
wheat prices in war days. Indeed, the Government could not interfere with wheat
prices except by a special statute or by

536

SENATE

action under the War Measures Act of that
rime. War days were an exceptional period.
The ordinary play of mnarkets could net
operate then, because there was only one
possible purchaser. The British Government
were required flot only to do ail the purchasing, but to provide the
necessary
exehange, to cons oy the grain overseas and
aftcrwerds to distribute it among their own
people and the people of their allies. The
British Government, therefore, had a representative in Canada for the buying of
wheat. I was not directly connected with
this, but I do know that the only interest
the Governimcnt of Canada exerted was to
gct the best price they could. Naturelly they
did thet. The British Government had to
determine what was fair, in the cireumstances.
Pressure wes exerted this way and that.
There were certain economir. factors too,
principýAly operating in the United States,
whirh lielped to determine the price. The
more that ivas got, the botter it ivas for the
Canadian fariner and for the Government.
There was ne interference w-ith prices. Anyone who tries to rest a dlaimi upon disappeerance of the market beceuse of interference by the Canadian Government is
simply ignoring whiat actually occrirred.
One other point 1 mighrt mention, though
it does not pertain to the issue. Something
took place which my honourable friend freim
Winnipeg Soutli-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas
epparently overlooked . Atter the disappearance froin the market of the British Government's purchasing organization, the name of
which I cannot remember juîst at the momentHon. Mr. LAMBERT: The Wheat Expert
Company.
iRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: My honourable friend from Winnipeg Soutb-Centre said
that after thet organizetion disappearcd from
the nmarket the Western farmers decided to
handle w heet through a wheat board. He is
far out in his history there. They nex er set
up the Wheat Board. It was the Government
of Canada whio did that, and they did it
largely because, elthough the British Governinenit lîad discontinîîed pîîrchasing, trade
xvas not running in the ordinary chennels,
on account of unusuel exciienge conditions.
Thiere ivas no ineans of financing tlîe purchese
of wheat through individueal lieuses in Canada,
and the Governuient hiad to find some way
out; so we establislhcd by statute, that is,
under thc W/ar Measures Act, the first Wheat
Board of this country. That was not donc
at the instance of the Western farmer.

Hon. Mr. HAIG- True.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do flot
intend to indulge in any boastinýg; likely
others could do that botter. But I may say
I drafted every word of that statute. In its
sehieme of participation certificates, which
appeered there for the first time, the farmer
got a fixed price.

The Wheat Board 'vas established, and the
whole participation certificates plan came into
effect. The Western farmer not only did not
inspire that plan, but hie did nlot receive it
wîth any welcome. In fact, there xves an
uproar against it throughout the xvhole W/est.
I had to go eut to defend myseif against irate
farmiers in Western Canada, including farmers
in my own constituency, and I had a liard

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: -producers

and

were subsequently
developed.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I wish to say just a few words about a matter
raised .by my honourable
friend from
Winnipeg Southi-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)
which real]y wearies me. That is the tariff
question. I arn one of those Western farmers
who fait to see that it would do us any great
good to wreck industries in Eastern Canada.
1 arn interested in marketing the gonds I
produce, and I know that unless there are
successful manufacturing industries in this
country we cannot have a good home market
for our wheat. Any farmer knows that a
manufacturing town is the best market hie
can get.
But I arn not satisfied witli the grain situation that has existed in Western Canada since
1935.
The lionourable gentleman from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) did
not quite explain wliat occurred tha-t year.
The Wheat Board we had were making an
initial payment of f7l cents. The farmers
delivered their wlieat to the board and took
the initial payment.
They were given
participation certificates and believed the
wheat was stili theirs and that they would
have sorne rnoney corning to them in 1936.
But the Government that are responsihle for
the present Bill appointed a new Wheat Board,
wlio decided to get rid of the wheat. They
were going to give it away, you miglit say.
They were seliing it at around 70 to 75 cents.
On the 7th of July, 1936, I went to Calgary,
and I made a statement to the Calgary
Herald. I do not want to .boast, but I perhaps
came dloser to an accurate estimate of the
Western wlieat crop than any other man ever
lias come: my estimate was within 100,000
bushels of the actual crop. I said it was a
crime that the 'board weýre virtually giving
away the wlieat when it should seli for not
less than $1.25 a bushel. After reading my
statement a great rnany farmers refused to
seil their wheat at the ridiculously low price
the hoard were offering; and some of them
not only held their own wheat, *but bought
more on the futures market. I have been
thanked by many people for what I said then.
One man, whom I had neyer met before,
came and shook me 'by the hand and said,
"Well, Horner, if you neyer do another thing
you have already earned ail the saIary you
wîll be paid in the Senate, even if you should
live to lie a hundred." I asked him if lie liad
made some money because of what I liad said,
and hie replied, "Yes, I have made $10,000."
A large number of farmers profited by as

537

mucli as 50 cents a bushel 'by holding their
wheat or purchasing futures at that time.
But between the 7th and the end of July
60,000,000 bushels had been virtually given
away by the Wheat Board.
I sornetimes feel that the greatest enemies
of the Western Canada wheat producers are
the people who go about estimating a surplus.
It is strange how those surpluses disappear,
and sometimes I wonder whether the estimated
surpluses represent actual or merely paper
wheat. A speculator can step into the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and depress the rnarket
by selling $100.000 worth of paper wheat at a
cost of only 10 cents a bushel, but in order
to selI my actual wlieat I have to put up 70
or 80 cents a bushel, for that is my coat of
production.
We have had far too much of this sort of
legisiation. I arn utterly opposed to the
5,000-bushel restriction. I can imagine liow
tliat provision would be evaded by unscrupulous persons dividing their crop arnong their
hired men and their sons and daughters, each
masquerading as, a producer. In addition to
tliose coming under the definition of "producer" you will have to include the individual
farmer who, we will say, raises 5,000 bushels
of wheat on his own farm and is interested in
five other farms which lie lias sold on crop
payrnents.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He would be covered by
the amendrnent.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Then why have the
5,000-bushel limitation at ail? This sort of
legislation penalizes the progressive man. In
the last few years the large farmer is the one
who lias suffered most. He lias gone deeper
into de'bt in order to secure seed and feed.
He is the last man to go on relief. He lias
held on, and now you liamper him witli thîs
special legislation. He will try to do wliat is
right and proper. He will not evade the limitation by dividing up lis crop as the other
fellow will.
I arn sorry to say, in view of what occurred
at the last provincial election, that I fear
polities will enter into this matter. Two
weeks before the election the relief inspectors
were clianged, and the new men went around
the country saying: "The other fellow did not
give you enougli relief. We are going to
give you lots. Sure, thiere wîll lie more money
in circulation, and you should be on relief."
I repeat, this is not the right sort of legislation, and 1 take strong objection to it.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
the course of the discussion leads me to the
opinion that government fixing of tlie price

SEýNATE
of natural commodities is certainly dangerous
if flot deleterjous to business itself. I doubt
the wisdom of centinuing to fix the price of
wheat. Why should we do so? It may be
answered that it is our greatest vrop. But
is it nlot inevitable that if we continue to fix
the price of wheat. we shall have te extend

Lumber.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: From Montreal east,
down tbrough the Maritime Provinces, we
bave two major crops. The first is lumber.
The most rapid spruce growth in Canada is
in that eastern section, and wîth careful conservation we van get a crop of lumber once
evcry twvnty years. We have been told about
the prive spread. of wheat. I remember when
lumber was $5 per thousand superficial feet,
and it lias been as bigli as $45. That is a
far greater spread than bas 'ever occurred in
the price of whcat. Whvn the prive reached
S45 a thousand cverybody in the lumber business imagined lie w-ould be a millionaire
before very long. Fortunately, or unfortunately,
that highi prive clic. not continue. The price
devlined to tlie point where the man who
operaved on bis own land did not get even
the co-st of taking off the lumber, and lumber
men who eut lumber off Government lands
did not get sufficient to pay the cost of
operation and stumpage. The resuit may be
imagined: the lumber business became bankrupt. Those who bad been in the lumber
business for generations were vompelled to
drop out. It may be taken for granted that
if the Governiment continue to bonus wbeat
the people engaged in the lumber business in
Eastern Canada will ask for a similar bonus
on ilii
prodclut. I am quite sure that will
ha'ppen. My only wonder is that suvh a
request wvas not made long ago.
The produetion of potatoes is a vital industry to the farming vommunities of Prince
Edward Island and New Brunswick.
The
price of potatoes bas ranged from 5 cents to
$2.50 a bushel. That is a tremendous spreadfar greater fhan any that bas eccurred in the
prive of wvheait in the Mest. As everyone
knows, potatocs sold at 5 vents a bushel van-

not ceturn a profit to the grower.

Honour-

able senators frein Prince Edward Island know
more about potato growing than I do, but I
think tbey will agree with me that the farmer

abeve that prive represents profit. But he
must sell bis crop the minute he bas it ready.
If he bas to put the potatoes into bis cellar
and hold thym, the cost of re-picking
necessitates a return of 60 cents a bushel for
him te break even. If hie could be assured
of a fixed prive of 75 vents a bushel in the
faîl of the year be would be well satisfied.
Wben the 'prive soared to $2.10 and $2.50 a
bushel be, toc, had visions of dollars floating
around bim, and lie invreased his avreage.
Wben the collapse came and the market was
glutted he could get notbing for bis crop
and, it rotted on bis hands. If we continue
to bonus wheat, is not the grower of potatoes
and otber products of tbe farm in tbe Mari-

time Provinces and Quebev fully justified in
asking for similar treatment? As a matter of
fact, tbose engaged in growing potatoes bave
" still stronger claim, in that tbe potato is
a perishable produvt.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Wheat van be varried
over, year in and year out, but you cannot
hold potatoes more than six montha, and even
witbin tbree months detarioration begins te
set in, witb tbe vensequent expense of cepicking, and so on. I am net in tbe potato
business, 'but I am in tbe middle of the

potato-growing section of New Brunswick.
I am confident tbat if tbe Goverument continue to bonus wvheat they will bave to vome
to the relief of potato growcrs and farmers
engaged in tbe production of other products
of the soil, or else dissatisfactien will increase
until it reaches such a peint that nobody will
know wbat trouble rnay ensue. I see in this
priee-fixing of wbeat or any other natural
product notbing but danger. I do nlot mean
danger to tbe Government, for, after all,
tbe life of tbis or that government is quite
immaterial le the life of the nation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Your party may he in

affect th,- country. But I do nlot think we
are justified in leaving to those who follow
us problems wbivb tbey will find very burdensome and very difficult to solve.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I was impressed by those
wbo appeaced before our vommittee a few
days ago. The burden cf their evidenve was
that the fixing cf a prive on grain was net
good for tbe grain trade. As I was surprised

a fuller statement, -and be convinced me there

MAY 29, 1939
was a good deal in what he said. I think
it is time we stopped asking the Government to fix a price on wheat unless all farm
products are similarly treated. Coming as I
do from Eastern Canada and knowing the
conditions prevailing there, I have no hesitation in saying that if this practice continues
we shall come ta Parliament and insist that
we get a guaranteed price for our potatoes,
.ur lumber and our fish. Let us have less
interference with business and more encouragement for industry. Then Canada will be
better off.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
members, the West bas been the best friend
that the East could possibly have. When the
people of Western Canada had good crops
they spent their money liberally on manufactured goode from the two central provinces.
But for the last eight years conditions in the
West have been abnormal. The country bas
been afflicted with grasshoppers, rust and other
pests. I represent a district that is engaged
mainly in the growing of coarse grains. The
farmers there do not grow much wheat, and
therefore there is not so much trouble in that
district.
I do abject ta the collection of 1 cent a
bushel on all grains, the inadequate fixed price
of 70 cents and the limitation to 5,000 bushels.
That is a small quantity of grain for any one
man ta deliver. I recall that when I was a
member of the other House the Government
guaranteed the wheat growers a minimum
price of 87½ cents a bushel, though wheat
was worth only from 35 ta 40 cents at Fort
William. The Wheat Board accumulated a
surplus of 200,000,000 bushels. A howl went
up that the country was ruined. But the
far-sighted man who at that time administered
the affairs of the nation saw that the markets
were advancing, and he held that wheat. Then
the other party came into power and, without
studying conditions in other countries, they
budgeted for a loss of $15,000,000. Let me
tell honourable memibers that 80 cents a
bushel is none too much for the purpose of
helping the situation in Western Canada.
It will give the farmer, the country merchant
and others a chance ta get back on their feet.
Conditions are against the poor fellow who
is struggling out in the West, and my
sympathies go out ta him. -1 have said in the
other House and in this, and I repeat it now,
a farmer who is a one-crop man will never be
a success.
An Hon. SENATOR: What about live
stock?
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: I am not going ta
tal'k about live stock. I have spoken in
support of it in both Houses, but the live

539

stock industry has never had many friends in
Parliament. It has always been legislated
against and has never had a chance. The man
on the land must farm the way the Almighty
intended him ta: he must engage in mixed
farming. If he engages in the production of
only one crop, he cannot expect ta be
successful.
I suggest that the Government reconsider
the Bill and give the wheat grower this year
a fixed price of 80 cents a bushel, sa as ta help
him towards recovery.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I suppose anything we do will not help one
way or the other in changing the price to be
paid for wheat. It strikes me that this whole
situation grows out of a world situation. I
thoroughly agree with what the honourable
member from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
bas said, that the sooner we get away from
this fixing of prices the better. Nevertheless
we must recognize this world situation. Take
cotton and coffee for instance: thousands of
bales of cotton have been burned and
thousands of bags of coffee have been dumped
into the sea, simply because, as a result of a
world condition, they were not salable. Al
the governments in Europe are subsidizing
their people ta induce them ta grow grain.
This condition is due ta the desire of those
governments to make their nations self-sustaining in case of war.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Even in Great Britain
the Government are subsidizing their people
ta encourage them ta do certain things in
the matter of production until world conditions become normal again and trade follows
the old channels. That is the sort of thing
we shall have to contend with; I am afraid
we cannot avoid it. The real point at issue
is that whether it is the milk man, the cattle
man, the wheat man or the fish man who is
concerned, we must provide a means whereby
he can live.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is a fish Bill ta
came in a day or two.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I dare say. If world
conditions continue as they are, I am afraid
we shall have this and like problems on our
hands for a long time ta come.
There is no use in my discussing the wheat
situation in the West. Everybody knows
what it is. We cannot alter it. I should like
ta see the Western farmer get enough for
him ta pay his operating expenses and have
a little over for his taxes and his debts. Unless
he does, we shall continue ta pour money
into the Western country in other ways.

SENATE
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, thore is one point which I expected
would be raised this eveoing, and, as it bias
ot been mcntioned, I shall take a few
moments of your time to discuss it.
In my opinion this Bill was nlot oecessary
at aIl. Why should we need legisiation fixing
the initial price of wheat when there is
already in existence a Wheat Board which bias
powcr at the beginning of any crop year to
fix an initial price per bushel for wheat?
Under the Act of 1935 this board consisted
of three menîbers and ani advisory council of,
I think, seven. In 1936 the Government
made the mistake of doing away with the
advisory
council; ooveî'theless the board
reinained, and it still lias power te fix, if
ntc~.r.the price of wheat. Whv. then. do
the Cex ernment briog in a Bill of this
nature? Next Augnst. after having given due
consideration to world conditions and the
prico of wheat, the board would have ail the
power oecessary to say whether the price
should ho fixed at 70 cents, 80 cents, 87J
cents, oi, any other figure it deermed proper.
I was glad indeed that the righlt honourable
the leader on this side of the House (Right
Hon. Mr Meig-hon) gave an explanation with
regard to what happenied in 1917 and 1918. It
is the opinion of the farmers of Western
Canada that the Wheat Board was broug-ht
into being in the later years of the war for
the purpose of preventing the price of wbeat
from going too high. Those people now
argue that there is no reason why, cither
throughi the Wheat Board or by regulation,
prices should not be kept froin going too low.
I say I arn glad the righit honourabl gentleman gave his explanation, because thore is
nîistnderstanding in the M'est. I trust the
oewspapers wvi1h give bis staternent full
publicity.
I agree to a greater or less extent witb
wbat was said by the honourable senator
from Winnipeg Southi-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the honourable senator from Saskatchewan
North (Hon. Mr. Horner). Like the hionourablo senator from Saskatchewan North, I
bave no
objection to the industries of
Eastern Canada being protected by a reasonable tariff. It is my experience that the
cbang-ing of tbe tariff by 10 or 15 per cent
does flot mnake one bit of difference in tbe
cost of the article involved. For instance,
the duty on farrn macbinery was reduced te 7ý
per cent by the present Government, but
that reduction did not reduce the cost to us
of farrn implements. As a mnatter of fact, it
is higlier than ever before. Tbe same tbing
bappened in relation to binder twine: the
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

duty wvas taken off entirely, but the cost of
binder twine did not go down; if anything it
went up.
Hon. Mr. HOR'NER: It went down for one
year, long enough to put our manufacturers
out of business, and then it went up.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: After the Canadian
iranufacturers ceased making it, the price
wvent up. And that is the sort of thing that
would happen if xve took the duty off farm
implemnicts or anything else.
We are not objecting to induistry being
protected to a reasonable extent. Vie do flot
mmid paying a little more for otîr automobiles,
our farîn rachinerv or other nîanufactuired
goods. Vie want Eastern Canada to be prosperou,. but we also want son-cthing whichi will
heolp lis te pay our debts.
A statemcent ývas made in another 1place flot
long ago regarding the cost of proclucing
wlheat. It was said that it had been proven
lime and again that wheat could ho grown in
Wesfern Canada at from 30 te 40 cents a
l)ushel. I tako exception te that statement.
1 de net think for a moment that wbeat can
be growo at tîtat price. The statement wvas
nlot chear as te whether the price mentioned
was f.e.h. Fort William, Vancouîver or elsewhere. If the price were 40 cents .o.b. Fort
William. 20 cents would have te be taken off
that, and ooly 20 cents wouild bo left for, the
je uducer. He cannt cuontinue to grow wheat
at thiat price. It is true that en a highly
miechanized faim, where you have a Diesel
tracter that will ploughi an acre at a cost of
onilv a few cents for fuel, drills that will sow
one hundrcd acres a day, and other machinery
ef the same class, you can grow whcat at
a lower price than on a smaller faim; but te,
cquip a farrm te grow xvhcat at a very low
cost requires at least S10,000 capital for the
purchase of machincry, an(l vcry few farmers
mn Westecrn Canada cao afford to make the
investment. Se I say wheat canoot be grown
for 30 centsoru 40 cents a bu.hel , neither
cao it bc groun for 50 cents or 60 cents, and
I do net think it can be grown for 80 cents.
Take the situation that existed hast Lall.
From aIl appearances I hiad a good crop, but
wlien the rust came and the grasshoppers were
througli witb the crop, the wheat was graded
No. 5 Special. If it had been graded No. 1,
I might have made some mooey. Nearly all
the wheat in our area gýraded No. 5 and
some of it went for feed. Vie got 30 or 40
cents a bushel. nnd ne one in Western Canada
can grew wheat at that price and pay his
debts.

of famiiy concern, and in the end the man
and woman on the farrn are in many cases
better off, and live a better kind of life, than
people who make money faster in some other
way, whether 'by reason of high tariffs or
other schemes devised by governments.
This Bill does flot set a fixed price for
wbeat; it provides for the minimum prioe.
Men know that if wbeat fails below that price
they can stili get tbat price, and get it in
cash, and that if the price goes up tbey will
get the balance.
The honourable senator from Marquette
(Hon. Mr. Mullins) spoke of 1 cent a bushel
being collected. It is not 1 cent, but 1 per
cent, which is a good deal less. This is
collected for the purpose of paying the acreage
bonus to the poor farmer who bas been eaten
up by grasshoppers or dried out by bot winds,
and who bas practically no crop at ail. It
would be very fine if we could make the price
of wheat higher than it is.
We are told what will bappen to any government tbat pass legisiation of this kind.
Well, if it happens, it will just bappen. I do
not know that a goverfiment should pass
legisiation simply on the ground that it is
popular. Tbe fact tbat a man is likely to

FISHERIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend
the Fisheries Act, 1932.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the object of
this Bill is to make a very slighit amendment
to the Fisheries Act of 1932. Paragraph (b)
of section 57 of the Act provides for the
payment of compensation by people who build
or place in rivers obstructions which prevent
fish from ascending or dcscending. When the
law was enacted the intention was, I understand, that an annual sum should ýbe paid by
these people. To-day the contention is made
that the Act may be complied with iby payment of one lump sum. The purpose of this
measure is to correct that interpretation.
The Bill would repeal paragraph (b) of
section 57, which rcads:
Every owner or occupier of a slide, dam or
other obstruction across or in any stream,(b) Where the Minister determines that the
provision of an effective fishway or canal
around the slide, dam or other obstruction is
not feasible, or that the spawning areas above
such slide, dam or other obstruction are
destroyed, who after thirty days' notice in writing, neglects or refuses to pay the Minister
such sum or sums of money as he may require
to construct, operate and maintain such comnplete hatchery establishment as will in the
opinion of the Minister meet the requirements
for maintaining the annual return of migratory
fish;
shall be hiable to a penalty of not less than
four dollars and flot more than twenty dollars
for each day or part of a day during which
such notice is flot complied with.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

This is to be replaced by section 57A, reading
as follows:
57A. (1) Where the Mînister determines that
the provision which hie deems necessary for the
public interest, of an efficient fishway or canal
around any slide, dam or other obstruction, is
nut feasible or that the spawning areas above
such slide, dam or other obstruction are
destroyed by reason of any sucb obstruction,
the owner or occupier of any such shide, dam
or other obstruction shaîl f rom time to time pay
to the Receiver General such lump sum or
annual sum of money as may be assessed against
him by the Minister for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining such coinplete hatchery establishment as will, in the
opinion of the Minister, meet the requirements
for mnaintaining the annual return of migratory
fish.
(2) Such lump sum or annual sum shahl be
payable at sucb tinie or times as the Minister
may direct and may be sued for and recovered
with full costs of suit in the Excbequer Court
of Canada.
As paragraph (b) of section 57 now reads,
the Minister is required to fix a sum or sums
of money to be payable by the owner or
occupier of a slide, dam or other obstruction.
There is no authority to require an annual
payment for the maintenance of a hatchcry
establishment.
The proposed amcndment is
intended to give the necessary authority to
assess the owner for the payment of a lump
or aninual sum to operate and maintain such
complete hatchery establishment as wihl, in
the Minister's opinion, meet the requirements
for maintaining the annual return of migratory
fish.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, this Bill provides that anyone wlio
blocks the passage of f3sh in a stream may be
required to make compensation to tbe Minister
by annual payments instead of by one comnplete payment, and it is intended to make
clear that this is wbat the Act always meant.
The amendmcnt is a very minor one. A Bill
of this kind could safely go through a village

ta that part, its facilities sbauld be used
fer more extensively than they are. Last
year only some one or two million bushels
were shipped there. Even if the use of the
Churchill route would mean e saving of only
six cents a bushel an starage, the elevators
there should be filled up ehl winter and the
wheat shipped out the following spring.
I wish ta move in ameadment, seconded by
the hanourable senetar fromn Digby-Clare
MHon. Mr. Robicheau), that this Bill as
amended by the committee be flot now read
a third time, but that it be further amended
by the insertion of the word "Churchill"
after the words "Port Arthur," in peragrapli 3.

Before aur committee this morning Mr. MeIvor explained thet the price at Fart William
w-as high enough ta absorb the difference
between the two rates, thus making it more
profitable for the Wheat Board ta scîl the
shipment et Fort William and still give the
fermer the advantage of the Vencouver rate.
We were told there is no0 market for wheat et
Churchill and na speciel freight rate, and consequently there is fia possibility af securing
et that point a price high enough ta take cere
of the differential. Some day there may be
wheat buyers et Churchill, though it must be

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How mucb
is to be borrowed under tbis Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This Bill gîves
authority to the Governor in Council to borrow a sum nlot exceeding $750,000,000, for the
purposes set out in clause 2 of the Bill. The
principal and intere-st of the boan are to be
a charge upon and payable out of the Consoli,dated Revenue Fund. The Bill is in the
same terms and for the same amount as The
Loan Act, 1936.
My right honourable frie-nd knows that
authority is given to the Gove-rnment from
year to year to borrow money for the purpose
of meeting maturîties and votes of money
macle directly by Parliamnent.
Clause 2 of
,the Bill re-ads as follows:

545

The Governor in Council may, in addition
to the sums now remaiin
unborrowed and
negotiable of the loans aubrzc
y Parliament by any Act heretofore passec, raise by
way of boan, under tbe provisions of The
Consolidated Revenue and Audit Ae-t, 1931, ýby
the issue and sale or pledge of securities of
Canada, in sucb form, f or sucb separate oums,
at such rate of interest and upon suoh other
terms and conditions -as the Governor in Council
may approve, sue-h sum or sums of money as
may be re-quired, not to exceed in the whole
the sum of seven hundred and fifty million
dollars, for paying or redeeming the whole or
any portion of boans or obligations of Canada,
and also for purcbasing and withdrawing f romn
circulation fromn time to time unmatured se-eunitics of Canada, and for public works and general purposes.
Clause 3 reads:
The principal raised by way of boan under
this Ac-t and the interest thereon sb.all be a
charge upon and payable ont of the ConsoIidated Revenue Fund.
This measure, whicb is almost a perennial,
is a general authorization to the Governor in
Council to me-et the obligations of the Governme-nt from year to year, as well as liabilities which follow tbe voting of divers smm
by Parliament. There are some ye-ars when,
be-cause bundreds of millions have be-en voted
in a lump sum, no sncb Bill is presented.

will be, 1 think, no undue de-lay. I sbonld
like honourable members te refle-et on the
significance of the Bill, and I hope the honourable se-nator fromn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) will be pre-sent whe-n it comes up,

SALT FISII BOARD BILL

Hon. RAOUL DANDIJRAND moved the
sûcou(i reading of Bill 130, an Act to provide
for the constitution of a Sait Fish Board.
He said: Honourabie senators, the object of
this Bill is to 'help a branch of the fishing
industry that bas been totally depressed
owing to conditions over which the Canadian
Parliament has bad no control. The sait fisi
industry, particularly on the Atlantic coast,

MAY 31, 1939
increasingly severe competition the producers
have had to meet from foreign countries.
Before the Great War Europe exported very
littie fish to South America, the West Indies
and the United States, which constituted up
to that time our best and almost exclusive
market. After the war, some countries induced
their peopie to enter the dried fish industry
on a large scale, and public funds were provided to increase production and keep down
the cost of production to individuals.
By the means of subventions, subsidies and
bounties, Norway and Newfoundland have displaced our Canadian product in markets which
were formerly enjoyed by our exporters.
No one in Canada is responsible for the
existence of the present conditions in the sait
fish industry. Nevertheless we have to, meet
a situation in which about twenty thousand
persons have to depend for their livelihood,
and that of their dependents, on the proceeds
of a trade which to-day does no-t return the
cost of production. It may be said that these
twenty thousand Canadians should turn to
some other occupation. But everyone who is
familier with the geography and the economic
conditions of the Atlantic coast knows that
it is impossible to ahsorb that nuniber of
people into industries which do flot exist.
In the localities where these fishermen are
situated, the land is not adaptable to profitable
farming. There are no manufacturing industries
of any kind, and there are no natural industries
that could take care of these people.
For. the last five years the annual returo to
those who have been engaged in the production
of saît fish averaged about $190 to each
fisherman. With no prospect of any immediate
natural improvement, it becomes absolutely
necessary either to place these people on relief
roils, or, tbrough some help, enable them to
derive from their only possible occupation
suflicient to maintain themselves and their
dependents.
Commissions, both federal and provincial,
public bodies, and socially-rninded private individuals, during the last ten years, have investigated these conditions. They have been
almost unanimous in recomrnending that some
help should be given to these people to enabie
them to continue in their present occupation
pending an economic readjustment.
It is intended to constitute a -board made
up of men who have acquired experience in
the saIt fish industry and who will suggest and
bring about improvements in the methods
of preparing the fish for export, and in the
methods of marketing. It is intended to
provide a limited amount of money to enabie
the board to carry on its work and render
sorne assistance to the fishermen who cannot

niake enough out of their industry te take
care of themselves and their dependents. The
adverse conditions which have prevaiied in
the dried and sait .fish ind-ustry have had the
effect of forcing many of the Atlantic fishermen
to turn to the fresh fish business and the
lobster trade. The result bas been te force
returns in these two branches down to unprofitable levels and bring about a general depression
in alI branches of the industry. It is hoped that
by a revival of the dried and saIt fish trade the
pressure on the fresh flsh and lobster trade
will be released. With the expansion of our
markets for fresh flsh, both at home and
abroad, and the expected reduction in the
number of those employed in it, one is justified
in assuming that better conditions will prevail
in the fishing industry and among the fishermen.
Those are the views expressed by the
Minister of Fisheries, who introduced this
Bill in the Flouse of Commons.
The Bill before us constitutes a board ta
bc known as the Salt Fish Board, te consist
of three members appointed by the Governor
in Council. One of the members shall be
appointed chairman and another vice-chairman. The chairman shall preside at meetings
of the board, and, in his absence, the vicechairman. I will read some sections of the Bill:
4. The Board, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, may appoint and employ
such teclinicai or other officers, clerks and
employees as may be necessary for the conduct
of its business and the carrying out of the
provisions of thîs Act.
5. The Board shahl
(a) investigate and report to the Minister
upon the marketing of malt fish in the export
trade and explore ail possibilities of opening
up new marketing outlets;
(b) devise and recommend to the Minister
a plan, or plans, which may be adopted for
the orderly marketing of fish, sait or ta be
salted, with a view to improving conditions and
bringing greater returns to the primary producer
and the exporter;
(c) study and report ta the Minister u±pon the
best methods of preparing sait fish for the
various export markets, ta include,
(i) the manner of curing and packing and
the marking of packages for export;
(à) arrangements for an adequate inspection of sait fis for export, and the supervising of such;
(d) study and recommend ta the Minister
means of insuring the use of a proper grade and
kind of sait for curing the variaus species of fiaI'.
6. The Board may(a) give assistance ta exporters in sucI' formi
and manner and ta sucI' extent as may f rom
time ta time be determined by the Board and
approved by the Governor in Council, provided
that the assistance given ta any exporter during
any marketing season shail flot exceed in value

twenty-five per centum of the value as estimated
or foiund by the Board at the point and time of
export of the fish in respect of which such
assistance is given.
(b) with the approval 6f the Governor in
Council establish by regulation and from time
to time vary the terms and conditions under
which assistance may be given under this
section;
(c) with the approval of the Governor in
Council enter into an agreemenit with any
exporter providing for the sale by the Board,
for such exporter, of fish during any marketing
season.
7. The Governor in Council may authorize the
Minister of Finance to make from time to time
advances to the Board from moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purposes of this
Act, and the Board may expend or administer
for such purposes any sum or sums of money
so received.
The Bill also provides for the appointment
of advixory comittees.
In order to give honourable members an
idea of the cause of the depressed condition
of the salt fislh industry, I ask loave to read
a stateunitt made in Committee of the Whole
of the other House by the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, in response to a request by
Honourable Mr. Caban for information along
tiis line. The Minister said:
As a matter of fact, the difficulties in the
marketing of fish are similar to those we have
experienced and are now experiencing lu conFor
nection w-ith the marketing of wheat.
instance, in some parts of Canada the fishermen
are confined almost entirely te the production
of this one commodity, and they are producing
in excess of what can he consumed in this
country. There is a necessity, therefore, just
as there is in the case of wheat, of finding a
foreign market. And just as in the case of
wheat, we find we are confronted with certain
difficulties, such as those of exchange control
and tariffs, and particularly the difficulty of
very severe competition from other countries.
The honourable member bas asked who our
competitors are, and bas asked me to name our
chief markets. In the past the chief markets
for this kind of fish, or for fish generally, have
been Italy; the West Indies, including Cuba;
Spain, and, particularly, Brazil. Our chief
competitors are Newfouudlaid, Norway and
Iceland. Newfoundland is perhaps as strong a
conpetitor as we have. The people of Newfoundland are almost confined to the production
of one commodity, namely fish, and it is true
that they seeu to be able to provide conpetition by selling their fish at a price lower
than that at which we eau sell. The result is
that we are in keen competition with Newfondffland.
Then, some of those countries are trying to
make barter deals. They are attempting to
exchange their products for the products of
other countries. Canada bas never tried to
enter into barter arrangements. It may become
necessary so to do. NorwNay subsidizes heavily
ber exports of fish. I take it that this Bill
is by way of providing some means of competition with Norwegian and other fish.
Italy and Brazil, to both of which we
formerly sold large quantities of fish, are now
trying to develop their own fish-producing
facilities. The same condition applies to fisi

So far as Brazil is concerned, where we had
perhaps the most valuable market of all, they
have put on a very high tariff against Canadian fish.
I have spoken of some of the difficulties.
The chief of these are the strong competition

and other obstacles which have been placed in

fish went to Italy. That fish was of the finest
quality. But for reasons of their own the

countries-I think probably
Someone may say, "Why not try to make some
sort of trade agreenient with Italy?" May I
point out to the committee that the former
Government was negotiating and had practically
concluded arrangement of the terms of an agreement with Italy. We continued those negotintions; but as honourable members know very
well, certain events made it practically impossible for us to negotiate with Italy. Those
negotiations have not been concluded and are
being resumed. At the same time, here is one
difliculty. Unless by way of trade agreenient
Italy guarantees that she wili make a definite
purchase of our fish, there is not much that
can be done, because there is no private purchaser of fish in Italy. All purchases are under
the control of a board.
I have outlined the problem with the information I had at hand. I would say that we
still have a good market in Cuba. Most of
our market is in western Cuba, although in
that market Newfoundland is now becoming
a strong comipetitor. I believe the eastern end
of Cuba is being supplied by Norway. One
might say, "Well, if you can sell Canadian fish
to western Cuba, why can you not sell it to
eastern Cuba?" I am told Norway happens to
have a particular method of curing fish which
bas special appeal to the people of eastern Cuba.
As I said at the outset, there are in connection
with the preparation of fish many matters with
which I am not familiar, but it will be realized
that there are ways of preparing fish which will
appeal to some groups which have been accustomned to a certain product. I believe the
same is true in Brazil and in other countries.
Then, our market in the British West Indies
is not as good as it was. Newfoundland bas
become a keen competitor. The committee is
aware that we have had a twelve-year trade
agreement with the British West Indies, and
that it will be terminated at the end of this
year. The Goverument bas given notice of the
termuination of the agreement, pending the making
of a new agreement w ith the British West Indies.
We hope to have discussions, beginning perhaps
late in the summer or early in the fail, with
regard to the consummation of a new trade
agreement. I can assure the committee that in
those negotiations the Department of Trade and
Commerce will bear in mind not only the conditions w-ith respect to fish, but those with
respect to all other commodities, and in any
negotiations will dlo everything it can to promote the sale of fish and other commodities.

549

MAY 31, 1939
At one tirne we had a market in Spain for
fish. The reason for the loss of that market
is at once evident. During the Civil War in
Spain very littie could be done by way of
carrying out an exchange of produets. An
additional reason is that some of those countries
have becorne more or less impoverished, and
have not the purchasing power they had before.
In rnany instances they try ta, make barter
arrangements, but, as I said before, Canada lias
flot taken part in those arrangements.
I rnay say the Sait Fish Board, with headquarters at Halifax, will be cornposed of men
who understand the difficulties now canfrontmng fishermen on the Atlantic coast, and it
is hoped the board *will endeavour to get the
fishermen ta adopt a higher standard in the
preparation and curing of fish so as to meet
requirernents of markets in various foreigu
countries, with a view to recapturing the

business we have loat there. As honourable
meimbers are no doubt aware, very littie sait
fish is consumed in Canada, perhaps ninetenths of the produce being exported. The
bulk of the people wbo live an the Atlantic
caast gain their livelihood from the sea. Theirs
is a perilous life. World conditions have
made their economie situation very distressful.
At the priesent time a considerable part of
last year's catch is stili unsold. I arn sure
the country at large will welcome any effort
made by Parliarnent to improve the lot of
aur Atlantic fishermen.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable senators, we have 'been bearing for a
considerable period now of the very discouraging state of the fishermen on the
Atlanti coast, particularly in the province
of Nova Scotia. There can be no doubt at
all that times have been extraordinarily hard
for tbem, and on this account their pligbt
calîs for sympathetic attention by the, whole
Dominion.
I take it that the essence of this Bill, if it
bas essence, is ta grant an export subsidy.
Section 6 provides that the board may, af
course out of funds provided by the Dominion,
grant a subsidy to exporters of saît fish,
"provided that the assistance given ta any
exporter during any marketing season shall
not exceed in value twenty-five per centum
of the value as estîmated or found by the
board at the point and time of export af
the flsh in respect af which such assistance
is given." This is the substance of the
measure. 1 do not now attack the policy.
Certainly the worid to-day is cursed with
subsidies, as it is cursed, witb other things
concerning trade. Subsidizing by one country
invites a similar method of accelerating and
intensifying competition on the part of a
rival, and in the end they get nowhere.
However, we have to meet the conditions

wbich surround us, and at the moment I
cannot suggest any other way of coming to
the rescue of an industry which seerne ta be
wartby of survivai, and of taking care of the
population wbo depend upon it.
What I do question. though, is the establishmnent of a new board. For the life of

be paid out. I do not know that such is the
purpose. It may be the Government intend
to do something of only an ancillary or subsidiary character. Whether they will intentionally postpone application of an effective
remedy or not, I am in no position to say.
I do suggest that the Government, instead of
constituting a board of three persons under
the pay of the treasury to learn something
about the fish business from those who have
been engaged in it all their lives, should direct
their efforts and funds towards a definite policy
of assistance, and start now rather than fritter
away time in alleged investigations and
studies.
I have received strong protests against the
measure from persons engaged in the industry
in British Columbia. I am in no position to
say their protests are parallel to or identical
with the objections I am making. They contend the Bill will be useless. Why it should
be in respect of a bounty I cannot understand. However, I am sure it is the intention of the honourable leader of the House
to refer the Bill to committee, and their protests can thon be considered.
In view of the position of those engaged in
the fishing industry on our Atlantic coast, I
certainly would not stand in the way of
second reading of the measure. And if the
few words I have spoken inspire the Government to more direct and masculine efforts, I
shall be all the more pleased.

their standard of living, which, as my honourable friend knows, is now very low.
Thousands of our fishermen have no access
to markets, as they are without railway
facilities. They must therefore await the
arrival of traders. Under this Bill the board
is authorized to purchase fish direct from the
fishermen.

Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, while I approve the principle of
the Bill, I do not think it will accomplish the
object for which it is presented. The Minister apparently desires to stabilize and regulate the price of fish. I doubt very much
whether the Bill will effect that purpose. It
seems to me that the board should be given
authority to establish a scale of prices to be
paid to the producers-the fishermen. This
measure would not appear to assist those
who do the actual fishing. It will merely
help merchants and exporters, and the poor
fishermen will be left in distress. In a word,
the Bill will not do mucb towards relieving
the situation existing in New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia.

disposal of the board to provide assistance to
unfortunate fishermen. I think that instead
of attempting to carry out the work through
the Departmient of Fisheries here it will be
preferable to have three men of high standing
sitting at Halifax, readily accessible and free
to go about the country for the purpose of
investigating conditions and determining what
measures are necessary to bring about an
improvement.
When the Bill is referred to the Conmittee
on Banking and Commerce I shall ask my
colleagues from the Maritimes to attend and
tell us what is required and in what particulars ihe measure can be made more effective.
I move second reading of the Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the Bill did
not bring about a higlier return to the fishermen, then it would be absolutely useless, but
I think that when the Minister appears before
our Committee on Banking and Commerce
he will be able to establish that an effort will
be made to secure such a return to the producers-the fishermen-as will give them a
fair living, and to a certain degree improve
Rght IIon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not see any such
provision in the Bill. That is my objection.
The board is not given sufficient authority.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the Bill is
found to be deficient in this respect it can
be amended in committee, but I think my
honourable friend will find that the authority
given to the board will enable it to help
directly those who cannot help themselves.
My honourable friend will observe that "exporter" is defined to be "a fisherman or cooperative group of fishermen."
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) asks why the Government do
not lay down a policy and have it carried out
by the departmental organization in Ottawa.
I think the difficulty is far greater than appears
at first sight. For years past boards of trade,
local committees, individuals and newspapers
in the Maritimes have said. "This is a dire
calamity," and they have been racking their
brains to find a solution of the depression in
the fishing industry. It is significant that no
practical suggestion has yet been evolved.

Under this Bill some $800,000 will be at the

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
members, I do net pretend to know a great
deal about our fisheries; as a muatter of fact
my knowledge is limited; but, having for
some years occupied the position of Minister
of Fishieries, I have, while listeingil to the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), pondered how I would act in the
circumstances which he bas outlined were I
again in <barge of the department.

MAY 31, 1939
First of ail, I desire to tell the House that
in the Department of Fisheries there are
many excellent officiais, specialists wbo are
familiar with the various phases of our flshing
industry from one coast to the other. I feel
confident that those men possess full and
complete information regarding markets in
foreign countries, including tbe quantities of
flsb required, the quantities produced by those
countries and the methods of treating the
flsb for those markets, and if I were sending
anybody to make a study of foreign
markets I would make a seleclion from among
those men. On the other hand, if the department bas flot sufficient information, why
should it flot flrst call upon the big fish packers
and dealers to explain the market conditions
of the world? Then, if il should turn out
that Canada is handicapped in thbe curing of
fl5 h, or in some other respect, the department
could take steps to remedy the situation.
But three men are to be appointed, and,
they are to 'be paid salaries. As my right
honourable leader has pointed out, they are
certainly going 10 travel ail over the world:
they are going to Spain, now that the revolulion is over; they are going bo Italy, to
Norway, to Swecien and to Scotland. 0f what
ben.efit tbis will be to the -fishermen or the
packers of this country 1 cannot see, particularly as tbe department already bas in ils
possession much bettier expert information
than 1can be furnished by the three men who
may be on this board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On what text
does my honourable friend base bis statement
that these men will travel aIl aro-und. Europe?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Naturally tbey
would.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say no. That
is sometbing that will be dtisclosed in tbe
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would it not
be natural to conclude tbat these men, after
they are appointed, will 6ay, "We must go
and flnd out about these foreigu marketswby tbey bave been losI, and so on"ý?
If we assume that tbese -men are not going
to travel, what is the use of appointing men
.who do not possess haîf the knowledge whicb
is already in the possession of tbe experts in
tbe Department of Fisheries-?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer to
the bonourable gentleman is Ihat the înquiry
wou]d be conducted around the Atlantic coast,
through contact with the producers, for the
purpose of ascertaining wbat can be done
10 raise the level of production.
The p)ro-

551

ducers know wbo Ibeir competitors are; what
competition they have bo meet in Cuba, for
instance, and why Norwegian flsb gel a
preference. I sbould be most surprised to
learn that tbe board was bo travel ab~out the
world to find out about conditions witb wbich
the departiment is familiar.
Hon. D. 0. L'ESPERANCE: Honourabie
members, I represent a division wbere the
people depend on the flsbing industry for a
living. I tbink, Iberefore, I owe il 10 the
House to say a few words about Ibis Bill.
I am very much of the opinion expressed
by tbe right bonourable gentleman (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), thal the 'board to be
constituted under the Bill will not accomplish
very mucb. I do not know wbat conditions
are in the Maritimes, but 1 know what they
are on the Gaspé coast, where the largest
dealers in cured and dried flsh, Robin, Jones
& Whitman-previously Charles Robin &
Company-have a place of business. When
I was down Ibere last week I learned to my
great surprise that for the first lime in the
last one hundired and fifty years the merchants
had notified the fishermen tbey would not be
buying any flsb Ibis year. Robin, Jones &
Whitman did not go, quite so, far; they said
tbey would decide in July.
In Percé,
whicb some lwenty-flve or flfty years ago was
one of the large flsbing centres, there, is not
a single fisherman to-day. Such a condition
bas neyer existed before.
I amrn ot opposed 10 the Government trying to. remedy tbe situation which exisîs, but
I do not lhink tbe sneans adopted is the
rigbt one. Most of these- boards which are
appointed are simply camouflage to enable
the Minister in charge of a deparîmnent to
avoid doing anything. When a board is
appointed, we bave 10 wait for ils report, and
cannol act until we get il. Meanti-me the
fishermen will starve.
I think the Bill is really intended 10 assist
the sait fish industry, but we cannot take the
position that sait flsb to-day bas any chance
on the market. The people want fresb flsb.
That is one of the reasons wby there is no
market for eured fisb. In view of these circumstances I think the besl thing we could
do would be to try 10 effecl a cbeap means
of transportation for fresh flsb. If you buy
cod-fish steak in Montreal or Quebec you
pay 12, 15 or 20 cents a pound for il, tbougb
the fishermani bas sold il for less t-han a cent
a pound. Wbat is the reason for Ibis discrepancy if il is not the cost of transportation? We sbould endeavour to bring about
cheaper transportation and better marketing
conditions for fresb flsh.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
repeat my statement that the sait fish is
for cxport purposes, flot for domnestic consuimption. My honourabie friend has spoken
of fresh fish. Fresb fish is a perishable product xvbic cannot be kept long. In many
mnstances fishiermen lire in smali villages
wherc there are no cold storage facilities.
Furthermore, the market for fresh fish is in
Canada, and there is al.ready an over-producWe are trying to
tion for that market.
relieve this condition by seeuciog an expert
market for sait fish. The fact that the sait
fish producer, being unable to seli his product,
turned to the fresh fish market, was one of
the reasons wby that market was depressed.
We want to turn the tide of production
towards the export market. If we can do
that, both the sait fisb induistcy and the fresh
fish industcy will benefit. However, ail these
matters can be tbceshed out in committee,
wbece we shall have before us representatives
fromn the Maritime Provinces.
The mnotion xvas .agreed to. and the Bill
was read the second time.

The present Bill, which comes, of course,

MAY 31, 1939
Where it appears to an officer of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police not below the rank

emergency and that in the interest of the
State immediate action is necessary, he may
by a written order under his hand give to
any constable the like authority as may be given
by the warrant of a justice under this section.
The warrant of a justice of the peace
authorizes search and seizure. Under subsection 2 such a warrant may be issued without the interposition of any officer of the
judiciary, upon the sole motion of an officer
of the Mounted Police. It is of course based
on necessity. But if there are any who in

hearts of others. Those who shivered and
felt they were living under tyranny when
section 98 was in effect will, upon reading

those of any "padlock law" or of old section

to congratulate the Government on their

Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On section 4-wrongful communication, etc.,

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, I wonder if subsection 3 of section 4 is
not dangerous. It reads:
If any person receives any secret official code

or having reasonable ground to believe, at the
time when he receives it, that the code word,
pass word, sketch, plan, model, article, note,
document or information is communicated to
him in contravention of this Act, he shall be
guilty of an offence under this Act, unless he
proves that the communication to him of the
code word, pass word, sketch, plan, model,

Just what is meant by "receives"? Secret
official information might be sent by registered mail to an innocent person, who would

could say whether or not he had reasonable
ground to believe, at the time he received the
information, that it was communicated to
him in contravention of this Act? He might
be able to discharge the onus of proving that
the communication was made to him contrary
to his desire, but to do so would no doubt
put him to a great deal of trouble and expense.
He might even be placed under arrest and
have his house searched.

71498-36
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think, honourable senators, that every one of the sections in
this Bill is the result of some actual occurrence, or some oxperience which gives grounds
for fearing the possibility of occurrence. The
-subsection referred to by the honourable
gentleman from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) would cover an incident such as honourable members will recali having read of
about four months ago, when the-diplomatie
bag of the Britishi Minister in Spain was used
by a spy for transmission cf documents to
London. The porters and other officiais who
carried the bag were cf course quite innocent
as to its contents. Similarly, one cf our own
Mountod Police, or any other Canadian
officiaI, might be an innocent party to impropor
transmission of secret matter in a bag or
package that he carrnes from one place to
another. If such a person were arrested, his
defence would be that ho had no knowledge of
the contents of the bag or package, and that
the illegal transport hiad been contrary te his
desire. I believe the section would not be
in the Bill but for some actual occurrence, or
some experience showing the possibility cf a
certain type cf occurrence andl the necessity
of providing against it.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I could understand
the subsection if it rcad 'any officiai person,"
but it says "any porson." Cases of the kind
referred to by the honourablo gentleman from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) are nct the
only cnes covered by this provision. As I said
a moment ago, any person might bo the
innocent recipient of secret information sent
by registored mail. I am not opposed to the
purposes cf this section, nor to those cf the
Bill; 1 arn perfectly in accord with them. I
am simply pointing out what seems te me
a dangerous feature cf this subsection.
Hon. Mn. CRIESBACH: Subsection 4 cf section 3 provides:
A penson shah, unless hie proves the contrarv,
be deemed to have been in communication with
an agent cf a foreigo power if( i) lie has, cither within or without Canada,
visited the address cf an agent of a foreign
power or consorted or associated with such
agent.
I hiad intended moving an amendment to that,
but I find that paragraph (c) cf this subsoction, on page 4 cf the Bill, says:
Any address. -whether within or witýhout
Canada, reasonably suspecteci cf being an
a(i(iess tuo(1 for the roceipt cf communications
intended for an agent cf a foreigo power, or
any address at which such an agent resides.
or to whiei hoe resonts foc the purpose cf
giving or recoiving communications, or at which
lio eiries on any business, shahl ho deemed
te ho the address o)f an agent cf a foreign
po-wern. and communic~ations addressed to such
an adldress to be commnunicat ions with sueh an
agent.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

A spy in a fereign country nover bas
information forwarded te him at bis own
address; ho arranges for what are called "post
offices." A common type cf such "post office"r
is a small shop, say a corner grocery stcre. The
spy makes a few purchases, to get himself
known, and thon says bis busines takes him out
of town a good deal, se that ho bas ne
permanent address, and ho asks permission te
have mail sent to him in care of the shop.
Having secured that permission, ho will give
the address cf the shop te agents whom ho
empîcys te do jobs for him. The storekeeper
will of course ho entirel-y ignorant of the fact
that bis promises are boing used as a "post
cifice" for an enemy cf the State. But if the
authorities traced delivery cf any secret information te suchi promises, the storekeeper
would ho required te prove bis innocence, under
subsection 3 cf section 4, te which my honcurable friend frem Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) is referring.
I nepeat that I believo every section cf
tbis Bihl is meant to cover sosnething that
cithen bas acttîahly occurred or is visualized

Yesterday my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) asked me if expenditures
in relation ta the Montreal terminal appeared
in these figures. I may say that further details
of these items will be found in the explanatory notes ta the Bill, but I would direct
his attention ta the fact that the amount for
(general additions and betterments" includes$2,420,000 for the Montreal terminal development.
The total of $25,821,707 might, hy the issue
of an unguaranteed equipment trust issue, be
reduced ta $6,800,000 under section 30 of the
Canadian National Railways Act. This section provides:
Where Parliament has authorized empenditures on equipment ta the extent of 25 per
cent of the cogt of such equipment, the company may make or cause to ne made one or
more equipment issues for the remaining 75
per cent of such cost.
The following loans were made hy the

Ail these boans have been repaid out of the
proceeds of Dominion guaranteed railway
issues, with the exception of S2.515,731.26.
This remaîns on the books of the Dominion
as an ac-tivýe asset.
The guarantced bonds issued under the 1938
legislation form part of the $50,000,000 issue
dated January 16, 1939. This issue comprised
two securities: $15,000.000 seven-year 241 par
cent bonds. sold at 99, ta yicld 2-40 par cent,
and $35,000,000 twenty-year 3 par cent bonds,
soid at 97.25, ta yicld 3-19 par cent.
Two and three-quarter par cent equipment
trust certificates ta the amount of $7,600,000
weî'e salci at an average cost of 3-08 par cent.
These certificates are payable by annual instalments over a period of fifteen years.
I wauld draw attention ta the fact that
this is simply a Bill ta empower the National
systeni ta borrow money ta meet certain
capital requirements. It bias notbing to do
with the Canadian National budg-et wbich is
pravided for in the railway estimates.
With this explanation, I move second reading, of the Bill.
Right Han. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable membars. this measura is entitled "Canadian National Railways Financing and Guarantee Act," but in reality it is merely a Bill ta
authorize the borrowing of money on the
crcdit of the Dominion of Canada. We proceed ta pay aur deticits and lasses by signing
a new note, and thus enabla certain hanourable members, especially the honourable senator froîin Inkernian (Hon. Mr'. Hugessen), ta

but wa are providing means by wbicb it is

ta give us certain raugh estimates, but notbing
of a detailed, character as ta wherc the money
is finaily going ta land.
The first figure, $8,152,707, represents retirement of rnaturing capital obligations. That is
ail right.
But the second figure. $17.669,000, is not
entitlcd ta the saine commendation. This is
nat for retirements; it is for new invastments.
I gatiier from the explanatory note that it
I do nat underis aIl for new investments.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will give my
right honourable friend the details. As honourable members are proïbably aware, the officiais
of the Canadian National Railway systemi
appear each session before the special railway
comm.ittee of the other House to render an
account of their administration during the last
twelve months and to advise the comxnittee
of the needs of the system for the ensuing
twelve months. Details of the items which
I arn now about to give were exa.mined and
approved by that special railway committee.
By paragraph (b) of section 2 the following
are classed as "authorized expenditures":

shown in the statement. In other words, the
total is not $25,800,000, but 834,500,00.
Perhaps my honourable friend will explain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The total cannot
be more than the $25,800,000 odd whicb the
Bill authorizes. I would direct my honourable
friend's attention te, this proviso in section 2:
Provided, however, that for such purposes
the aggregate principal amoun-t at any one
time outstanding of the securities which the
National Company is bereby authorized to
issue from time to time shall not exceed the
suma of $2i5,821,707, being the total of the items
hereinbefore set out.

Additions and betterments including coordinations and acquisition of real or personal
property, not exceeding ý$17,669,000 estimated
as follows:
General additions and betterments. .$13,854,994

But why is there a debit of 813,000,000 and a

principal amount at any one time outstanding
of the loans whjch the Minuster of Finance
is hereýby authorized to make from time to time
to the National Company shall fot exceed the
sum of $25,821,707.
Advances are nmade periodically te, the railway company for :both deficit and capital
purposes, and are charged tempora-rily to the
deficit appropriation. The amnunts chargeable to capital are later credited to the deficit

appropriation and charged to active assets on
certificates furnighed by the company, the
final certificates for the year being signed by
Messrs. George A. Touche & Company, the

The amnunt of tempnrary boans made in

Section 7 is the sanie as lest year. A general

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. Section 8

guarnnteed bond is-sue have recently been
placed, in the first instance, to the credit of
lhe Minister of Finance in trust for the Canadi.an National Railway Company, with the
Bank of Canada.
Since 1934 thiero have beon refunded matured
or called issues of the Canadien National
Railways to the amount of approximately S210-,
000,000. The annual sav~ings in interest charges
amount 10 npproxirnately 83,280,000.
This
(ahculation allows for the amortizatinn of the
increased debt due 10 certain issues being
called et e prcmniuîn. In addition, certain
issues have matured in the amount of $16,046,000 in 1939, and have been refunded by
teinporary boans from the Dominion. If these
loans are refunded into bong-termi debt by an
issue 10 the public et e cost of, say, 3 per
cent, thora will ha a further saving of about
$150,000.
I do not know that I cen give further details

capital obligations vhich wibb arise in the

LOAN BILL
SECOND

R1EADING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bibl 93, an Act 10 authorize
the reising, by way of boan, of certain sums
of money for the Public Service.
Ha said: ilonourable senators, Ibis Bill
gives authority to the Governor in Council
10 borrow a sum not exceeding $750,000,000,
for the purposes set out in clause 2 of the
Bill. The principal and interest of the boan

MAY 31, 1939
are to be a charge upon and payable out of

559

tion of boans or obligations of Canada, and also
for purchasing and withdrawing f romn circulation froni time ta time unmatured securities
of Canada, and for public works and general
purposes.
There niay be some questions as to what the
words "for public works and general purposes"
comprise. This phrase relates to the fact that
at the end of the year, or during the «year,
there may be a deficit in the amounts voted
hy Parliament for those purposes, and it
empowers the Government to borrow money
to cover the deficit. That is the only addition to the general clause, the meaning of
which is quite dlean.
Between this date and December 31, 1940,
there matures or is callable a total of $719,995,115.33. 1 give the details of that amount:

the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Bill
is in the samne terms and for the same amount
.as The Loan Act, 1936.
The only clause which I should read is
clause 2, which says:
The Governor in Council may, in addition ta
the sumo now remaining unborrowed and
negotiable of the boans auÜthorized by Parliament by any Act heretofore passed, raise by
way of boan, under the provisions of The Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931, by the

The Dominion Govcrnment in 1936 were
authorized
to borrow $750,000,000.
That
amount is practically exhausted, the balance

only $17,371,475.03.
To-day the Government
are without power to meet liabilities such as
1 have described except through this Bill
which. is before you for ratification.
My honourable friand fnom. Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Black) asked me yesterday at
-what rate the Government intended to borrow. 1 have this afternoon mentioned the
rates on borrowings that have taken place lately.
The rates on the last 850,000,000 borrowed
under the Loan Act of 1936 will be an
indication of the present market for our
Canadian securities.
On May 15 lest, a
three-yean boan was taken up et lj par cent,
and on the saine date a nineteen-year boan
'was takan up at 3 per cent. The rate changes

from
what
but I
have

day to day, and it is impossible to say
it wilb be within six months or a year,
hope it will not be above the figure 1
just, indiceted.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I was much intanasted
in the honourable gentleman's statement of
the verious intarest rates payable on the
total of approximately $700,000,000 which
matures or is callable batween now and the
end of 1940. Included in that amount thene
is, I gathar, between $300,000,000 and M40,000,000 on which we are paying three per cent or
more. I feel quita sure the Govannment will
borrow rnonay at a much lower rate and pay
off these obligations.
Very considerable
savings enu be made in this way. I thank
the honourable gentleman for bis explanation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Out of niatunities totalling $564,995,115.33, datails of which

SENATE

I have given. two issues are payable in
London, in sterling. One, of $137,058,841, at
3 per cent, due July 1. 1950, is callable on
six months' notice; the other, for $93,926,666.66, at 4 per cent. due October 1, 1960, is
callable on October 1. 1940. It will be for
the Department of Finance to decide when
it is to the advantage of Canada to call in
these issues.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would not
be so presumptuous as to offer any advice to
the Government about borrowing money.
They have had a long and very intensified
experience, and ought to be experts, or pretty
nearly so, by this time. The merry dance
goes onHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, that
experience has been accumulated from year
to year over a considerable period.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I feel
like repeating the poet's prayer: "Let joy be
unconfined.'
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

GOLD CLAUSES BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 87, an Art resperting Gold Clause Obligations.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: If my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
bas examined tho Bill, I would ask leave to
move second reading now.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

All rigbt.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this measure
is highly teinical. Its purpose is to amend
the Gold Clauses Act of 1937 so as to bring
it into line with a judgment handed down
by the Privy Council last year. When Canada
and other countries went off the gold standard
it was thought that Canadian debtors were
protected against the resultant increase in
the burden of their debts, by the provisions
which prohibited the export of gold and the
melting down of gold coin, and that a failure
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

to pay in gold coin would be only a technical
breach of contract. However. the House of
Lords held that all gold clauses must be construed as gold value clauses. That is, they
were to be construed as imposing on the debtor
the obligation to return in paper currency a
sum equivalent to the value of the fixed
quantity of gold in the open market. That
is the doctrine which the House of Lords
promulgated in certain cases, instances being
Feist v. Société Intercommunale Belge d'Electincité; the King v. International Trustee for
the protection of Bondholders Aktiengesellschaft, and New Brunswick Railway Company v. British and French Trust Corporation, Limited. This last-mentioned case is
the one that specially interests us.
The Gold Clauses Act of 1937 was enacted to eliminate the extra burden imposed
on Canadian debtors, and its constitutional
basis was the jurisdiction of Parliament in
relation to the monetary system and, in parlicular, to head 20 of section 91 of the British
North America Act, that is, legal tender. The
Act attacked the problen in two ways: first,
by provisions concerning tender, and second,
by a publie policy provision. In the New
Brunswick case which I have mentioned the
validity of our Gold Clauses Act was recognized. but certain statements were made by
the judlges which justify the amendment we
now s(eek. They held, inter alia, first, that
tic question of tender was one for the lex
fori. so thiat the tender provisions in the Act
apply only to actions in Canadian courts;
and. second, that the provisions were not so
worded tlat a tender could be made under
them after an obligation had been repudiated,
as hlie creditor's right was then, not an action
to enforce a contract, but one for damages
for breach of contract.
The purpose of this Bill is to remedy the
objections which the House of Lords found in
tc Att of 1937. This Bill does not change
the principle of the Act, nor does it change the
Act itself, except to facilitate resistance to a
lawsuit in which the validity of the Act may
be attahked.
With this explanation I rest the case for
the Governenut, and I suggest that my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
express his views.
I
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
basve studied the Bill as well as I can. It
is one of the rnost technical with which we

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: We struck out
the words "Fort William" and substituted
"Fort William-Port Arthur or Vancouver" in
the first part of section 3 of the Bill, but
omitted to make a consequential change, to

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like to

Committee, when we are discussing the Sait
Fish Board Bill, some official from the Department of Fisheries capable of giving the com-

mittee information as to the comparative
qualities of Norwegian, Icelandie, Newfoundland and Canadian sait cod. In my judgment
quality is a vital factor in the export business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall have
that information available to-xnorrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The department

SALT FISH BOARD BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 130, an Act to provide
for the constitution of a Sait Fish Board.
MOTION FOR THIRD READING-BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, I refrained from discussing this Bill
when it was up for second reading, as I
desired to get information that would likeiy
be available when the Bill was before the
Banking and Commerce Committee. The
committee considered the measure to-day,
and we now have the report.
Personally, I am very much in sympathy
with the main objective at which this Bill
aims, namely, betterment of the men engaged
in the fishing business-the fishermen- particularly in the province of Nova Scotia. I am
well aware, as I have no doubt many honourable members are also, that the fishermen
in that province are in a bad plight, and that

562

SENATE

any beli we can give to them is flot oniy welI
deserved, but very necessary.
The objective, without which this Biii wouid
have no menit at ail, is, as I have said, to put
more money into the pockets of the fishiermen,
the men who go to sea and catch the flsh;
flot intu the pockets of the exporters,
that is, the miercantile ciass, the middlemen.
The fishermen, I understand, are the only
beneficiaries contempiated by this Diii. They
are the only people deserving of consideration.
After litcning carefully to the two honourahle miinisters whlî appeared before our committec this morning-, and also to a prominent
officiai of the Department of Fisheries, I am
convinced that the persons who wili obtain
advantage under this Bill in its present form
are those we eall exporters, that is, those
engaged in the business of exporting. Nobody
appeared before the committee to represent
the fishiermen, but Mr. Smith, of Halifax,
was prcsent. He is an exporter, a business
man, and, I presume, he buys fish from the
fishiermnan. He said the Biii wouid heip a
littie. PresumiabIy hie had in his mind it
wouid hielp the exporter a littie.

mind. Tiiat is the bonus which would be
payable under this Bill. I conchude lie
thouglit, and I arn convinced hie is rigbt, that
wlien the fishierman delivers bis fish to the
middleman, the fishierman wili get the oid

i'ght-ard fliat is my impression after hearing
ivhat was said before che committee-this
Bill shouid be aitered. It shouid provide a
safeguard for the man whio catches tbe flsb,
the man wlio dees the liard work and who in
Nova Scotia, 1 know, is down on bis uppers,
liard up, not able to make a living at present
prices for fish.
I arn going to move, as an amendmnent to
the motion, that the Biii be flot now read a

the Committea on Banking- and Commerce,
wîth instructions f0 amend the came as follows:
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Third, to delete clause 9 of the Bill.

This morning I pointed out to tbe Minister
of National Revenue, wbo was cupporting tbe
Bill. that it was intended to better the conditierqs of the fichermen, and I asked why the
Bili chouid not provide that a fair proportion of the 25 per cent bonus chouhd go into
tbe pocket of the man who caught the flsb. Hie
shook bis bead. Hie did nlot think, that couId
be worked out. Weil, 1 think the subject is
worthy of a littie more concideration to sc
if it cannot ha worked eut, hecause the main
objective of Parliament is to provide for the
fisherman. If there is to ha a 25 per cent
bonus, we ought to know wbether it is going
into the pocket of a middlernan, or wbether
the fisherman is going te get a proportion of
it; and 1 think there is skiii enough in this
Parhiament to contrive words, to ha put into
tbe Biii, whicb wili make certain that the
man who catches the flsb wili get corne of
the meney.
With regard te the other point, the appointment of an officer of the Department of Fisheries as chairman of the board, it seems te
me that requires no argument at ail. If we
have in tbe department a staff of competent
men, as I believe we bave-men wbo understand net oniy, the curing, but aiso the exporting of the flcb-it is far better to bave as
head of this board one of these experienced
men. to confer and consuit and act with tbe
represenfatives of tbe fishermen, than a
green hand who wiii have to hac educated in
thcx.e matters.
Now I corne te the third part of my proposed arnendrnenf, the deletion of section 9.
That section reads:
The Board shahl give affect te any Order in
Council that may be passed with regard to its
work.
Wliat does that mean? It cimpiy means that
if this Dili hecornes iaw if may ha repeaied
hiere at Oftawa any day by an Order in

SENATE

My honouraýble friend bas also rnoved that
clause 9 be struck out. This is the clause:
The Board shail give effect to any Order in
Council that may be passed with regard to its
work.
I find a similar direction in clause il:
The Board may, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, make such regulations as
may be necessary for the operation of this Act
and for carrying out the provisions thereof in
accordance with its intent and meaning.
I shall have to ascertain from the Minister
who had charge of the Bill in the House of
Commons wbat hie thinks of the suggestion.
It is of minor importance, as probably clause
11 is sufficient.
As to the suggestion that the Bill be
arnended so as to ensure that the fisherman
shall not be neglected, I cannot see how hie
could be when the essence of this measure
is to improve bis condition.
In the other House the honourable Minister
of Fisheries stated that a number of fishermen in the Maritimes would soon be on relief
if the industry was not given assistance. This
Bill will render assistance in varions forms.
One bas only to peruse it to sec wbat tbe
Department of Fisberies bas in view. An
educational campaigil will be undertaken to
raise the standard and improve the quality
of the fish in order to make it more acceptable
in the various mnarkets we waat to reach.
There will in consequence be direct contact
witb the fishermen, for tbe fishermen tbemselves generally prepare their fisb for market.
I arn told that the fishermen view witb
considerahie satisfaction the steps wbicb are
ahout to be taken to better their condition.
We do not know how this proposed legislation
will work out. but we hope it will prove beneficial to the class for wbom it is intended. I
believe it was approved hy ail members of
the othcr Huse who represent fishing- districts
in the Maritimes, and I arn sure the Senate
will do well to accept the Bill in its present
form.
I arn not disposed to vote for the amendment unless. before the end of this debate, I
arn furnished with the text of the clauses to
be submitted to the committee. I tbink tbe
Senate is entitled to this information.
Rîght Hon. ARTHIUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, from what I said yesterday,
immediately on the introduction of tbe
measure and before I bad an opportunity to
confer with others, no one could conclude tbat
for my part I was opposed to assistance to

I arn not sure.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If tbey are,
I would support the Bill all tbe more strongly.
As to the principle of assistance, nobody wbo
wants to be fair in tbis famnily of Confederation could take exception ta tbe Government
interesting itself in relieving tbe condition of a section of the population very mucb
distressed througb no fault of tbeir own, and
largely because of unfair competitive metbods
depriving tbem of tbeir export markets. These
unfair metbods consist cbiefly in bonusing, but
I believe other devices are also adopted by
competing countries. We were told to-day,
and I have no reason to douht tbe accuracy of
the statement, that on the part of tbe industry itacîf tbere bas been a lack of efficient
modemn metbods of curing and merchandising; that to sorte extent the responsihility
of the industry bas nlot been fully discbarged.
Lt is not necessary, bowever, to consider tbat
point. Conditions are bad.
One bas onhy
to read the Maritime newspapers to be quite
certain of it. Therefore everybody welcomes
an attempt to produce a remedy.
The bonourable senator from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) bas moved that three features
of the Bill be altered to provide for three
different objectives. I start witb tbe lastand I keep in mmnd wliat the bonourable
leader of the bouse says, that tbe amendment is flot specific enough, and shouhd actuaIly state the provisions whicb it proposes
should be inserted.
The hast amendment
proposed is that clause 9 be deleted. Lt could
flot he more definite. Sbould clause 9 flot be
(leleted? One reads the clause witb amazement. I called the Minister's attention to
it this morning, and ail 1 got in reply was
'Citrried!"
Here is the clause:
Tbe Board shaîl give effect to any Order in
Council that may be passed wîth regard to
its work.
Now, if clause 9 remains, who is to he in
charge of the operation of the board? Wbo
is co he the superintending genius? It is the
Ciovemor in Council. If the board fails in
any way to perform tbis work to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council it can be
ordered to handle it differently, or it can be
ordered to stop altogether. If there is somethîing the Minister or tbe Governor in Council wants to achieve and the board is not

committees composed of a majority of representatives of fishermen-producers if there is

no necessity of the board itself being composed in the samne way. Can anyone answer
that? In the Bihl it is found necessary to
say in advance. and it is declared in a mandatnry form, that on each and every one of
the committees there shall be a majorîty
representing the fishermen-producers. Yet on
the board itself it is not necessary for them

Without question the men are thcre. Then,
why should not some of these men, whom
we know to be qualified, be selccted to do the

can be interpreted in that way. Let us look
at the definition. It says:
"exporter" means a fisherman or co-operative
gronp of fishermen or any other person owning
flsh which is afterwards exported in a salted
state, whether dried, boneless, pickle cured or
otherwise processed.
By a literal interpretation the definition would
include anyone who goes out and catches
fish which afterwards are sold and exported.
My observation would be that it is ridiculous
to cali a man who just fishes an exporter.
"'But." it is said, "we have included the
original producer, and therefore hie may get
something of this 25 per cent which is to be
paid te, the exporter." Let us inquire as to
that. I turn to section 6, on the next page,
which provides:
The Board may(a) give assistance to exporters in such form
and rnanner and to such extent as may froni
tume to time be determined by the Board and
approved by the Governor in Council, provided

566

SENATE

that the assistance given to any exporter during
any marketing season shall not exceed in value
twenty-five per centum of the value as estimated
or found by the Board at the point and time
of expert of the fish in respect of which such
assistance is given.
Will anyone tell me how this clause can
apply to the original producer? The original
producer never has fish at the point and time
of export; therefore he can never, under any
circumstances, get the bonus direct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Unless the board
pays the agent of the fisherman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The board
has no power to pay it to anybody but the
exporter. And who is to value the fish at
the point and time of export? The fisherman
is out. The answer is complete; it is written
right in the terms of the Bill. Under those
teris the fisherman has te depend on the
exporter.
The honourable leader of the Government
asks, "Why do you not word that amendment
specifically?" I can do it, but it would take a
little time. Give the Bill to the committee,
and if the Minister cannot suggest the wording I will undertake to do it for him. In the
strongest way possible I urge the Minister
from Nova Scotia, whom I know very well.
and in whose ability I have a great deal
of confidence, to come back and insert clauses
to provide that the object of the regulations
and conditions attached to the payment shall
be the payment of the money to the fisherman-producer. The Minister could do that;
nobody could do it better.
Then the
principle and purpose of the measure would
be expressed in it for the direction and
guidance of the board. As the Bill is now,
the board need not be guided by that purpose at all. I can easily see the possibility
that under this Bill not a single fisherman
will benefit to the extent of one cent. He
may benefit, but there is no provision that
he must. I apprehend, and I confidently
state, that unless the Bill is amended the
great benefit of the $800,000 voted will go to
the merchandiser.
All we ask is that the Bill be amended
to meet tlse three objections. Surely thcy
are reasonable. Surely the Bill will be far
better administered if what is now proposed
is embodied in it. I plead with the leader
of the Government to permit the Bill to
be returned to the committee, and I promise
there shall be no obstructive delay whatever.
I have had no consultation with anybody
about this. unless the receipt of telegrams
can be called consultation.
I can hardly sit down without making
reference to one incident in this morning's
evidence.
To me it was most amusing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Yesterday I received from the Fisheries Committee of the Lunenburg Board of Trade a
telegram protesting in the most determined
language against this Bill, saying that while
its intent was to belp the industry it was
their considered opinion that in its present
form it would really be detrimental to the
fishermen and disastrous to the general fish
export trade. Honourable members were in
receipt of telegrams from the Halifax Board
of Trade. I do not know that tbey were
exactly the same as the Lunenburg telegram,
but they protested against the Bill and
declared its terms had not been referred to
those persons most directly interested. The
Halifax telegrams also conveyed the information that a man was being sent here to
voice a protest against the measure. The
man arrived this morning-Mr. Fletcher
Smith-and became a witness before the
committee.
His first sentence was an
announcement that. like Saul of Tarsus, le
liad seen the light while on the way and
now le was in favour of the Bill. I asked
him just what it was that had brougbt about
this sudden conversion.
Will honourable
nembers re:lly accept my word when I tell
them that le called attention to section 8,
whuicprovides that with the approval of the
Governor in Council the Salt Fish Board
nay appoint advisory committees. He said:
"I made inquiries and I have found that even
thougi
such
advisorv
committees
are
appoinfed, the board will still be able to ask
other people for advice. Having found that
out, I hive coume to the conclusion that the
Bill would not be disastrous at all."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

He gave an-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I made fun
of that first statement of his, and he saw what
a ridiculous thing it was to address to any
person's intelligence. Then he said, "Well,
we were not satisfied with the provision in
section 6 tbat the assistance given to any
exporter shall net exceed 25 per cent of the
value of the fish, but now we are convinced
that while that may not be enough, it will
net do harm." The inference is that before
le got bere le Lad feared assistance to the
extent of 25 per cent of the value of the fish
would be harmful. Is that explanation any
less ridiculous than the other?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He said it had
been thought the 25 per cent would be insufficient.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And Le told

",Acquisition af securities" is ta provide for
the purchase by the Canadian National Railways, jointly wîtb other railways, of securities
ta be issued by another company; in other
words, an increase in the assets of the Canadian
National Railways. "Retirement of maturing

I think I
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
understand it now. I take it from the memorandum that acquisition of securities, $3,440,000, means acquisition by the Canadian
National Railways Company itself, the parent
company, of the securities of one of its subsidiaries, issued by that subsidiary no doubt
for the purpose of making capital improvements. Therefore we are entitled to know
just what those improvements are and where
they are applied. The honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) gave yesterday the items in
connection with the $13,854,000, of which
$2,000,000 was for that blessed Montreal
terminal.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SALT FISH BOARD BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 130, an Act to provide for the constitution of a Salt Fish Board.
He said: Honourable senators, the Bill
as reported contains certain amendments
embodying the suggestions made yesterday
by the honourable senator from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner).
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I stated yesterday that I was not
roady to concur in sending back the Bill to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
becatuse I had not seen the text of the amendmîents suggested by my honourable friend
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner). I now have
the amendments before me. The principal
one is the insertion of a preamble, setting out
the purpose of the Bill. At the time the
measure was introduced in the other House
the honourable Minister of Fisheries explained
what the purpose was. That vocal expression
bas been crystallized in this preamble, and
to it I have no objection.
The second amendment is to, insert the
words "on such ternis and conditions as may
be deemed necessary to ensure that such assistance reaches the fishermen producers" after
(a) in clause 6. This would make the clause
read:
The Board may(a) on such terms and conditions as may be
deened necessary to ensure that such assistance

reaches the fishermen-prodncers, give assistance

to exporters in such form and manner and to
sucb extent as may from time to time be
determined by the Board and approved by the
Governor in Council, provided that the assistance given to any exporter during any marketing season shall not exceed in value twenty-five

JUNE 2, 1939
per centum of the value as estimated or found
by the Board at the point and time of export
of the fish in respect of which such assistance
is given.
The proposed amendment is not limitative;
it does not specify how the desired end shall
be reached. When the economy of the Bill
is examined it is obvious that no effective
assistance can be given to the fisherman himself unless a market is found for his salt fish,
at a price that will enable him to live. The
words added would cover · all means of so
helping the fishermen, and I have no objection
to this amendment either.
The third amendment would eliminate
clause 9. As I stated yesterday, I do not see
that the clause is absolutely necessary, since
clause 11 effects the same purpose.
But I have some doubt as to the usefulness
of the amendment which would impose upon
the Governor in Council the duty of appointing an officer of the Department of Fisheries
as chairman of the board and the other two
members as representatives of " the fishermenproducers, whether co-operative or other."
I have no doubt that the man selected from
among the staff of the Department of Fisheries
would possess adequate technical knowledge,
but I fear he would nut be in a position to
examine into marketing conditions throughout
the world, and more especially in those
countries from which our salt fish has been
excluded by unfair coropetitive and other
conditions. This restrictive clause might to a
certain extent hamper the Government in
selecting three persons competent not only
to supervise the preparation of fish for divers
markets, 'but also to purchase the product
from our fishermen and see to its distribution.
These purchasing operations may involve
expenditure amounting to thousands of dollars,
apart altogether from the 25 per cent payments provided for in section 6.
With that reservation, I accept the report
of the committee and raise no objection to
the Bill in its amended form.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am very happy that the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has accepted the amendments. I need make no comment on those
to which be wholly agrees. As respects the
provision that the chairman of the proposed
board shall be a member of the staff of the
Department of Fisheries and the other two
representatives of fishermen-producers, if i
were Minister of the department I should
welcome the amendment with acclaim. When
a bill provides for financial assistance spread
over a defined area, it is, I think, the greatest
mistake to place the distribution of that
assistance outside the department and in the

569

hands of local men. The principle is wrong.
The results are always unfortunate. When it
comes to the administration of the Act the
Minister will be very glad that his chief
officer is so close at hand. This will enable
the Minister to watch operations under the
Act and to see that the man administering it
gives primary consideration to the general
interest of the country.
The honourable leader of the Government
fears it may be difficult tu get a man who is
sufficiently acquainted with the business. I
cannot concede that there are not officers in
the department who know a great deal about
it. The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) says this board may be buying
fish and then selling them. There is nothing
in the measure to enable them to do that.
It would be a far less desirable one if it gave
them such power. Subclause (c) of section 6
enables the board to make agreements with
exporters to handle the sale of the product.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

As agents.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As agents
they may do that. The official of the department may not have experience in merchandising, but if the Government do their duty
the other two members of the board will
know about that end of the business; they
will probably have had experience in exporting as well as in purchasing. It is very
important that these men be experienced in
and understand the business of the producer,
and that they be representative of the very
man this Bill is said to be designed to help.
I should have liked the amendments of
yesterday to go further; I should have liked
them to provide for the exercise of some
control over the value on which the 25 per
cent may be paid. It is within the power
of the board, without restriction, to estimate
the value. This is a tremendous power, and
it is the main reason why the head of the
board should be an officer of the department.
I can think of no case in which the link
between the board and the department should
be closer. I refrained from going further with
amendments because the Minister, Mr. Ilsley,
represented that to do so would prevent the
board from making advances to the fishermen,
which he represented to be very essential.
I may have acceded too readily to the representations of the Minister in that regard. I
did so because of my confidence in him.
Until I heard the Minister it seemed to me
the value fixed should be the market value,
that is to say, the price.at which a sale could
be made; but his urging was so earnest that,
wisely or otherwise, I yielded.

Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER: I want to
add just a word or two with respect to what
has 'be-en said by rny honourable friend (Hon.

and employees as may be necessary for the
conduct of its business.
It rnust not be forgotten that we have a
Department of Trade and Commerce, one of
whose particular functions is to seek markets.
I should tako it for granted that in this respect
the board would have the very hearty cooperation of that department.

BANK BlILL
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senaters. we have ecared our Order Paper.
and I understand that the only two Bills to
corne to us from the other House before His
Excellency arrives to givo the Royal Assent
arc the Central Mortgage Bank Bill and the
Supp]v Bill. The Central Mortgage Bank Bill
is now heing diseussed in the othier Huse,
where it hias reached the third reading stage;
so we rnay have it within an hour. I would

ing, if that meets with the approvai of the
Senate, and then decide whether to refer it to
Comnmitteo of the Whole or the Cornmittee
on Banking and Commerce. In the meantime
we might adjourn during pleasure and think
the matter over.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. in view of the great prohability of both blouses seeking early prorogation, it occurs to me that time might be
saved if, even before it reaches us, I were to
take this occasion to advance a littie our consideration of the Central Mortgage Bank Bill.
I have spent the entire day studying this
Bill. Since its introduction in the House of
Commons it bas been rewritten, the rewriting
consisting largely in altoration and much more
careful wording of section 16.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend bas a copy of that before him?
Right bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, 1 have it
ail here.
Assuming that we are to prorogue to-morrow,
I feel worried. to use a common expression,
about this Bill coming to us at this tirne. I
ar not eomplaining of the consideration given
to it in the other bouse. There it bas received
very lengthy consideration in committee and
manifestiy bas been scrutinized pretty carefuliy from the point of view of draftsmanship
and general structure; but it is peculiarly a
measure to whieh a committee of our House
shouid give much tirne and very close attention. I should feel botter throughout the
summer if I knew we had tried to do a real
job in connection with this Bill.
In reading and studying the Bill one cannot
but be impressed by the consideration that
if there ever xvas a mensure respecting which
legai supervision should ho careful, this is one.
The work shouid he thoroughly and well done.
I ar n ot going to take occasion to discuss
the principle or the general plan of this legishation, but I wouhd say that unless the constitu tionai structure is carefully safeguarded,
and the framieg and phrasing of every clause
vcry carefully executed. there xviii ho innurnerable pitfalls for those administering the
measure.
This Bill, as I have said, cornes peculiarly
within the functions of the Sonate, and even
though sorne honourable members rnay deplore
any proposal which might prolong our deliberatîon, I suggest to the leader of the Government that wo shouhd ho truant, to our plain
dut v if we ;Aere to deal with this measure
huîrriedly anci carelessly in the dying hours
ef the session. So important a B1ill should
net (urne te us at this timo. Often we have

JIJNE 2,1939
heard the complaint that something had
reached us at the eleventh hour, but I may
say that very littie which bas corne to us
so late has been of such far-reaching consequence as this measure. Here is legisiation
whieh throws the arms of the Govern-ment
around virtually the w'hole boan and mortgage
structure of Canada, amounting to billions
of dollars, and, in my judgment, opens the
way to assumption by the Dominion of
responsibility for the mortgage debts of the
country. The measure, on its face, involves
an authorized liability, not of $200,000A,0,
but of $400,000,000. It provides for incorporation of a so-called bank-it is really not a
bank-with an autborized capital of $200,000,000, to be subscribed by the Dominion, and
an authorized debenture issue of $200,000,000
more, to be guaranteed by the Dominion.
There at once we envisage a $400,000,000
outlay by this debt-oppressed and barassed
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND: The second
mentioned $200,000,000 would be guananteed
by live assets.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: And therefore, in the words of a beloved colleague of
ours, the incunring of the obligation would
be very easy. Ail we need do is put oun
namne on the back of a note. This countny's
guarantees are just as much part of its debt
as is any othen liabilit.y. The difference is only
a matten of wonds. When we pnoclaim tbat
the amount of oun debt is so much, we perhaps
deceive ourselves and centainly deceive othens,
but we do not alter the fact that oun debts
have to be ýadded to, not. in hundneds of
millions, but in billions, by our guanantees.
There is not a little to be said for the
general scheme of the metbod pnoposed in
this Bill for reducing intenest on fanm. bans.
I said 1 was not going to discuss the principle,
but I will ventune to violate tbat undentaking
to this extent. I very much, question application of the principle to boans on city and
town houses. A wbolly diffenent cincumstance
prevails in relation to fanm boans. A fanm
is a parcel of land out of wbich the occupant
makes bis living: it is bis business premises.
A bouse is different: that is sometbing in
which a man ives; it is one of bis assets;
but he makes no living out of it. Funther,
necessity for attacking the fanm boan situation bas no relation to any connesponding
necessity for attacking tbe bouse boan situation. Why is the fanm boan situation negarded
as emergent? Because, through low pnices,
dnought and othen natural visitations-but
chiefly drought-the fanmer's boans are in
many cases greater than the value of his land.
That development bas corne about through

571

no fault of bis own, and the national interest
is tied up witb enabling him, if be is a fairly
good man, to continue on his land. But the
average housebolden bas been afllicted by
no natural or special economic visitation.
Hon. Mn. DANDURAND: I differ with rny
right honounable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGIEN: I do not
know wbat natunal visitation thene 'bas been.
Grassboppers do not hurt a bousebolder, nor
does dnought.
Hon. Mn. DANDURAND: Thene are other
tbings.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are
some tbings, certainly. I may be living in a
bouse beyond rny means and bave it
montgaged for more than its possible sale pnice;
but that does not warrant îny coming to tbe
Government and saying, "You share hall the
Ioss and let the boan company sbare the
otber haîf, in reducing my montgage to 80
per cent of the value of the bouse." The
State should not be cabled upon to concern
itself about my financial position. I may bave
othen assets than that bouse, but even if I do
not own another dollar it cannot be said that
thene bas been any special economic condition whîch bas placed me, as distinct fnom
otbers, in peculianly unfontunate cincunistances.
The housebolden's position may be difficult;
I do not say it is flot. The position of ahl
sorts and conditions of men is difficult, but the
bouseholden's lot bas not been panticulanly
burdensome. Fnom my way of looking at it,
notbing at ahl bas oecurred that wouild scem to
warrant the Governrnent in giving special belp
ýto a man in a city or rc>untry town wbo is
,carrying aàbeavy bunden in respect of a bouse
propenty. I say, let him book after bimself.
The fanm situation is diffenent, and as a
scheme for generally belping tbe farmer's
mortgage and intenest situation, there is sometbing to be said for this Bill. I would not
stand in tbe way of its passing, if only that
part of oun population were to be assisted.
In my opinion tbe State as a wbole must
recognize that peculiar burdens have fallen
upon tbe farmer in tbe way of extraondinary
economic misfontunes, and, principally, natural
visitations. But that tbe State sbould go
beyond tbat passes my comprebiension, and I
cannot defend it.
Looking at the Bill as a means of giving
assistance to farmers, I question veny mucb
the justification for delegating to the Governor
in Council the making of a wbole series of
veny important definitions, as is done in,
I think, the second last section. It is ahl
nigbt to delegate to the Govennon in Council,
or to a board with the approval of the Gov-

SENATE
ernor in Council, power to make regulations
te carry ont the general effect of a measure.
In that case there are cieariy prescribed limitations to the authority of the Governor in
Council. He cannot in any way ovcrstep
the terms of the statute; he cannot stretch
it nor contract it. But be could if he were
given power to make definitions; indeed he
could virtuaily repeal the Act. The reasen
why this power has been de-iegated to the
Governor in Council, I surmise, is this. The
Bill bas been drafted more or iess hurriediy,
and tihe making of these definitions is s0 very
important t-bat there was a, disinclination to
incur respocsibility for having thcma correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What section?

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was right;
it is the second last section, 31.
For instance, tise Govornor in Council is
te have power by regniation te declare what
an ag-roorîrent for sale is. I should not think
à likeiy that lhe wotild go oer far bvond a
1
sosrnd dlefinition. but. the jntonded dofinition
should hc set eut in the Bill. Then he can
defirso wlrat is mcant by "amount owing on
tise mortgage accotint." He should nlot have
suih powcr. That would enable him te sav
that the ameutnt owing shall or shall net
include ail mianner of tbicgs. If we intend
thiat certain things shaîl or, shal net, be
incliided, we ouglit te say se speciflcally, and
net ipave tisis te ho defined later.
Furtiser, the Governor in Council may
declare by dofinition what the arrears of interest are, wiîat the effective rate of interest is,
and wirat a farmn is. Why, he might define
ail cigiît-by-tec potato patcis te be a farm,
and tisat %vould be valid if we passcd this
usoasuro. Thon ibe may define what a graingrossing fariii is. Imagine wbat nsigbt bo

Covernor in Council would go te any oxtreme,

reports to the Central Mortgage Bank as the
latter may require, the paragraph concludes:
-and any such report may be required by the
Central Mortgage Bank to be certified by the
proper officer of th.e member eompany.
This does not fit into tbe wording of an
agreement. It sbould, I tbink, be reworded
somnewhat like this:
and that it (the member company) will provide, if required by the Central Mortgage Bank,
such c ertificate of its proper officer as the
said Central Mortgýage Bank xnay demand.
It is merely a matter of wording.
I would direct attention to another point.
The new clause 16 empowers member coinpanies te enter into these contractual obligations with the Central Bank. The Dominion cannet s0 empower provinciaily incorporated companies unless by the ternis of
their charter-powers such capacity is specified
or implied.
I sbould like honourabie members te give

We will presumne that the province has repealed its legislation;, then the ban or, if
you will, the exclusion, is lifted, and alI
goes well. But suppose that a year later
the province once more ties up the relationship of debtor and creditor and reduces
interest. Where then is the Central Mortgage
Bank? What happens at that point? "Oh,"
yeu say. 'then we shaîýl put the ban on again."
Ah! but what ahout mortgages already in

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was answered in
committee that the power of disallowance
would be used.

that is about aill that could be done. Otherwise you would tbrow yourselves right into

Hon. M.r. BUJCHANAN: Repeal would
not be forced on tbe province. The province
would accept it voluntarily.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, ne; it
treats ail alike. But it seeks te get rid of
restraint on enterprise and other shackles
placed on tbe relationship of debtors and
creditors by varieus provincial enactmentsand I mîght add, if the honourable members
fromn Prince Edward Island were present, by
our own Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act. That is a very desirable feature. This
Bill provides that a mortgage, boan, trust or
mnsurance company may, by making an agreement in certain ternis wjth the Central
Mortgage Bank, become a member company.
By virtue of its becoming a inember company
it is obliged at once te cancel aIl but two

point is this. Because of the repeal, companies
have in that province reduced their mortgage
interest to 5 per cent, they have eut down
tbe principal and interest arrears to 80 per
cent of the value of the security. Ail that
is done. The companies' rights are limited
and can neyer be restored te their original
status. Tbey have made those adjustments

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: But supposing
a province does that, will flot the companies
from past experience ref.rain from going in
there and making adjustments?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They wili
afterwards; but if the ban is lifted the
adjustments are made automaticalily. We
will say the Act does not apply to Alberta
at present, because the Central Mortgage
Bank certifies that the province bas legislation
which makes the Act inapplicable. Suppose
the province repeals that legislation. The
moment the bank certifies it is repealed, ail
the member companies' mortgages in that
province are adjusted under the terms of
this Act. It would be incredibly uni ust if,
after ail this is done and the price paid,
the province were to be ailowed to go tbrough
the antics whicb Alberta bas gone through
in the 'last few years.
Probabiy I have taken as much time as
1 cao usefuliy empIoy on this subject.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. Go on.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest
that in paragraph (s) of clause 16 the word
"lawful" should lie placed as a qualifying
adjective before the word "charges," about
the middle of the paragraph.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbat is in line 9 on
page 9.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
the printed Bill before me.
The clause to which I referred as purporting to add to the powers of member companies, including companies provincially incorporated, is No. 21:
Any mortgage, loan, trust or insurance company may enter into a membership agreement
under the provisions of this Act notwithstanding anything contained in any law or statute in
relation te any matter within the jurisdiction
of the Parliament of Canada.
This, I submait, does not empower a provincial
company to enter into such agreement unless
it is already so empowered by the terras of its
charter or by provincial law.
A slight revision of clause 20 is necessary.
As varying rates of interest are clearly anticipatcd by the general scheme of the
measure, "rate" in the second line sbould, be
followed hy the words, "or rates."
I bave no justification for going over similar
details at greater ýlength. I asic that particular attention be paid to the major considerations which 1 dealt with first.

farmers who bave suffered from drouglit and

grasshoppers and other pests. But would flot
crop failures also affect pro.perty values in
cities and towns adjacent to the stricken area?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They would

then, why sbould not everybody in this country
seek to help everybody else? In that case
you do not belp anybody.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
The fellow who bappens te have bis debt in
the ferm of a mortgage on a bouse whicb lias
depreciated in value is net one whit more
unfertunate or deserving of assistance than
the fellow wbo owes the bank more than he
can pay. If I have a mortgage for mure than
the security is worth, because I want to "keep
up with the Joneses" in a bouse I should not
live in, am I to be specially helped more than
my brother who owes the bank $15,000 and
whose securities have dwindled to the value
of $10.000? Wby do the Government not
intervene and reduce the bank debt to the
value of the securities and take 20 per cent
off that value?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not a
comparable case. This Bill deals with the
average small nwner, with a city bouse valued
at $7.000 or less, or a double bouse wortb
812,000. It does flot affect the large owner.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Suppose I owe
the bank $7,000, and have security for only
S3,000 ?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: The same principle.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then I sbould
be lielped in similar proportion; or if I owe
txxo banks I ought to ho belped to the extent
of about $10,000. You cannot distinguish.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my right
honourable friend will bear with me for a
moment, we can decide as te wbat this Chamber shoiild do.
The Bill which my rigbt honourable friend

is:

JUNE 3, 1939
The next amendment is to add at the end
of section 19, on page il of the Bill, line 24,
the following words:
except in cases where the debtor lias refused
to agree to the adjustment of the mortgage or
where any other person, whose consent to the
adjustment is necessary, lias refused to consent.
Unless some honourable senator desires me
to read the whole paragraph-and without the
whole paragraph the amendment does flot
mean much-I will dispense.
These, honourable members, are the main
amendments made by the committee.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Hon.
ourable members, the amendments are relatively unimportant and I do flot intend to
launcli a debate upon them, but en the
motion.for thLird reading I shall make some
comments and move an amendment.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: 1 may say
that wben these amendments reach the other
Housc one may bc regarded as controversial.
It is the amendment to sub-paragrapb (i) of
paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of section 16,
cbanging the date for readjustment of farmn
mortgagcs from. January 1, 1939, to January 1,
1938. By this amendment any loans effected
after January 1, 1938, would not.corne under
the operation of the Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: As honourable senators know, under this Bill mortgages are
classified as farmn and non-farm. The amendment to which the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) lias just referred
doca not affect the date for adjustment of
non-.farmmortgages, which is January 1, 1936,
but farm mortgages or agreements for sale
made after January 1, 1938, will not be
adjusted.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Why not leave the
date as originally fixed, 1939?
Hon. Mr. HAIG.- Any farmn lans of importance after January 1, 1938, were made
by the Canada Farm Loan Board. There lias
been very littie company loaning at ail.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: But there would be
a nuxuber of renewals.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They are not affected at
ail. It is new mortgages or agreements for
sale made by the company which are really
affected. In Manitoba especially, and also
in some of the other provinces, the companies
in 1938 sold some land under agreements for
sale. Those cannot be reviewed if this amendment is adopted. I thought that it was
unimportant and that the House of Commons
would raise no objection to it, as tliey miglit
bave bigger matters to consider.
The motion was agreed to.

MOTION FOR THIRD READING-BILL
REFERRED BACK TO GOMMITTEE

Hon. Mr, DANDURAND moved tlie third
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, since I entered into some
premature discussion of this measure yesterday our Committee on Banking and Commerce bas bad two sessions, one until late yesterday afternoon and the other from early
morning until noon to-day. We bave bad the
advantage of having before us tbe Hon. Minister of Finance and as well Dr. Clark, Deputy
Minister of Finance, and we bave beard also
certain opinions expressed by otbers. Ail tbis
bas flot resulted in altering my attitude towards the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, oh.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Debt has
apparently ccased to bave any dread for representatives of the people. 1 can well recali
wben it was regardcd as tbe duty of public
officiais and public men to exercise tbe same
bomely virtues wbich have contributed, and
bave alone contributed, to tbe success of the
citizen in a free country; but that disposition bas faded and faded as debt bas multiplied. As the impossibility of servicing becornes more obvious, debt ceases to bave any
terrors at ail. So we pusb on and on, forgetting that tbere is an abyss, forgetful of
the very plain truth, many times driven home
tbrough tbe pages of bistory, tbat tbese thinga
mean just the same to the nation as to the
individual. Tbe nation has to pay, wbetheF
in tbe purging fires of bankruptcy or in some
otber way, just as tbe individual pays for
living beyond bis means and following courses
wbich are financially unsound.
Debt beyond our ability to service, and at
the same time permit tbe free play and onward march of enterprise, means the end of
the economic State. We are not servicing our
debt to-day; we are just borrowing more to
pay our yearly deficits. The reason we borrow, and borrow easily, is that strictures upon
enterprise are now sucb tbat people are
afraid to place their money elsewbere, and
timidly rush to tbe Government with their
savings, boping tbey may be secure in the
Government's bands. And ail thîs goes on
at the expense of the unfortunate. I woùld
the House could see that it is always at the
cost of poorer people. False policy must

always fail on them first. The precipitation
of unemployment at the bottom of the testtube of our country is just a result of wliat
we are doing. It is the by-product of it ail.
I venture to state that in this mneasure we
are making the wildest plunge yet-$200,000,000 of debentures guaranteed, $200,000,000 of
advances, in order te take off the backs o!
certain of our people and corporations the
penalties of bad judgment or of tlie ordinary
misfortunes of life. If tlie Bill were entitled

"An Act to relieve certain persons and companies fromn the vicissitudes of tLis world,"
it would Le properly named. This it does,
and no more: it relieves themn at the expense
of the State, and by a linge addition to the
deficit, which addition also must be serviced,
because once we cease te service it we are
ever the precipice and in the abyss; and the
cost of servieing means additions to burdens
on industry, and therefore to the army of
unemployed. who must go out of work becanse
industry is flot vigorous and vital and able to
give tbema jobs.
Wlien we become familiar with anythingvery vicious, be it debt or any other sin,
lineaments that once carried with them bad
memories and warnings seem te become attractive, and we first endure, fhen pity, then
embrace.
We heard this morning fromn the Deputy
Minister o! Finance a sfafement that what was
needed was something te encourage people
now distressed by debt; that while creditors
and debtors Lad met-and they have met by
tlionsands-and had composed their obligations,
reducing thema te practical figures which could
be faken care of, and while our ill-fated
Farmers' Credifors Arrangement Act had added
very considerably to these numbors, tliougli its
results nover more than fractionally comparcd
with the numbers of those whe looked after
their oxvn busine.ss, there wvas still a body of
people owning propcrfi-s on wieh they owed
more money than those propertios were werth.
Conseqnently, he said, the economie machine

If this is se, tIre machine las

ciple which 1 say cannot possibly be vindicated,
which cannot possibly operate in a free community. I do nlot know where anything like
this hias ever prevailed before, save under a
dictatorship. Does anybody imagine that Herr
Hitler could do as lie does to-day ini relation
to the whole economy of Germany if that
were a free country? He could nlot do so at
ail. He knew hie could do as he is doing only
by cutting ail the strands of human liberty and
taking complete personai charge. To every
citizen of that country Herr Hitler says "'Go,"ý
and hie
goeth.
1 know one country which tried for a while
to do as we are doing here and at the
same time to maintain its freedom. It is one
of the members of our own Commonwealth.
I ask anybody from the Antipodes to tell me
wbere that Commonwealth is to-day. I do
not like cven referring to the distress of a
country analogous to our own, one of our own
family, but I will make some reference te
a better situation in Australia. That country
sawv itself rushing to the edge of a precipice,
the very same one towards whieh we are
liastening, but it stopped itself in time, and
under the leadership of a real man, a forthright statesman, that country was rescued
from its doom. The rescue was made, not by
passage of 'legislation like this, not hy any
financial legerdemain, but by restoration of
old hiomely virtues. That Australian statesman, hy a reduction in his country's expenditurcs, to which reduction he made everybody
contribute-civil servants, railway employees.
capitalists, pensioners, and se on-got the sLip
of State back on an even keel. I plead with
thîs Government flot te go to such lengths,
xvîth measures like the present Bill, that our
country will be in a position where if
wvrll be unable to balance itself again.
We are moving towards that unfortunate
position. This session we have had a whole
serios of measures which are heading the

country in that direction. They may be
popular, it is true, but if popularity is to be
the

final test

of

a measure's

merits, then

good-bye to democraey, good-bye to liberty.
The very people who are cring ont against
Faseism, who are seeking to terrorize us by
warning that Fascism is on the way, are day
by day dcmanding things which can be donc
only under that form of government, and they
arre getting things which are bonnd te precipitate this country into dictatorship. This piece
of legislation is one of those very things.

longer free or it is bankrupt; it lacks the
very life and essence of a free state. A man
in a free country must carve out economic
security for himself. Besides, assistance under
this Bill is flot confined to the unfortunate.
Help is ta bie given even to the improvident,
the extravagant, tbe reckless-and in many
cases even to the well-to-do.
Let us look at the effect of this measure
ulpon agricultural cammunities. What benefit
will accrue ta the steady toiler who bas kept
within bis means, wbo -bas owned only a small
piece of land-not too large for him to workwbo bas learned his lesson early and 8tuck
to bis own last? No benefit. But it would
be incorrect ta say that the Bill bas notbing
for him. It bas a penalty. He is ta be called
upon ta cantribute ta tbe other fellow, who
expanded beyond bis means and finds bimself
overwbelmed. witb bankruptcy. However, tbere
is sometbing ta be said . if the argument is far
from convincing, far applying a measure of
ti kind ta tbe agricultural community. That
community, far more than the city or town, has
been swept by tbe visitations of Providence.
lt bas been denied tbe bounty of nature. And
agriculture is at tbe 'basis of our wbole economie structure. Sametbing can be said for
stretching generosity towards farmers, because
of an ultimate and more general advantage.
Even as ta this class, I tbink we should be
better ta refrain. In my judgment the natural
process of composition by debtor and creditor
is doing tbe necessary wark and will do it,
aIl aver tbis Dominion. Still, as I say, sometbing can be said in defence of applying tbe
mneasure ta farmers. But I know tbat, even
if we go so far and no fartber, we shall be
putting aur arms in tbousands of cases under
the corpus af the individual wbo does not
need any help at ail; and it would nat be aur
duty ta support bim. even if bie did need help.
What I mean is this. We sball be assisting
the man wbo bas anc section of land mortgaged for twice wbat it is worth, but who may
o'wn tbree or four other sections clear. In
tbe goodness of aur bearts we shall go ta b-im
and say, "We will reduce your debt on this
one section of land ta 80 per cent of its value,
and tbe State will bear baîf of tbe loss incurred
iii such reduction." Sa little do we fear debti
So little are we bound by tbe old principles
wbicb made great thbe Anglo-Saxon race!
But application of the measure ta bouses
in towns and cities is more emphatically indefensible. A man does not make bis living
out of bis bouse. True, bis mortgage may be
unreasonably high, but wha knows what ather
assets bie may bave? H1e may be prosperaus.
Tbe fact that be bas mortgaged his home for
7149"-7J

579

more tban it is wartb, may only be evidence
af bis extravagance. H1e will continue ta cara
bis living, regardiess of the big martgage on
bis home. Wby sbould we came ta the assistance of a man in that position? Measures
like this are fundamentally wrang. Tbe end
of tbem no man can sec. Would that we
cauld know "the end of this day's business ere
it came."
I do not hope-I wisb 1 could-for the
defeat of tbis Bill, but I do earnestly hope
that we can at least strip it of its ugliest
and most indefensible feature, which is the
invitation ta the city or to;wn resident who
bas bis home over-rnortgaged ta came ta the
reserv airs of the State and he rcscued at the
expense of bis fellow-man. 1 intend ta move
ta strike out ail reference ta towns and cities,
and I sincerely hope tbat amendment will
carry.in this House. I cannat question in my
own mmnd tbat it will appeal ta the saber
judgment of the Minister. I know hie said
he was oppased ta it. In committee hie did
nat tell us definitely wby; his language in this
respect was rather vague. Perhaps hie should
nat have told us. The only reasan why hie
can possibly be against such an amendment is
tbat bie needs the support of representatives
of urban communities in order ta get
passage of a new scheme of assistance for
rural debtors. If so, then it is a matter of
orgnnizing the vote behind bim ta get
the tbing tbrough. One section of the
Minister's support says, "We caîl upon the
Government ta help aur rural communities,
because tbe money cames out of the public
treasury, and that means nothing." The other
section says: "We will not consent ta your
getting anytbing, unless we get samething too.
We are just as unafraid of public debt as
you are." And s0 the Minister of Finance is
beld up. I should like ta see some support given
ta thîs amendment, in order ta sbow that there
is stili a body of opinion in Canada which
clings ta old principles, wbich feels that debt
bas the samne meaning for the nation as for
the individ-ual. Therefare I mave, secanded

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

instead of presenting his amendment in textual
form on the motion for third reading, in the
usual way, It seems to me that he might
obtain the same result by testing the opinion
of both Houses on any amendment he might

have to overhaul-the Bill in order to give effect

I should have
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to civide the House on this motion. Its
intent is apparent: that the Bill be limited
to revision of farm mortgages. My right

usual, over the state of our finances and the

The main contribution will be its share of

of reduction of interest to 51 per cent.
It will be seen that the amount which the

treasury will be called upon to contribute in
relation to mortgages on urban property is
limited to adjustments of mortgages comprised

in urban centres-and I know some of themthere are thousands of persons of modest

have invested in single-family houses for their
own accommodation, or in two-family homes.
In the latter case, of course, they derive income
from their property. Many of these householders are in dire distress, for their rentals
have decreased and their taxes increased.

We should not overlook the fact that the
help given to the farming communities of the
West is borne by the Dominion generally.

Lakes down to the Atlantic, ask that they be

of fhat portion of the Bill applying to them.
I would also remind my right honourable
friend that the Dominion Mortgage and
Investment Association, composed of fifty-one

companies, have made loans totalling $200,000,000 on farm mortgages. To the adjustment
of these loans, which are to be reviewed, he
has no objection, since lie does not attack the
Bill in that particular.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have objection to the whole Bill, but I am more hopeful
of getting it amended than defeated.
Yes, but it is

it will.

My right honourable friend says, "The
Commoners are interested in being returned
to Parliament when the electorate is consulted."
Undoubtedly this is the situation in a democratic country. Members of the House of
Commons know the needs of their people,
and they feel that it is just and equitable that
those needs be attended to by a plan applicable
to the country generally.
In times of distress there is an inclination on
the part of the people to complain that their
particular province is not receiving fair treatment from the federal authorities. I contend
that this proposed, legislation makes for
greater national unity, because we are laying
down a principle which will apply both to the
East and the West. I am convinced that my
right honourable friend is advocating a policy
which would tend to maintain what is not a
healthy state of things for this country. Our
people are scattered over a comparatively
narrow strip of land extending from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. Each province is apt
to compare its needs with the needs of
neighbouring provinces, and to feel that it is
carrying too heavy a load. I do not think

JUNE 3, 1939
mny right honourable friend will say that thie
ie a cheap demagogie appeal when I remind
him that some of our provincial premiers
have raised the cry that the East is carrying
the West.
Hanourable members wilI, I think, find in
this Bill a fair distribution of paternalism,
if yau will, but paternalism applied ini the
hope of re-esteblishing a heaithier state of
affairs. We in this Chamber recail how my
right honourable friend described the difficulti es of the farming community when he
presented ta us and endorsed the Farmers'
Creditars Arrangement Act. We ail sympathized with the situation which lie pictured,
and said "Amren"~ as we passed the Bill. He
bas since repented, saying "Mea culpa, mea
culpa, mea maxima culpa."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
We voted
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
millions of dollars ta assist drought-stricken
areas of the Western Provinces, and we did it
gladly. The purpose of this Bill je ta reestablish a heaithier condition in the body
politic, and give practical expression ta aur
sympathy for the distress of aur people
throughout the whole country.
But my right honourable friend says, "We
will cut off any help te urban propertyowners, and restrict the aperatian af the Bill
to farmere." I do not believe that that attitude
will appeal to t'he country at large. I have
mentioned that tens of thousande af aur
citizens in urban centres in the East and the
West stand, like their near neighbours the
farmers, with their backs againet the wall,
and are facing the danger of losing their
property. Are we to tell themn caolly that
they must be satisfied with their plight, and
that whatever remaine of the taxes to which
t.hey have contributed shahl he used ta help
another section of the community? That section can have no objection ta this Bill. The
whole of Canada's financial power has been
ueed ta assist the various provinces. Now,
by this measure, a deserving part of the camrnunity in the Eastern provinces may be
helped ta a certain extent.
1 would ask my right -hanourable friend not
ta insist upon hie amendment, because it ente
aur country in two as between East and West.
If gives calour ta the cry which we have
heard during the last few years that the East
ie carrying the whole burden for the West.
I would asic that the argumente we have
advanced againet that cry be nat weakened
by any apparently egatistical action on the
part of the Senate-action which would be
tantamount ta eaying ta the East, "Your funetien je ta car.ry the load af the West, and

we have nothing for you in. the way af honest,
equitable compensation."
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honaurable members, I arn persuaded that the conditions
depicted by the riglit honourable leader of the
opposition (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meiglien) will be
brouglit about by the enactment of ths propased legielation. I -hope the Bill will do
what the honourable leader of the Government
lias suggested, but I fear lie je mistaken. In
my opinion it will benefit but two classesthe farming community, mostly farmere ini the
tliree Prairie Provinces, and the boan, trust
and life insurance companies. I know tlie
loan, trust and lufe insurance companies wiil
say that 1 amn wrong and that if thie legislation had neyer been introduced they
would have been entirely satisfied. I eannat see tliat tlie Bill will benefit Ontario,
except in a few isolated mining areas where
the mines have been worked out and liouses
have become virtually af no value. There the
boan companies may get eomething out of
their mortgages. I think the came remarks
apphy ta Quebec. I believe 5 per cent je a
fair rate in tliat province. Certainly Canadian
farm boans are 'being made at a lower rate
in all the provinces. I think the Maritime
Provinces will henefit to about the came
degree. Britishi Columbia will be very little
benefited. I candidly admit that there will
be came benefit in this Bibl for the farmers
af Western Canada, eepecially t-hose in southern Saskatchewan and sauthern Alberta. By
and large, it will help ta loosen up frozen assets
in the bande of the mortgage, trust and life
insurance campanies.
My original suggestion ta tlie cammittee was
that farm mortgages should be placed in ane
categary and non-farm mortgages in another,
and that the companies applying for an agreement sliouhd have tlie option of asking that
it caver bath or only one, 'as they saw fit.
The restrictive legielation in ahl provinces
but one bears very lieavily on mortgagees.
Let me cite my own province as an illustration, thougli we were told by the Deputy
Minister of Finance and by the Minister
himehf that simîlar conditions prevail in all
provinces except one. In Manitoba we have a
Debt Adjustment Act which alaws no proceedings ta be taken on any mortgage or
agreement for sale withaut the consent of a
board. This applies onhy ta martgages and
agreements for cale made prier ta Mardi 31,
1931. Naw, thie Bill provides that the martgage companies which enter inta the agreement
wilh not have ta adjuet their mortgages in
Manitoba unbess the provincial Act respecting
mortgages je repealed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

This Bill covers

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: I said I would use Manitoba as an illustration. The Minister of
Finance said the saine law applied to eight
provinces. I don fot know which province is
excepted.
Probab]y it is Prince Edward
Island.
Before the mortgages of farmers or townspeople ia Manitoba who corne under this Bill
could be adjusted, that province would have to
repeal its legisiation in so far as it applies to
thcse mortgages. That is a distinct advantage.
True, this measure does not provide for ail,
as I think, it should have donc; but it goes
sonie of the way.
I want to say candidly that I cannot vote
for the amendment moved by the right honourable leader of the opposition, for I really
think this legisiation should include non-farm
mortgages. Furthiermore, I think the coinpanies should ho allowed to choose whether
they will corne in as respects country boans
only, city boans only, or hoth.
Remember, this legisiation does nlot affect
the individual mortgagee at all. Many boeuse
properties have second and sometimes third
rnortgages on them. These mortgages arc
not touebed. I know that mnany people ia
Winnipeg who ho]d second or even third mortgages will be delighited with this Bill, for
while the owner wiIl not get any adv antage,
the second or third mortgagee iil.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Is it not a
fact that nearly ail the farmers who are in
the worst position have second or third mortgages on their farms?

I think they have.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 cen sec that political
advantage may ho gained by this meoasure

1 think, the advantage will bc aIl the uther
way.
There is much to be said for the staternent
of the Deputy Minister that we have to start
somewhere ia order to put a stop to provincial legislation that prohihits the taking of
action for the collection of debt. I know
the right honourable gentleman (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) wvil1 say: "You are just settling
with the burgiar. He holds a gun to your
head and you settle. You may say you were
not rohbed, but hie bas got the money just the
saine." I admit that; but possihly there is
something ia the suggestion that a new spirit
wmay ho developed. 1I know considerable proslion. Mr. 1H41(.

suire will ho rcquired to induce the Goverament of Manitoba to, bring in legisiation that
wxil give the creditor any chance at ail. After
promising in 1931 that there should ho no
more legislation interfering with mortgages,
the Legfislature of that province passed a
second measure holding up mortgages. When
I questioned the Attorney-General about it
hoe said, "When you hrought to an end the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, the pressure was s0 great that we hiad to do it." I
think the Bill hefore us gives the first.ray of
hope. It is the first step towards the removal
of that provincial legisiation.
I quite admit that the right honourable the
leader of the opposition was correct in saying
that the people of Canada will have to pay
out about $45,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Over a terni of

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

miay ho six.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is a boan to

the companies at 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no. Here is what the
Bill provides.
Take a company which has
S14,000,000 in farm boans. After a valuation
is made that amount is adjusted and reduced
to $10,000.000. Immediately that is donc the
Government will give the company an interestbearing bond for $2,000,000, payable at the
rate of so, iuch a year for twenty years,
and during the whole of that period 3 per
cent will ho paid on the whole $2,000,000.
Be that as it may, 1 stili think there is
some menit in the argument of the Deputy
Minister, that a start is being made towards
inducing provincial goveraments to say their
debt legfislation shall fot apply. I admit
that if, after ail these mortgages are adjusted,
the farmers have a bad crop, tbey will be
coming to the legislatures to ask them. to
pass more deht legislation. When I asked the
Minister of Finance about that, ho smi!ed his
well-known smile and said, "WelI, there is
the power of disallowance." I confess I arn
very doubtful about that power at any time.
Nevertheless, I feel I must vote against the

amendment.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Ilonourable members, I should like to express again the view
I expressed in committee this morning, namely,
that this legislation has corne to us ton late

in the session to permit us te give it the
consîderation to which it is entitled.

JUNE 3, 1939
I thin-k I arn quite safe in saying that the
proposal made in the Bill is one that wil
have very far-reaching consequences-consequences which many o! us at the moment do
not 'begin to understand. I should very much
prefer not to vote at aîl, simply because I
do not poasess the information which I think
is necessary to enable me to vote intelligently-and I think I can understand the
practical effeets o! legisiation of this character
just about as welI as anybody in this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In passing, I should
like to speak o! the $40,000,000 referred to by
the honourable senator from Winnipeg SouthCentre (lion. Mr. Hiaig). That figure was
described by the Deputy Minister this morning as "only a rough guess."
lion. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The Minister said
the saine thing.
lion. Mr. CALDER: Exactly. We ail know
it cati be nothing else. We know also that
the extent to which this legislation will apply
and the amount involved in it are purely
matters of speculation. These are things about
which we should have been able to get some
information. Furthermore, the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was in operation for somne
years and thousandsq of cases were deait with,
but we have had no suibstantial evidence as
to the effeet on the mortgage situation of the
work done under that Act during the past
two or three years. Every one of the coinpanies was in a position to bring us exact
figures as to the amount o! the reductions
made, but we have had no information along
that line.
One of the Western members told me last
night that in one city in Western Canada
2,000 urban mortgages will corne within this
law, and aIl of them. are ready to be acted
upon if the law goes through. This information was sccured as the resuit o! a search
in the Land Titles Office.
I say this Chamber is not in a position
to deal with this Bill on its merits, simply
because we have not got the facts; and again
I say it is unfortunate that legislation of this
kind should reach us at this stage.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not like to vote
against the Bill, but because this bouse lack8
information to which it is entitled, and which
it requires in order to 'be able te deal with
the Bill on its merits, I do not want to vote
for it. How long -would At take to get this
information? I should say that even if our
Committee on Banking and Commerce had the
Bill before it for a week it would not be able
to make the necessary inquiry.

à

lion. Mr. DANDURAND:- The Bill was
before the committee of the Commons for
three days, and the evidence taken there was
printed, and is now before us.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But we do not deal
with things in the samne way as the Coinmons do. Measures of this kind undergo a
fairly exhaustive study in this House.
I wish to refer to only one aspect of the
statement of the leader of the Government.
Let me speak first of the situation that
developed in the West-a situation which was
not in any way a consequence of anything
done hy the West, or by the farmers of the
West. We suffered a calamity out there. Suppose that calamity had oecurred in the two
provinces of Ontario and Quebec, what would
have been the attitude of the West towards it?
The attitude of the West would have been
exactly the samne as was the attitude of the
East towards the West.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no doubt
of that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is no doubt of
it at ail. Every country everywhere, deals
with these natural calamities in the saine way:
sympathy goes out and help is rendered. What
the people of the East have done, in sending
thousands upon thousands of carloads of stuif
to help the poor unfortunate people of the
W est, is simply amazing.
The honourable gentleman (lion. Mr. Dandurand) referred to the help which had been
given to the provinces. Because of unemployment, and because of services that
had to be carried on, a situation arose
in which it became necessary for the
Federal Government to advance money
to the provinces. There are in the three
Prairie Provinces in the neighbourhood of
2.000,000 people. These people had to be maintained; they could not be allowed to starve.
The argument of the honourable gentleman
was that, having given assistance to the West,
the people of Eastern Canada were now
demanding a quid pro quo, and were saying,
"We must be assisted ini some way or other."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the inatter of
mortgages.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is provision for
that, in so far as agriculture is concerned, in
the Bill. A person in Eastern Canada and a
person in Western Canada, if they are ini the
samne position, will be dealt with in exactly
the samne way. The saine treatment will be
given to an urban community in the East as to
one in the West, Furthermore, the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act was applicable to
aIl Canada. I need not go further along that
line.

584

SENATE

I am very strongly inclined to the view
taken by the right honourable gentleman who
sits to my left (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
namely, that if this House or this Parliament
will assist the rural communities, the people
who are creating wealth, that is about as far
as we should go at the present time. For that
reason I intend te support the amendment.
Hon. DONALD SUTHERLAND:
Honourable members, I have listened very carefully to the debate on the measure which is
now before the Senate. It is a most significant and remarkable fact that a measure of
such dubious merit as this one should be
introduced at this stage of the session. We
have been sitting here for something like five
months, and now, when Parliament is expected
to prorogue within a very short time, we are
asked to take chances on this measure without the benefit of a well defined or confident expression of opinion by anyone as to
what the outcome of it is going to be. We
have experimented before this on many
things which have not turned out as we
expected. Earlier in this session we were
dealing with our railway problem. Honourable members who were in Parliament years
ago, when some of our large railway undertakings were being considered, will recall the
glowing predictions that were made by persons sponsoring the undertakings. To-day our
railway burden is so heavy that bankruptcy
stares us in the face. Parliament may grant
special privileges here, there and everywhere,
but we may rest assured that in the final
analysis it is the people who will have to
pay the cost.
Now, at this late stage of the session we
are asked to make another experiment, to sec
how it will turn out. The old gold-brick
story is being repeated to us: if you do not
seize the opportunity now, you may never
have it again. But why should we run the
risk of making an experiment of this kind?
There is no question that our country is a
great one. but we have passed legislation that
has made it almost impossible for many people
to earn a living in this country at the present
time. That is net as it should be. Surely we
have brains enough among our people to
overcome the difficulties that face us. I for
one am absolutely opposed to an experiment
of this kind being entered into without proper
consideration. In my view we have not given
it proper consideration, and I am sure the
people will agree with that view.
Credit is all right. Everybody is looking
for credit. But somebody has to go out and
earn money before bills can be paid. It is
possible that our farmers are suffering more
distress than is any other class in this
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

country, but taxation in general is mounting
by leaps and bounds. And here is a Bill te
reduce interest on mortgages, or to adjust
them in such a way that money may be borrowed more easily than it bas been. I doubt
very much if it would have that effect. In
any event, this granting of special privileges
and attempting te fix by legislation what
ought to be done by honest competition out
in the open, will net get this country out of
its difficulties.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: I can assure
honourable members that the people of this
country will have something to say about
what has been going on, not only during this
session, but for years past. This is a democratic country, and Parliament must be held
responsible for what is done. Many of our
members, expecting Parliament would have
prorogued before this, have gone home. Why
should about thirty members have te decide
upon this important piece of legislation? And
why was it withheld until this late hour of
the session? That in itself is enough to
cause grave suspicion in the mincis of the
people.
I am absolutely opposed to much of the
legislation which bas been passed during recent
sessions. And I feel the same way towards
this Bill, which seeks special privileges for
certain classes. I believe that if economie
conditions were as we should like them to
be, the condition of these classes would be
adjusted in the usual and regular way.

which, unfortunately, there was little more
than a quorum, decided to defy this House;
and, I am sorry to say, the leader of the House
concurred in such defiance, evidentiy taldng
the ground that the House does not control
its own proceedings and that they may be
controlled by a committee. Consequently the
committee ignored the instructions given to
it, and, despite the vote of four iqembers in
respect of each specific amendment, reported
the Bill unamended.
That leaves me only one option. I cannot
come te the exercise of that option without
expressing regret that the leader of the House,
or indeed .any other member of the committee,
should have chosen to, defy the will of the
Senate of Canada. The committee is a
creature of the Senate, and whatever may
have been the opinions of indivîdual members, its manifest duty was to carry out the
instructions of this House.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 146, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sumis of money for the
public servioe of the financial year ending the
31st March, 1940.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Might I ask
if this is the last Bill dealing with supply?
I earnestly hope so. I hope it is not lèse
majesté on the part of a senator even to
mention anything about a money bill. For
fear it is, I sit down.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I find my right
honourable friend has a great respect for the

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SENATE

Hon. E. MICHENER: Honourable &enators, the leader on this side of the House
bas moved an arnendment which really constitutes the original amendment, leavrng out
ail tlue parts of the Bill referring to nonfarmers.
As I see it, the situation in Western Canada
is this. The people in the towns and cities
are in many cases much more in need of
relief than the farmers. The merchants and
others have carried the farmers during the bad
years, and as a consequence many wbo did
so are "broke." Tbey have mortgages on their
homes, and, in my judgment, are more in
need of help through the adjustment of
mortgages than are the farmers in those districts. In every section wbere farma lands have
been hadly bit, the towns and cities have
been worse bit. Irrespective of whether this
legisiation is economnically sound or nlot, I
would ratber vote against the wvhole Bill than
against part of it. If we are going to make
the Bill applicable to the farmer in the
country, let us be fair and make it applicable
also to tbe townspeop]e, who have borne the
burden and heat of the day in helping the
farmer along. Generally speaking, the farmer
is in a hetter position than the man in the
town, for the farmer can usual]y make a living, wbereas the merebant is down and out.
For these reasons, wbile I am sorry to find
myseif opposed to my leader, I shaîl vote
against the amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should
have added to the amendment:
Tbat the necessary consequential amendments
in numerations and alterations, whetber in tbe
clauses or not, be made.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Ta the amendment to be prepared in writing?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: If tbe House
will wait for me, I can finish it in a moment.
With permission of the House I will read
the amendment again. I fear His Honour
tbe Speaker could flot easily follow my
writing. I move:
Tbat tbe said bill be not now read a third
time, but that it be amended as follows:
By deleting(a) Page 5: lines 29 to 37, inclusive;
(b) Page 6Some Hon. SENATORS: Dispense.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will read
the hast part:
and by making consequential ameodments in

Mr. Meigben) bais expressed surprise that the

CENTRAL MORTGAGE BANK BILL
MESSAGE FROM GOMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members of the Senate, a message bas been
received from the Bouse of Commons in the
following words:
Resolved that a message be sent to the
Senate ta acquaint their Honours that this
Bouse agrees te their amendments, Nos. 7, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 ta Bill No. 132, "An Act
ta incorporate the Central Mortgage Bank,"
and disagrees ta amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 8, 9, 15, 17, 18, 19 and 20 for the following
reasans:1. Because the amendments wauld make it
impossible ta accomnplish several of the fondamental objectives of the Bill as passed by this
Hanse.
71498-ffl

2. Because these amendments would deprive
tens of thousands of owners of non-farm homes
in ail provinces of Canada of the priviiege of
having their mortgages adjusted in accordance
rovsion of he ih, and particuiarly
withthe
of' having the interest rate on such mortgages
reduced to a rate flot in excess of five and
one-half per cent.
3. Because these amendinents would resuit in

4. Because with these amendments the Bill

Ment Of mortgage iending practices in this
country. Companies eligible te become member
coipanies of the proposed Central Mortgage
Ban k now confine most of their lending activities
to mortgages on non-f arin homes. Consequently,
the provisions of the Bill designed to make
available long-termn funds at low interest rates
to bie lent in accordance with the principles in
subsection 3 of section 22 of the Bill wouid have
littie practicai effect:
and disagrees with amendment No. 1 for the
following reasons:
1. Because this amendment would deprive
f armers who entered into agreements for sale
during the year 1938 at a time when grain
which
were high, good harvest, of the privilege
prices had been a and f o]lowing a year in
there
of having their agreements for sale adjusted
in accordance with the provisions of the B ill.
2. Because in many cases the original cash
payments made by such farmers were very
small and with the decline in prices and poorer
crops in the year 1938 such farmers now have
littie or no equity in their farine.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, the reasons given by the Bouse
of Commons for its refusai to accept certain
amendments we made to this Bill are weighty
ones, and those reasons, I may say, are endorsed unanimously by that Bouse.
The Bill is comprehiensive and ie intended

to lower interest rates flot only ta fariner but
also ta urban borrowers, and in the circumstances I would suggest that it be accepted.
It is stated in this message that
These amendments wouid deprive tens of
thousands of owners of non-farmn homes in al
provinces of Canada of the privilege of having
their mortgages adjusted in accordance with the
provisions of the Bill, and particularly of having

the interest rate on such mortgages reduced to,
a rate not in excess of Byve and one-hai
per cent.
Some honourable' members may be under
the impression that a large proportion of mortgage boans are carried at a rate equal to 54
per cent or lower. That may he, but tens
of thousands of borrowers in urban centres
would like to have the advantage of a iower
rate than they are paying. I know persans
who are paying 7 per cent mortgage interest
on property situated in the very heart of
Montreal. We who desire that money should
circulate more freely shouid at least appre-

àm

SENATE

ciate the fact that this Bill will break the
.shackles which hamper the farming community
in various provinces in getting mortgage loans
at a fair rate of interest, for no doubt provincial governments will feel the necessity of
extending to their people the advantages
which will flow fromn this Bill.
Other reasons are:
Because these amendments would result in
only a relatively small Ravin g to the Dominion
Treasury and the cost which t he Treasury would
still have to, bear would be out of ail proportion
to the honofits obtained by the nation.
Because with these amendments the Bill
would ot accomplish a major objective of the
Bill which relates to the permanent improvement of mortgage ]ending practicos in this
country. Companies eligibie to become member
the proposed
companies confine most of theirCentral Mortgage
Bank now of
londing activitios
to mortgages on non-f arm homes. Consequently,
the provisions of the Bill dosigned to, make
availahle long-term funds at low interest rates
to be lent in accordance with the principles in
subsection 3 of section 22 of the Bill would
have littie practical effect.
So I wouid pray that my righit honourabie
friend wili consider this situation, wiil take
the Bill as a whoie, working, as it does, for
a lowering of intercst tbroughout tbe entire
land, and will let tbe Finance Department
and tlic officiais of the Baak of Canada try
to cure tlic sure which (eats into the body
poiitic. and to give fuil playv to an casier iuovement of funds tiiroughout the country.
I sbould be most halppy if my right honourable friend would agree to second iny motion
that the Senate do not insist on its amendmnents.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, I have aiready spoken at
lengtb on two successive days on this measure,
and a very fewv sentences wiii now suffice.
The buse of Commons lias been pieased
to accept a sories of ameodments which go
no further than flic correction of obvious errors
in tlie Bill, but lias brusqueiy deciined to
accede to any that affect tbe substance of the
measure in any way at al]. The reasons given
bave this advantage: they disciose pretty
(cearly what is behind the measure. These
reasons go on to tell us the great benefits
of the Bili will not accrue unlcss we help
mortgage companies and heip people in towns
and cities wbo owe inconvenient sums of
money. The Biii wiil not attain its end, I
know; and I bave a pretty shrewd idea, wbat
tbe end is. Tbe greater the number of people
wbo can see tbe trough held out tbrougb tbe
medium of tbis measure, the botter for the
Goverament.
Tbe explanation goes on to say we shall
flot get much advantage from tbec rest of this
Bill. In otber words, the sections which go

towards assisting farmers who are overburdened witb indebtedness, and also mortgage
companies wbo have lent ton mucb to farmers,
will not benetit us much if we do not take hold
also nf what is a major objective, as set
out in clause 4. It will be somewhat of a
surprise to bonourabie members to find that
the majnr objective bas to do with the cities.
Tbis clause does, of course, give voice to
the idea, now repeated by tbe leader nf the
House, that because the Goveramont are taking
hold of tbis it. is a great mnvement to reduce
interest. Well, I express the opininn that the
Government can no more reduco the general
level of interest, and fix that level, than it
caa reduce the price of bread, or of cheese, or
of wheat, or of coal, from a natural level to
an artificiai ne. Tbe price of coal depends
on demand for and suppiy of coal; interest
rates depend on demand for and suppiy of
money; and ail this taik by the Goverament
of taking bold and getting interest down is
botb deceit of tbemselves and deceit of the
nation. Tbey caa get it down by lending
the money themselves at tbic expense of the
rest of flic country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ivill do it.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
After which the Right Honourable the
Deputy Governor General was pleased to close
the Fourth Session of the Eighteenth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with the
following speech:

JUNE 3, 1939
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House o! Gommons:
In bringing to a close a session in which, for
the first time, the King bas been present in
person in the Parliament of Canada, I desire
to express the gratification of my Government
at the universal and heartfelt rejoicing of a
united people who are being honoured by the
visit of their Sovereign.
I wish, at the samne time, to thank you for the
attention you have gîven to the many probleme
which Canada, like other countries, faces in
these critical times.
It was a source o! satisfaction to my Government that His Majesty was able to give the
Royal Assent in person to the Bill respecting
the Canada-United States trade agreement.
This agreement and the other measures which
have been enacted to meet exceptional conditions in the basic industries, and to improve
marketing facilities, will be of direct advantage
to the primary producers in all parts of t he
Dominion, and will be reflected ia increased
trade and employment.

591

Provision has been made for the establishment of a Central Mortgage Bank with the
object of easing the burden of debt upon farmers
and home.-owners.
1 arn gratified that, by the extension of the
youth training programme provision has been
made to apýply the strengtli and enthusiasm of
youth to t he conservation and development of
our great forest resources.
The insecurity of the world to-day has made
necessary increased provision for national
defence.
It is my hope that the desire for peace, which
lies so close to the hearts of the peoples of all
countries, will yet serve to avert international
strîfe, and to restore among nations co-operation,
understanding, and good will.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for the publie service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In takîng leave of you at this time, I pray
that the blessing of Divine Providence may rest
upon your labours.
