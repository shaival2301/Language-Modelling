PRESIDENT EISENHOWER
ADDRESS TO MEMBERS OF SENATE AND
HOUSE OF COMMONS
The Hon. the Speaker: As honourable

senators are aware, the President of the
United States of America will deliver an
address to members of both Houses of Parliament in the Chamber of the House of Commons on Saturday, November 14, at 11 o'clock
in the morning. In view of the limited space
available in the Senate Gallery of the House
of Commons, I have directed that the allocation of seats be confined to the wives or
husbands of senators.
THE SPEAKER OF THE SENATE
FELICITATIONS TO HON. MR. ROBERTSON ON
HIS APPOINTMENT

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Mr. Speaker,
may I take this opportunity of expressing to
you on my own behalf, and on behalf of my
colleagues on this side of the house, my
hearty congratulations upon your appointment as Speaker of the Senate.
As a former Speaker of the other placein fact, it is less than an hour since I gave
up my duties in that house-I can speak with
feeling on this subject. I know something of
the difficulties, trials and tribulations which
beset the Speaker. I also know something
of the satisfaction which comes to one after
having served in that very high office.
You bring to this office, sir, the qualities
requisite for the complete fulfilment of the
heavy duties attending it. You have had
experience in government in your native
province of Nova Scotia; and you have been
in this honourable house for a considerable
number of years, during the last eight of
which you have been Leader of the Government in the Senate and a member of the
Cabinet. This experience provides a magnificent background for the legislative aspects
of your new high office. But, Mr. Speaker,

of her charm, her grace and her friendliness.
As Speaker of the Senate you succeed a

distinguished group of men, several of whom
I see present here this morning. I know that
you will enhance the dignity and honour of
your office in the days that lie before you.

Mr. Speaker, I am sure I can pledge to you
in the discharge of your duties the loyal
support and full co-operation of your colleagues. I extend to you again, on behalf of

myself and of my colleagues, my very hearty
congratulations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Mr. Speaker, I wish
to join with the leader of the government in
his congratulations to you on your assuming
the very important office of Speaker of this
chamber. I had hoped at one time that I
myself might occupy that position.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: However, the satisfying
of my ambitions has been limited to one
occasion, namely, at a sitting last session
when the Speaker was absent and I was
requested to take the chair. I appreciated
that honour very much indeed, but I found
the chair rather confining. Thus I can sympathize with you, Mr. Speaker, in having to
sit in that chair hour after hour listening to
members of the Senate debating the questions
of the day.
Honourable senators, I have known Senator
Robertson since he first came into this chamber. He has had the required training for
the Speakership, and possesses the dignity
necessary to fill that high position. As the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has just stated, the new Speaker is
blessed with a charming and talented wife,
who I am sure will help him to carry out
his duties in a proper way.
We on this side of the bouse extend our
very best wishes to you, Mr. Speaker. You
can rely on our support at all times, provided
we think you are giving the right decisions.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

NOVEMBER 12, 1953
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We wish you ta know
that we are very pleased by your appointment, and we hope you wifl enjoy your new
position ta the full.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I arn more grateful than I can say for
the very kind expressions of good will and
congratulations on the part of the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine). I must thank them, in addition,
for their very kind references ta Mrs. Robertson.
I appreciate the remarks of the Leader of
the Government on the office which I arn now
assuming, the duties of which are so well
known to him because of his long experience
as Speaker of the other house.
I sympathize a little with the Deputy Leader
of the Opposition in the fact that circumstances have not been such as ta permit of
his appointment ta the Speakership, which
he would grace far better than I can; but
as a consolation I would remind him that
he is stili a young man, and coming events
sometimes cast their shadow before them.
Honourable senators, I arn deepiy appreciative of the honour that bas been done me,
and I shail at ahl times endeavour ta follow
the tradition and example of my distinguished predecessors, who have sa worthily
upheld the honour, dignity and autharity of
the Senate of Canada.
Hon. Senalars: Hear, hear.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
His Excellency The Governor General was

then pleased to open the First Session of the
Twenty-Second Parliament with the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to
the opening of the Twenty-second Parliament.
This is a time when, if peace is maintained,
we have every reason to look forward to
the continuing development of this prosperous
and happy nation.
The coronation of our beloved Queen was
an occasion for universal rejoicing. Her
devotion to duty, her personal charm and
her happy family life have assured Her
Majesty of a warm place in the hearts of ail
her subjects and have strengthened our attachment to the crown and to the traditions of our
constitutional system of government.
Following the legislation enacted during the
last parliament, the changes in the Royal Style
and Titles have been proclaimed by Her
Majesty.
Much remains to be done before there can
be a permanent and durable peace in the
world. My ministers therefore consider it
would be unwise for the free nations to
slacken our efforts to build up and maintain
the necessary strength to ideter aggression and
they intend to continue to work to that end.
We have every reason for satisfaction that
through the use for the first time of collective
police action the objective of the United
Nations in Korea has been substantially
achieved. The aggressors have been driven
back, the fighting has ceased and an armistice
has been concluded. My government earnestly
hopes that a political conference will ultimately succeed in restoring peace in Korea.
Canada has continued to contribute to those
international projects which will promote
human welfare and thereby remove some
of the causes of unrest and dislocation. You
will be asked to approve further assistance for
relief and rehabilitation, for technical assistance and for continued participation in the
Colombo Plan.
The alliance of the North Atlantic nations
has been effective thus far in preventing
aggression in Europe. My government continues to regard the Treaty as one of the
foundation stones of Canada's external policy.
The formation of the air division of the
Royal Canadian Air Force in Europe is now

completed. The brigade group of the Canadian Army is performing its role effectively
Canadian naval
in the integrated force.
strength is increasing.
Canada's total volume of external trade
has reached record levels. But dollar shortages in many countries have persisted and
continue to create problems for some of our
Another Commonwealth Conexporters.
ference with respect to financial and economic
matters is to be held in Australia early in
the new year.
Tariff concessions negotiated at Geneva
in 1947, at Annecy in 1949, at Torquay in
1950 and 1951 under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade have been extended
for an additional period.
My ministers are convinced that nations
can best achieve economic strength and
security through more liberal trade and overseas investment policies and they are continuing their efforts to bring about the progressive reduction of trade restrictions.
At home we continue to enjoy general
prosperity although there are some sectors of
our economy which have been faced with
difficulties. Our farmers have harvested the
second largest wheat crop in Canadian history.
Private capital investment has reached levels
never before attained. Employment is at high
levels.
While more houses are being built this year
than ever before, the growing population of
Canada requires a continued expansion of
housing. You will be asked to consider
measures to increase and broaden the supply
of mortgage money so that more people with
moderate incomes will be able to find facilities
to assist them to build their own homes.
A bill to amend the Animal Contagious
Diseases Act to provide for appropriate compensation to farmers whose hogs suffered
from cholera, will be placed before you.
The scheme initiated during the last parliament for insuring boats and certain gear has
recently been improved and is helping to meet
the hazards of the fishing industry. My
government is giving particular attention to
the development of markets for our fisheries
and to the encouragement of more modern
methods in the Atlantic coast fisheries, particularly in the province of Newfoundland
where the methods are in the greatest need
of improvement.
The strategic importance of the northern
part of Canada has increased greatly in
recent years. Its place in the economy of
Canada is steadily growing and will continue to expand in future. You will be asked
to consider a bill to change the designation
and orientation of the Department of Resources
and Development and to define the responsibilities of the government with respect to the

NOVEMBER 12, 1953
affairs of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, including the Arctic Archipelago,
and the welfare o! the Eskimos.
You wlll be asked to amend the Pipe Lines
Act to give the Board of Transport Commissioners ju-risdiction over ail companies
authorized to construct or operate interprovincial or international oul or gas pipe Uines.
The New York State Power Authority has
accepted a licence granted by the Federal
Power Commission in the United States for
the development of the United States share
of power in the international rapids section
of the St. Lawrence River. It is hoped that
litigation in the United States will not have
the effect of delaying the construction of the
project.
As further steps in helping to improve social
welfare, co-ordinated plans for rehabilitation
of disabled persons are being worked out
with the provinces and a measure to facilitate
the establishment nationwide of a federalprovincial assistance program for totally disabled persons will be su'bmitted for your
consideration.
As provided by law you will be required
to consider this year a complete revision of
the Bank Act.
The bill for the complete revision o! the
Crirninal Code which was not flnally deait
with in the last Parliament will be submitted
for your consideration.
A committee of penal experts has been
appointed to examine and report upon
methods o! parole and remission o! sentences.
Other measures which will be placed before
you for consideration include bis respecting
the Canadian Forces; the United Kingdomn
Financial Agreement; the Ontario-Manitoba
boundary; the extension for another year of
the emergency gold mining assistance; and
bis to amend the Bank o! Canada Act, the
Municipal Grants Act, the Explosives Act,
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the Customs
Act, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act, the
Atomic Energy Control Act and certain
veterans hegislation.
Members o! the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for
ail essential services including our national
defence and the meeting of our obligations
under the United Nations Charter and the
North Atlantic Treaty.

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless your deliberations and help us to corne nearer to a true
and lasting peace.

THE LATE SENATOIRS MacLENNAN AND
DAVIS
TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMOIRY

Hon. W. Rosa Macdonald: Honourable
senators, it is unfortunate that one of the
first duties that fails to me to performn
upon coming into this house is to pay tribute
to the two senators who have been called Vo
the Great Beyond since the dissolution of
the last parliament. I refer to the late senator Donald MacLennan, of Cape Breton, and
the late Senator John C. Davis, of Winnipeg.
It was my great privilege to have known
the late Senator MacLennan intimately when
we sat together in the House o! Commons
some years ago, and the news of his death
came as a great shock. It must have been
an even greater shock to the members of
this chamber where hie was an active participant in the proceedings.
The late Senator MacLennan was born on
March 22, 1877, at Chimney Corner, near
Margaree Harbour, Cape Breton, a son of
Flora MacDonald and Donald MacLennan.
After receiving bis early education in the
rural schools of Inverness hie qualified as a
teacher, and laVer went to Boston, where hie
worked for several years. Later on, bowever, he returned to Nova Scotia, where hie
attended St. Francis Xavier University,
going on Vo study law at Dalhousie 'University, from which he graduated in 1905. Following his admission to the Bar, in 1906, he
opened practice at Port Hood, and hie w;as
active in municipal affairs there, but later
hie moved to Inverness, where hie became
county treasurer and stipendiary magistrate.
His first venture into the political field
came in 1911, when hie was elected to the
provincial legislature. Subsequent victories
came in 1916 and 1920, when he was reelected, but in 1926 hie was unsuccessful in a
bld for a federal seat. However, hie was
elected Vo the House o! Commons in 1935 and,
as many of you recaîl, was summoned to the
Senate in 1940.
He is survived by his wife, the former
Matilda MacDaniel, as well as five daughters
and three sons.
As I have said, my closest association with
the late senator was in the other place. There,
the interests of his constituents were his
primary consîderation and hîs chief objective
in 11f e. In this bouse bis period of service
was characterized by active participation both
in committees and in the chamber. Probably
one of his greatest accomplisbments was as
83280-2

a prime mover in the establishment a! the
now famous Cape Breton Highland Park and
Cabot Trail.
"Danny MacLennan" will be sorely missed
from the halls of Parliament; by bis many
friends and colleagues. His keen sense of
humour and brilliant wit were the passport
Vo great popularity. In bis passing, Canada
has lost -one o! its most distinguished public
men, and Nova Scotia a worthy son.
Honourable senators must have al-so been
greatly sbocked to learn of the passing o!
Senator John Caswell Davis, o! Winnipeg,
about three weeks ago. Although I had not
known Senator Davis intimately, I shall
always remember our pleasant association
during our 'recent visit to England to attend
the Coronation o! Her Majesty last summer.
He was cheerful and appeared in good spirits
at that time, but it may well be that the strain
o! the journey was rather too mucb for him.
The news o! his death was received with the
deepest regret by bis colleagues and the many
friends he had made in Ottawa.
The late Senator Davis was born in Montreal in 1888, a son of Anne Jane Caswell and
James Daniel Davis. He was educated at
Loyola College, Montreal Business College,
Laval University and McGill University,
receiving degrees in both Arts and Mechanical
Engineering,
After entering business in Winnipeg hie
married Priscilla Guilbault, of St. Boniface,
who, together with four children, survive hlm.
The late senator was active in both the
political and business life o! Manitoba, and
indeed of the country at large. One o! bis
outstanding contributions to national life was
as a member of the Advisory Board in the
Department o! War Services, for whicb he
received the Order of the British Empire. In
bis own city be served on the Board of
Governors of St. Boniface Hospital, and was
a member of the executive of the Greater
Winnipeg Co-Ordinating Board and the
Metropolitan Planning Commission.
On the business and social side o! life, he
was a member of the Engineering Institute o!
Canada, the Association o! Professional
Engineers of Manitoba, the American Society
of National Heating and Ventilating Engineers,
and the National Fire Protection Association.
He was also a member of the Canadian
Association o! Politics and Economics.
The late Senator Davis was a past district
Deputy o! the Winnipeg Council of the Knigbts
o! Columbus, a Fourth Degree Council, and
a past Grand Knigbt. In 1940 bie organized
the Knights of Columbus Army Huts campaign.

SENATE
His gentle manner, combined with great
strength of character, won for the late Senator Davis an everlasting memory in the lives
and affections of ail members of the Senate.
To his bereaved widow and children we
extend our sympathy, and share in their
loss through the passing of a fine gentleman
and a great Canadian.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
as has been so eloquently stated by the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), this
is one of those sad occasions when we
assemble to pay tribute to departed colleagues. Since we prorogued last May, two
of our respected members have passed to the
Great Beyond, and tonight we are meeting
to say something about them. Personally,
I prefer to praise a man for his good deeds
while he is still alive, and I have always tried
to do so: nevertheless, on an occasion of this
kind it is meet for us to review the fine qualities and good deeds of colleagues who have
passed away and bring what comfort we can
to the dear ones they have left behind.
Donald MacLennan lived to quite an age;
he was over seventy-seven years old when
he died. He came from that part of the Maritime Provinces where they take their politics
very seriously, and he became one of the
keenest politicians I have known.
As has been stated by the leader of the
government, soon after Mr. MacLennan was
called to the Bar of his native province he
began the practice of law in Cape Breton
Island and carried it on until almost the day
of his death. He gave long and valuable service to Nova Scotia, having been for many
years a member of the provincial legislature;
and for thirteen years he was a very valuable
member of this chamber. I became acquainted
with him almost as soon as he was appointed,
and grew to like him and to appreciate in
the highest degree his friendship. As has
been said, he was affectionately known to all
of us as "Danny"; and he was a frequent visitor to Room 417, where the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and
I are accustomed to hold forth from about
nine o'clock in the morning until around
eleven o'clock at night.
Senator MacLennan was a good lawyer.
He had a sound legal mind, which he brought
to bear in his committee work. Also he had
a mind of his own, and was not afraid to
express his views. He had a really keen
sense of humour, and on many occasions
made some very witty addresses in this charnber. Ail in ail, he was a real "character",
with many lovable idiosyncrasies.
We are going to miss him very much.
He was a faithful attendant not only in the
chamber but at meetings of the committees

to which he belonged, and gave valuable service to his country by doing his work here
so well.
We extend to his widow and eight children
our deepest sympathy in their bereavement.
I should also like to make a few remarks
about the late Senator Davis. Not having
met him until he was appointed to this chamber, I did not know him nearly so well as I
did Senator MacLennan. Whereas Senator
MacLennan was a member of the Senate for
thirteen years, Senator Davis was here for
the comparatively short period of approximately four years. However, he was an
outstanding senator, an able representative
of the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface
and that part of the great prairie province
of Manitoba from which my leader (Hon.
Mr. Haig) comes.
Senator Davis was a friendly, congenial
person. He was a keen, aggressive and successful businessman who brought to parliament his business experience and acumen.
On that account he was a most valuable
member of this chamber, and he took quite
a prominent part in our work. Last session,
upon the death of the late Senator Doone, he
took over the chairmanship of the Special
Committee on Salacious and Indecent Literature and, near the close of the session,
brought down the final report of that committee.
Senator Davis was a man of many attributes. Amongst other things, he was an artist
of no mean ability. While he was overseas
to attend the Coronation, I met him on several
occasions and could see that his health was
failing. Nevertheless, he found the energy
to visit many art galleries and art exhibitions
in addition to performing his other duties.
When I last saw him he was about to leave
for Canada, to take an active part in the
federal elections in Manitoba. I warned him
against doing such a thing in his condition,
but he felt that it was his duty to do so.
We exceedingly regret that this esteemed
colleague will no longer be with us, and we
extend to his widow and family our deepest
sympathy.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
must associate myself with the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and the
acting leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
in the tributes they have paid to the two
colleagues who only six months ago were
with us but who have since passed from our
midst. It is always sad and melancholy to be
present when these tributes must be paid.
The occasion provides further evidence that
our lives are indeed mortal and that sooner
or later our turn must come. I knew the
late Senator MacLennan since he first came

NOVEMBER 17, 1953
to the House of Commons, almost twenty
years ago. He was a true Highland Scot,
who loved his native province and especially
his native Cape Breton Island. He had a fine
sense of humour, a great capacity for friendship, a clear insight into the business of
parliament and of government and, because
of those qualities he was highly esteemed
and was able to make a rare contribution to
the work of both houses of parliament.
It is true that Senator MacLennan lived
beyond the span allotted to man. On one
occasion during the last session I was complimenting him upon his appearance and he said
to me, "Thank you for the compliment, but
I know the years are running out". That
proved only too true. His passing is a
distinct loss to this house.
Honourable senators, I can speak with
much greater knowledge of the late Senator
Davis. For almost thirty years we enjoyed
each other's friendship, and for fifteen of
those years, during the stormy period of my
political career in the other house, we were
associated in the organization work of the
Liberal party in the province of Manitoba.
The success achieved here by the Liberal
party in the elections of 1935, 1940 and 1945
was in large measure due to his capacity for
organization, to the sanity of his judgment
and to the manner in which he discharged
his duties. Senator Davis was not only a
fine public servant, but he built up a large
and successful business and held the esteem
of both his friends and his competitors. I
do not think any higher testimony can be
given to a man than to say that he passed
through life enjoying and holding the esteem
of all those with whom he came in active
contact.
As mentioned by the acting leader opposite,
Senator Davis was an artist of some note.
He made a valuable contribution to the
cultural life of Winnipeg and St. Boniface,
in which latter city he resided. He was
always keenly interested in public affairs;
yet his character was such that during all
my association with him, often in days of
stress and strain, I never heard fall from his
lips a word that was unkind or uncharitable
to any political opponent, to any business
competitor or to anyone else. That to me,
in view of our poor human frailties, is a
matter of much significance.
He has passed from us. When the funeral
service was in progress, the great basilica of
St. Boniface was -crowded to the doors, not
merely by those who knew him intimately,
but by people of all parties and from all
walks in life. It seemed to me, as I sat
throughout the service, that no higher testimony could be paid to the character of a
man than was found in the presence there of
so many people who had known him.
83280-21

Many years ago the New England poet
Whittier wrote a lovely little poem, entitled
The Red River Voyageur. In this poem he
describes the Roman Catholic Mission,
situated on the banks of the river, with its
turrets twain, -and its bells pealing across
the air "to the boatman on the river and the
hunter on the plain". The old mission 'church
is gone, and a great stately cathedral has
taken its place. Almost within the shadow
of that cathedral we laid our friend and
colleague to rest, there to sleep his last
great sleep, "till the day break, and the
shadows flee away."
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I want to add a few words to the splendid
tributes paid by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), the acting
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
and the veteran senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). Senator Donald MacLennan
was a fellow Nova Scotian, and a long-time
friend of mine. I first came to know him
as a member of the legislature of Nova
Scotia. In those poorer days, we shared a
room in the Halifax Hotel; and we served
together in the legislature for years. We
then came to Ottawa together as members
of the House of Commons. Having served
there for a time, he was translated to the
Senate, and I followed him here five years
later.
Senator MacLennan was a keen politician
-as most men are in the Island of Cape
Breton-and he served his country well. He
was a keen debater and was able to discern
self-interest from truth very. readily. He
could be particularly caustic in repartee. He
coloured his orations with a pantomime that
was very brilliant, and he was highly effective on the platform. But withal he was
human, kind and generous. As has been
said, he worked in Boston for some years;
he earned his way through college, and it
was for that purpose that he returned to
Boston from time to time. Later, he was
called to the Bar of the province of Nova
Scotia, and practised his profession on the
island of Cape Breton. He was known to his
friends as "Little Danny", to distinguish him
from other Donalds of the same clan-and he
seemed to appreciate the name very much.
He and his wife raised a fine family of eight
children, and to his widow and children I
wish on this occasion to express my sincere
sympathy.
Senator Davis came to this chamber later.
He sat nearby, in a seat behind me, but I
did

not

know

him

so

well

as

Senator

MacLennan. He was a member of the creative profession of engineering, a profession
so necessary to the progress of this country,

SENATE
and I believe he was eminent in his profession. On the lighter side, he was an artist.
I do not pretend to be a judge of art, but on
several occasions I was much delighted when
he showed me several samples of his work
in his office.
To his widow and family I wish to express
sincere sympathy in their loss.
The thought occurs to me, and I think it
is appropriate to express it on this occasion,
in the presence of the new senators who are
with us, that a senatorship is perhaps one
of the finest appointments in the gift of the
appointments Her
Crown.
For these
Majesty's ministers must select persons of
constructive achievement, who have given
meritorious service. That being so, we know
that those who come here must have been
successful, to merit their appointment. Certainly the two late senators whose passing
we mourn this evening met this high
standard. Now that their work is finished
here, we can truly feel that they fought a
good fight. It seems to me that that is a
thought, which should bring a degree of
legitimate pride and comfort to those who
are under the shadow of sorrow and
bereavement at the present time.
Hon. John P. Howden: Honourable senators,
I have not previously taken part in tributes
to late senators in this chamber, but I feel
that I want to do so tonight. "Little Danny"
MacLennan was a man truly beloved, as I
believe every member of this house who knew
him well will testify-and we all knew him
well. He was a kind and honourable man,
and he had a great fund of harmless humour.
He greatly endeared himself to all of us,
and we are all very sorry that he is here no
more.
I knew Jack Davis for nearly forty years.
He was a fellow-townsman of mine: we both
came from St. Boniface. To give you an idea
of the type of man he was I will say this,
that when the Right Honourable Mackenzie
King first crossed Canada as leader of
the Liberal party not many came out to
meet him, and Jack Davis was one of the few
from St. Boniface who did. He was a staunch
Liberal-whether that be a good thing or
a bad thing-he was always a staunch Liberal,
as far as I know. Jack Davis took a really
big, managerial part in the elections, and if
there was a long trip to be made on a
nasty, muddy, wet road, when it was cold,
and nobody was anxious to go, Jack Davis
would go himself, always. He was a hard
worker for the Liberal party, and he would
leave no stone unturned on its behalf. He
was an outstandnig exporent of the party's
principles.

His appointment to the Senate was a just
appointment and a splendid choice, because he
was a good man. He was an engineer, an
able speaker, and a good painter, as we have
heard. But the important point is that he
was a first-class man. Jack Davis had no
faults that I know of, which is saying a
good deal. In his death this house has
suffered a heavy loss. I have already extended my condolences to his wife; and I
am sure that the whole chamber feels as
I do, very sorry that he is here no more.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
there is very little that one can add to what
has already been said, and said so eloquently,
by the honourable senators who have spoken
this evening with regard to two colleagues
whom we mourn today. I should like to add
just one word about each of them.
As bas been said, Senator MacLennan was
noted for his wit in this house. He endeared
himself to all of us by the pungent and
caustic wit with which his speeches were
often interlined, for there was one thing
about that wit of his: it was never sour and
it was never unfriendly, and the victims of
it-I myself was one of them on occasionscould laugh at his sallies just as well as
every other member of the house.
As bas been so truly said, Senator
MacLennan was a real Celt. He came from
Margaree Valley, in Cape Breton Island, and
I sometimes think that men are apt to take
on the attributes of the part of the country
from which they come. Now, any honourable
senator who has been in the Margaree Valley
will agree with me that it is one of the
nost beautiful parts of our country. In
some ways it reminds one very strongly of
the highlands of Scotland-high and rugged
mountains surrounding a smiling, cultivated
and fertile valley-and it seemed to me that
Senator MacLennan rather typified that. He
had a rugged exterior, but under that was to
be found kindress and friendliness of spirit.
Now, with regard to Senator Davis, I think
I can say that I had known him for a longer
time than any other member of this honourHe and I entered McGill
able house.
University, in the Faculty of Engineering, in
the autumn of 1908, 45 years ago, and we
had been friends since that time. Even at
that early date you could tell that he had a
great interest in public affairs and a flair
for political life. After we graduated from
McGill our ways lay 'apart for many years,
but it was no surprise whatsoever to me,
and indeed a great delight, when a few years
ago I had the great pleasure of welcoming
him here to this chamber as one of the two
members of the class of McGill 1912 who
became members of the Senate. We deplore
his loss at a comparatively early age, but
I think there is one thing to be said: he was

NOVEMBER 17, 1953
very happy to be able to attend the Coronation. He and Mrs, Davis had looked forward
to it with a great deal of interest and a
great deal of anticipation, interest and
anticipation that were fully realized in the
result. I think he died a happy man, in part
because of that. We deplore his loss, and to
his widow and to his family we extend our
most sincere condolences.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I would like to associate myself
and the province of Ontario with all that has
been said so well from both sides of the
house regarding our two late colleagues. With
both of them I enjoyed the privilege of
friendship over a considerable number of
years. Such occasions as this tend to emphasize more and more the interprovincial
character of this chamber. The loss of two
members such as they have been, one from
Manitoba and the other from Nova Scotia,
seems to me to emphasize the fact that we
here in this chamber are united in one common devotion to the idea of the unity of
Canada.
There are differences which arise, of
course from time to time. I always thought that
sometimes our friend Senator MacLennan
looked with some doubt on Ontario and other
"alien" western parts of this country, but
there certainly were no geographical limitations to his influence in this house.
I would like to refer particularly to the
late Senator John Caswell Davis, because I
knew him pretty intimately. I had lived in
Winnipeg for several years and I knew him
before he came here. When he came here in
1949 he had looked forward for a long time
to a seat in this chamber, and I never knew
any member of the Senate who cherished
more the honour that was conferred upon
him than he did.
One of the sad features of his death is that
he did not have a longer period in which
to express his desire for public service, which
was such a genuine and sincere characteristic
of his life. He had served well in all three
arenas of Canadian citizenship-locally in St.
Boniface and Winnipeg, and, as my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
has pointed out, he rendered active and valuable services to educational, religious, medical
and artistic organizations in both provincial
and federal affairs. As has also been mentioned, he won the respect and affection of
the leader and the rank and file of the party
to which he belonged. Apart from those public
causes, he had a versatility of mind which
was just beginning, I think, to be appreciated more widely in this chamber and elsewhere. He made a success of his profession
as an engineer and was identified with many

important projects in Western Canada. In art
as well as in science he was a competent and
able practitioner. He not only painted good
pictures himself, but his knowledge of the
great artists and galleries of the world was
much more extensive than his friends realized.
Before our late colleague left Canada last
summer to go abroad with his wife, he told
me that as soon as the Coronation ceremonies
were over he intended to go to Swansea,
Wales, to see a famous mural painting by
Frank Brangwyn, who also painted the beautiful decorative panel marking the entrance
into the Manitoba legislature. Senator Davis
not only visited that famous painting, but he
also saw, I am sure, the inside of most of
the old cathedrals and art galleries iii
England.
Incidentally, perhaps I may be permitted
to say now that Senator Davis had a strong
aversion to the unframed and rather outdated
examples of Canadian art which mark the
walls of this chamber. With that aversion I
must say I agree most heartily.
Reference has been made to the services
rendered by the late senator as chairman of
the Special Committee on Salacious and
Indecent Literature. Like his predecessor in
that post, the late Senator Doone, he had a
very deep interest in the subject under
inquiry, and had he lived would undoubtedly
have contributed further to the improvement
of the quality and standard of current magazines and books in Canada.
To the wife and children of the late senator
Davis, I would convey expressions of deepest
sympathy.
In recording my appreciation of the late
Senator MacLennan, I am quite aware that
at times he looked with some doubt upon
those of us who came from more westerly
parts of Canada. After he entered this
chamber, some thirteen years ago, my relations with the late senator developed into a
warm friendship. No member of the Senate
took a wider and a more genuine interest in
everything that went on here than did our
late friend; no member took a more kindly,
yet penetrating, interest in everyone of his
colleagues than he did. He had a remarkable
faculty for penetrating the pretences and
vanities of human nature, and he had a great
command of humorous satire to apply to such
frailties. His friendship was most stimulating and refreshing.
While our late friend was somewhat small
of stature, nature had endowed him with a
tongue and a wit which made him an opponent to be respected in any company. Although
he would have been the last man to seek the
description "giant-killer", he might very
appropriately have adopted that role.

SENATE
1, along with my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), had on two
different occasions the pleasure of visiting
Cape Breton and spending a little time in
that picturesque part of the country where
Senator MacLennan lived. Those experiences
add colour and understanding to one's
memory of him. Just as our old friend Senator Riley carried with him the air of Alberta's
ranches and foothills, so Senator MacLennan
will always be associated with the rugged
hills of Cape Breton. In that attractive corner
of Canada, marked by such romantic and
poetic names as Margaree, the Cabot Trail,
Middlehead and Cape Breton Highlands, the
memory of "Danny" MacLennan will be long
preserved. I salute him with the greatest
respect; and to the surviving members of his
family I should like to extend heartfelt
sympathy.
Hon. J. A. McDonald: Honourable senators,
I wish to associate myself with the eloquent
and well-deserved tributes which have been
paid to the memory of Senator MacLennan
and Senator Davis.
As I sat in my seat this evening I thought
what a fine thing it was that we should
take time to pay tribute to the memory of
those colleagues whom we now revere and
what a comfort it will be to Mrs. MacLennan
and Mrs. Davis and the members of their
families to read the report of this sitting.

It was my privilege to know Senator
MacLennan when he was for the third time
elected as a member of the Nova Scotia legislature to represent the people of Inverness.
He was an able representative; and the respect
and admiration which the people of Inverness
had for him was shown when on the day of
his funeral, October 22, a large number of
people from his own constituency and all of
the eastern part of Nova Scotia gathered to
pay their last respects.
As has been said, his wit and humour were
refreshing. In debate he vigorously supported
those things which he believed to be right.
It was not my privilege to know the late
Senator Davis as well as I knew Senator
MacLennan; however, I realize that by his
death we have lost another good senator
and fine gentleman.
I am sure I express the sentiment of all
honourable members of this house when I
say that we sincerely sympathize with Mrs.
MacLennan, Mrs. Davis, and their families.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as a further mark of respect for the memory
of our two dearly beloved deceased senators,
I would now move the adjournment of this
house.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate -adjourned until tomorrow at

Righi Hon. Louis S. Si. Laurent (Prime

honoured by the presence here today of the
President of the United States of Amýerica.

paid a visit ta the capital city of Canada.
Just ten years aga your great wartime President honoured us by carning ta Ottawa after

Of aur two nations.

When I had the privilege of being your

Mr. President, I found evidence among al
those whomn I was privileged ta meet of a
warm and frienddy feeling for the people of
Canada. That is only one reason why I
hope-and ail Canadians bath i this chamber and outside will share that hope-that

relations. Your example, as a member of
the United Nations, of vigarous and immediate resistance ta wantan aggression has

SENATE
revived the hopes of anxious peoples that,
through collective action, international peace
may be secured and maintained.
The characteristically energetic manner in
which the United States has fulfilled the
responsibilities it has voluntarily assumed
has been interpreted by a few detractors as
an indication that your country is seeking to
impose its policies on or dominate the life
of other free nations.
We Canadians are in the best position ,to
know how false are such suspicions. Although
your population and your economic and
military strength are many times greater
than ours, we have no fear that this strength
will be used to threaten or overawe us. We
are the more secure because you are a good
as well as a strong neighbour. No guns have
been fired in anger across our borders for
almost a century and a half. The only invasions from the south are of the annual
friendly variety when millions of your compatriots travel north to share in the enjoyment
of our great natural recreational facilities and
perhaps to feel the pulse of our growth.
Canadians in their turn retaliate by moving
in large numbers to experience the entertainment and cultural advantages of your great
cities and to bask in the sun of your semitropical southlands.
Of course, there are many strong American
influences on Canadian life, but these have not
prevented the growth of a distinct Canadian
feeling and culture, which flourishes and
will continue to develop alongside the influences of your dynamic society. This is as
it should be, for our own history teaches us
that co-operation can be closer when differences are recognized. Likewise, the cooperation between our two coun-tries is deep
and close because it is free and desired, not
something imposed upon a reluctant people
by a powerful neighbour.
We in Canada also feel, Mr. President, that
the powerful influence which your nation
exerts in the world community is, in action
as well as in aim, an influence for good, and
we welcome it.
Together, the United States and Canada
prove to the world that a great power and
a lesser power can work in harmony without
the smaller being submerged by his bigger
neighbour. We Canadians know that in the
interests of our mutual defence we can wisely
and safely pool many of our military resources with yours in a security system which
is genuinely collective. We know, too, that
through the instruments of diplomacy and
through direct negotiation we can solve amicably and justly the many problems which

arise along our lengthy common border.
Sometimes we may wish they could be solved
more rapidly, but we know they can be
solved in the end. And we also know that
when the Canadian view on any matter is
different from the American view, our
opinions will be listened to with patience
and respect.
That our two nations get along so well is
due in no small part to the leaders whom
the American people, in their wisdom, have
chosen. It is particularly gratifying to Canadians to see in you, Mr. President, the
Supreme Commander of the second world
war, under whose inspiring leadership the
fighting men and women of Canada made
their contribution to victory, and to see in
you also the first Supreme Commander in
Europe of the North Atlantic Alliance. In
that capacity you received into your command
the Canadian brigade group in Germany and
laid the plans for the Canadian air division
which is now in Europe.
As a supreme commander in war and in
peace, and as the political head of your
nation, you have justly earned a reputation
for fair-mindedness and friendliness, sincerity
and integrity. Those are noble qualities.
They no doubt are the qualities which inspired the editorial writer of one of our
leading newspapers on learning of your
visit to this country to say:
The President of the United States will be
welcome to Canada, welcome not only as head
of a great world power but as a man we have
already met and liked, admired and respected.

(Translation):
Mr. President, in this country and in this
house where there are two official languages,
I wish also to tell you in the language of my
French ancestors that all my fellow-citizens
of the same origin as mine are just as happy
as our English-speaking Canadians to have
this opportunity of wishing you and Mrs.
Eisenhower the heartiest welcome and to
assure you of our highest consideration.

Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the
United States of America.
Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower (President of
the United States of America): Mr. Speaker

Prime Minister, members of the Canadian
Houses of Parliament, distinguished guests
and friends:
(Translation):
I also extend greetings to my Frenchspeaking Canadian friends. I know that I
am very foolhardy in even trying to express
myself in this tongue. Therefore, I crave

NOVEMBER 17, 1953
your indulgence for al the mistakes which
I may make in personally and directly expressing to you my feelings of friendship and of
high esteem.
I salute you also for the important part
which you have played, in co-operation with
your English-speaking fellow-citizens, in the
development of this great country.
(Text):
Mr. Prime Minister, for the very great
generosity of the personal welcome that you
have expressed toward me I am humbly
grateful; as well as for the reception that Mrs.
Eisenhower and I have experienced here and
throughout this city. We should like to
extend to all your people our very deep
appreciation, especially for the honour of
being received before this body. I assure
you that you have given us distinction that
we shall never forget.
Since world war II I have now been
privileged three times to visit this great
country and this beautiful city.
On my first visit, more than seven years
ago, I came to express to the Canadian people
a field commander's appreciation of their
memorable contribution in the liberation of
the Mediterranean and European lands. On
my second, I came to discuss with your
governmental leaders your country's role in
the building of Atlantic security. Both visits,
in the warmth and spirit of a great people's
welcome, were days that I shall remember
all my life.
This day I again salute the men and
women of Canada.
As I stand before you, my thoughts go
back to the days of global war. In that conflict, and then through the more recent
savage and grievous Korean battles, the
Canadian people have been valorous champions of freedom for mankind. Within the
framework of NATO, in the construction
of new patterns of international security, in
the lengthy and often toilsome exploration
of a regional alliance, they have been patient
and wise devisers of a stout defence for the
western world. Canada, rich in natural gifts,
far richer in human character and genius, has
earned the gratitude and the affectionate
respect of all who cherish freedom and seek
peace.
I am highly honoured by the invitation of
the parliament of Canada that I address it.
For your invitation is rooted in the friendship and sense of partnership that for generations have been the hallmark of relations between Canada and the United States. Your
country, my country-each is a better and
stronger and more influential nation because
each can rely upon every resource of the

other in days of crisis. Beyond this each can
work and grow and prosper with the other
through years of quiet peace.
We of our country have long respected and
admired Canada as a bulwark of the British
commonwealth and a leader among nations.
As no Soviet wile or lure can divide the
commonwealth, nothing will corrupt the
Canadian-American partnership.
We have a dramatic symbol of that partnership in the favoured topic of every speaker
addressing an audience made up of both our
peoples--our unfortified frontier. But though
this subject bas become shopworn and wellnigh exhausted as a feature of after-dinner
oratory, it is stil a fact that our common
frontier grows stronger every year, defended
only by friendship. Its strength wells from
indestructible and enduring sources-identical
ideals of family and school and church, and
traditions which come to us from a common
past.
Out of this partnership bas evolved a progressive prosperity and a general well-being,
mutually beneficial, that is without parallel
on earth. In the years ahead, the pace of
our mutual growth will surely be no less.
To strive, even dimly, to foresee the wonders
of Canada's next generation is to summon
the utmost powers of the imagination. This
land is a mighty reservoir of resources.
Across it, at this moment, there moves an
extraordinary drama of enterprise and endeavour-Canadians, rapidly building basic
industries, converting waters into hydroelectric energy, scrutinizing your soil for new
wealth, pushing into the barrens of the north
for minerals and oil. You of Canada are
building a magnificent record of achievement,
and my country rejoices in it.
More than friendship and partnership is
signified in the relations between our countries. These relations that today enrich our
peoples justify the faith of our fathers that
men, given self-government, can dwell at
peace among themselves, progressive in the
development of their material wealth, quick
to join in the defence of their spiritual community, ready to arbitrate differences that
may rise to divide them. This parliament is
an illustrious symbol of a human craving, a
human search, a human right to self-government.
AU the free legislatures of the world speak
for the free peoples of the world. In their
deliberations and enactments they mirror
the ideas, the traditions, the fundamental
philosophies of their respective nations.

SENATE
On the other hand, every free nation, secure
in its own economic and political stability,
reflects the responsible leadership and the
wise comprehension which its legislature has
brought to the management of public affairs.
This continent uniquely has been a laboratory of self-government, in which free legislatures have been an indispensable force.
What is the result? It is a mighty unity built
of values essentially spiritual.
This continent, of course, is a single physical and geographical entity. But physical
unity, however, broken by territorial lines,
fortress chains and trade barriers, is a characteristic of every continent. Here, however,
independent and sovereign peoples have built
a stage on which all the world can see:
First, each country's patriotic dedication to
its own enlightened self-interest, free from
vicious nationalistic exploitation of grudge or
ancient wrong.
Second, a joint recognition that neighbours, among nations as among individuals,
prosper best in neighbourly co-operation,
factually exemplified in daily life.
Third, an international will to cast out the
bomb and the gun as arbiters and to exalt
joint search for truth and justice.
Here on this continent we present an example that other nations some day surely will
recognize and apply in their relationships
among themselves. My friends, may that day
be close because the only alternative-the
bankruptcy of armament races and the suicide
of nuclear war-cannot for long, must not for
long, be tolerated by the human race. Great
has been our mutual progress. It foreshadows
what we together can accomplish for our
mutual good.
Before us of Canada and the United States
lies an immense panorama of opportunity in
every field of human endeavour. A host of
jobs to be done together confront us. Many
of them cry for immediate attention. As we
examine them together in the work days
ahead, we must never allow the practical
difficulties that impede progress to blind our
eyes to the objectives established by principle
and logic.
With respect to some aspects of our future
development I hope I may, without presumption, make three observations.
The first is: The free world must come to
recognize that trade barriers, although
intended to protect a country's economy, often
in fact shackle its prosperity. In the United
States there is a growing recognition that
free nations cannot expand their productivity
and economie strength without a high level
of international trade.

In our case, our two economies are enmeshed intricately with the world economY.
Obviously we cannot risk sudden dislocation
in industry and agriculture and widespread
unemployment and distress, by hasty decisions
to accomplish suddenly what inevitably will
come in an orderly economic evolution.
"Make haste slowly" is a homely maxim with
international validity.
Moreover, every common undertaking, however worth while it may be, must be understood in its origins, its application, its effects
by the peoples of our two countries. Without
this understanding it will have negligible
chance of success. Canadians and citizens of
the United States do not accept government
by edict or decree. Informed and intelligent
co-operation is, for us, the only source of
enduring accomplishment.
To study further the whole subject of
United States foreign economic policy, we
have at home appointed a special commission
with wide representation, including members
of the Congress as well as spokesmen for the
general public.
From the commission's
studies will come, we hope, a policy which
can command the support of the American
people and which will be in the best interests
of the United States and the free world.
Toward the strengthening of commercial
ties between Canada and the United States,
officials of our two governments have for
some months been considering the establishment of a joint economic and trade committee.
This committee, now approved, will consist
of cabinet officers of both countries. They
will meet periodically to discuss in broad
terms economic and trade problems and the
means for their equitable solution. I confidently believe that out of this process the best
interests of both our countries will be more
easily harmonized and advanced.
The second observation is this: Joint
development and use of the St. Lawrencegreat lakes waterway is inevitable, is sure
and certain.
With you, I consider this
measure a vital addition to our economic and
national security. Of course, no proposal yet
made is entirely free from faults of some sort.
But every one of them can be corrected, given
patience and co-operation.
In the United States my principal security
advisers, comprising the National Security
Council, favour the undertaking for national
defence reasons. The cabinet favours it on
both security and economic grounds. A committee of the United States Senate has
approved a measure authorizing it.
This measure provides for United States
participation in a joint development by
both countries. The proposal now awaits

NOVEMBER 17, 1953
action by the United States Senate which,
I am confident, will act favourably on it
or some similar measure. The ways and
means for assuring American co-operation
in this great project will, I hope, be authorized and approved during the coming session
of the Congress.
I have noted with satisfaction the New
York Power Authority's acceptance of the
Federal Power Commission's licence. With
this act the stage is set for a start on the
St. Lawrence power project which will add
materially to the economic strength of both
countries.
My third observation is this: You of
Canada and we of the United States can and
will devise ways to protect our North America from any surprise attack by air. And
we shall achieve the defence of our continent
without whittling our pledges to western
Europe or forgetting our friends in the
Pacific.
The basic threat of communist purpose still
exists. Indeed the latest Soviet communication to the western world is truculent, if
not arrogant, in tone. In any event Our
security plans must now take into account
Soviet ability to employ atomic attack on
North America as well as on countries,
friendly to us, lying closer to the borders
of the U.S.S.R. Their atomic stockpile will,
of course, increase in size, and means of
delivery will improve as time goes on.
Each of our two nations seeks a secure
home for realization of its destiny. Defence
of our soil presents a challenge to both our
peoples. It is a common task. Defensively,
as well as geographically, we are joined
beyond any possibility of separation. This
element in our security problem is an accepted
guide of service leaders, government officials
and legislatures on both sides of the border.
In our approach to the problem, we both
realize that purest patriotism demands and
Thus we
promotes effective partnership.
evolve joint agreements on all those measures
we must jointly undertake to improve the
effectiveness of our defences, but every arrangement rests squarely on the sovereign nature
of each of our two peoples.
Canada and the United States are equal
partners and neither dares to waste time.
There is a time to be alert and a time to
rest. These days demand ceaseless vigilance.
We must be ready and prepared. The threat
is present. The measures of defence have
been thoroughly studied by official bodies of
both countries. The Permanent Joint Board
on Defence has worked assiduously and effectively on mutual problems. Now is the time
for action on all agreed measures.

Steps to defend our continent are of course
but one part of the world-wide security
program. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for example, is an essential defence
for Ottawa, for Washington, and for our
neighbours to the south, as well as for communities thousands of miles to the eastward.
Implicit in the consultations and detailed
studies which must continue and in the
defences which we have already mounted
is the need for world-wide vigilance and
strength. But the purpose is defence. We
have no other aim.
In common with others of the free world,
the United States does not rely on military
strength alone to win the peace. Our primary
reliance is a unity among us forged of common adherence to moral principles. This
reliance binds together in fellowship all those
who believe in the spiritual nature of man,
as the child of God.
Moreover, our country assuredly claims no
monopoly on wisdom. We are willing, nay,
anxious, to discuss with friends and with any
others all possible paths to peace. We will
use every means, from the normal diplomatic
exchange to the forum of the United Nations,
to further this search. We welcome ideas,
expressions of honest difference, new proposals and new interpretations of old onesanything and everything honestly offered for
the advancement of man's oldest aspiration.
There are no insoluble problems. Differences can be resolved; tensions can be
relieved. The free world, I deeply believe,
holds firmly to this faith, striving earnestly
towards what is just and equitable.
My friends, allow me to interpolate here
an expression of my own personal faith. I
call upon all of you who were in responsible
positions, either in civil government or in the
military world, in the dark days of 1940,
1941 and 1942. There seemed no place from
which to start to conquer the enemy that bid
fair to enslave us all. Already he had put
most of Europe under his heel. I stop to
think of the bewilderment of our people, the
fears of our people in those days, and then
of how in -a few short years we were coming
home to celebrate that great victory that we
thought could at last mark the end of all
wars. We see how fast human outlook can
change from one of despondency, almost of
despair in many quarters, to one of exultation. Today as we fail to understand the
intransigence that we feel marks others, as
we try to colour every proposal we make
with what we believe to be reason, understanding, even sympathy, as we are nonplussed as to why these offers are never
taken up, let us never despair that faith will
win through.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR

ADDRESS IN
ADJOURNED

REPLY-DEBATE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the First Session
of the Twenty-Second Parliament.
Hon. Mariana B. Jodoin moved:
[Translation:]
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor Generai of Canada:

To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions
of Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada.
May it please your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled,
beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your
Excellency for the gracious speech which Your
Excellency has addressed to both houses of parliament.

She said:
(Translation):
Honourable senators, for the first time in
the history of this country, a woman is
awarded the honour of moving the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
This occasion strengthens the fine traditions
of our Canada, which advocate the freedom
of one and all to express their opinions, and

which concede that freedom to women, since
distionaries define the word "person" as a

generic term embracing both sexes.
This is the year of crowning achievements.
I salute with respect and affection our

Gracious Sovereign Elizabeth II, who, despite
her youth, gives to the whole world an
example of a model wife, of an admirable
mother who knows how to reconcile her
family obligations with those of her royal
rank. Neither the pomp and circumstance
of the ceremonies of the Coronation, nor the
acclamations of people from every land
caused our Sovereign to lose the idea of the
responsibilities she accepted as a heritage
from this fine English family, whose steadfast principles safeguard our freedom and
our beliefs. Following her example, we,
Canadian women, strive to be dutiful. I beg
Her Majesty, our worthy Sovereign, to accept
the tribute of Canadian women and of the
Canadian Senate, and the assurance of our
entire trust and respect.
Honourable senators, the honour which is
now conferred upon me, after years of devotion to my country and to my party, is an
encouragement for Canadian women, especially French-speaking women, whatever their
political opinion, for they understand that,
sooner or later, their efforts and their devotion will be acknowledged by the leaders
of this country. Who understands it better,
at the present time, than the one who
presides over the destinies of our country,
the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, who
has made a gesture of confidence towards
Quebec, as well as towards New Brunswick
and British Columbia? The women from
these provinces, especially those from Quebec,
thank from the bottom of their hearts the
Right Honourable the Prime Minister for this
outstanding honour, which I shall try te

NOVEMBER 18, 1953
deserve and which gives recognition to the
part that women must play in the management of the affairs of the nation if they are
to look after the interests of the Canadian
family. We were looking forward to that
event, with a broad spirit open to the comprehensive ideas of the needs of the Canadian family now replenished by the excellent
and controlled immigration of people of
different races, religions and languages, but
who, while learning to love our country and
to appreciate its generous hospitality, will
become the source of true Canadians who
will settle our immense country. Thus will
be realized the hope which Our Holy Father,
Pope Pius XII, expressed in a recent letter
in which he wrote that "every individual is
entitled to a piece of soil in countries where
there is an over-abundance of land".
The tribute which I am paying the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister refiects in
a small way the feelings that the whole of
Canada expressed to him on the occasion
of the general election, last August. An atmosphere of contentment, a wave of enthusiasm, followed him throughout the country.
Men and women were asking for a look of
approval and encouragement, while the small
children received from him a kind attention
which strongly impressed their young minds.
The greatness of the Right Honourable the
Prime Minister flows from the frankness, the
righteousness and the honesty of his heart.
The country expressed its admiration
for him by the vote of confidence which has
carved in history the name of Louis St.
Laurent.
At the Coronation we admired again his
dignified personality in an all-important rank;
his distinguished silhouette showed up among
the notable guests and helped further to
feature in an outstanding way among the
representatives of the world the greatness of
aur beloved Canada. We must not fail to
associate with his success the name of Mrs. St.
Laurent, his distinguished wife, whose qualities we admire and whom we shall imitate
in ber worthy life as the First Lady of
Canada.
Our Prime Minister will soon depart again
for far-off countries where his prestige will be
beneficial to our own country. 'His fascinating personality radiates indeed an assurance
of good will and no one will have any doubts
about the future and the character of a
nation which bas chosen such a leader. May
this impression spread to Korea, may it
give heart to our soldiers, stop if possible
this awful war which is destroying whole

generations, mowing down youth and setting
bounds to the expansion of a better world.
rise against war,
Mothers everywhere
which snatches away their children; they
oppose that more awful and threatening war,
the atomie war, which would not spare anything from destruction, neither women, nor
children, nor the old people; it would annihilate civilization as well as all hope. May the
United Nations keep their eyes open to the
production of these fiendish weapons which
,are the cause of the anguish and the distress
of our times.
The members and representatives of the
U.N.O. must soon convene and discuss
world problems in an effort to solve them.
Is it not the right time, honourable senators,
to express our own ideas and make the best
of them for the good of humanity? We are
assured that the Minister of External Affairs,
who leads the Canadian delegation, and the
Postmaster General, one of the members of
the delegation, will do all they can to obtain
for us a lasting peace which, we hope, will
last for ever. Such is the wish of the mothers
of the world, and they have faith that their
representatives wll obtain this supreme
blessing.
To enliven this hope, we had the honour
to welcome the President of the United States,
Mr. Eisenhower. We feel confident that his
visit, a milestone in our parliamentary history, will open an era of co-operation and
friendship, during which will be built up a
solid wall against the invader who wants to
achieve mastery of the world. With the
support of this powerful President, the leader
of a nation of 140 million inhabitants, let our
hope grow, let our country enjoy greater
liberty and look again to the future with confidence. While waiting for that complete
freedom, we may admire the adroitness, the
tactfulness and the concern for security which
our government has shown on the national
and international level, when consolidating
our defensive forces in order to thwart a
surprise attack. Our military power is now
the strongest and our forces the best equipped
we have ever had in peacetime. The Right
Honourable the Prime Minister has personally
found out that the newly organized St. John
Military College has already yielded very fine
results. The cadet officers there know both
languages, and that is a great asset to them.
They will become invaluable leaders and give
us strong support, especially in these critical
and uneasy times. After undergoing military
training on a voluntary basis, our young men
will develop into leaders and defenders of our

SENATE
freedom and, by their gallantry and their
fortitude, will focus on our country the attention of other nations. Those now on the battle
front enjoy our unqualified admiration; we
wish them success and we pray to God that
they may vanquish the enemy. I salute in a
special manner the 3,200 women serving with
the R.C.A.F.
(Text):
Honourable Senators, His Excellency the
Governor General has appointed the honourable gentleman from Shelbourne (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) as Speaker of the Senate. We
know the excellent qualities which the
honourable gentleman displayed as Leader
of the Government in this chamber. I am
sure that during his term as Speaker the
members of the Senate will receive from him
the unfailing tact and courtesy which
characterized his predecessor, the honourable
gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard).
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin: Mr. Speaker, I am also
sure that I speak for all Canadian women
when I ask you please to accept the expression of our respect. It is, I believe, a unique
accomplishment in the world, for a people
speaking two languages and possessing
divergent opinions, to build up a nation such
as ours through mutual understanding and
respect, as well as through co-operation in
enterprise and action.
Because of our
relatively small population our country is no
doubt regarded abroad as a small nation,
but with its immense resources, rich territories and large industries, Canada is steadily
assuming much wider proportions in the
eyes of the world. And if we all follow the
example of His Honour the Speaker in the
faithful performance of our duties, Canada
must inevitably develop into a great nation.
And here, honourable senators, will you permit me to say that I believe the appointment
of a French-speaking lady senator will
strengthen the bond which unites Canada's
two races in the very distinct entity that we
present to the rest of the world.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin: May f take this opportunity of paying my respects to our two lady
colleagues-the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) and the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis) who have so efficiently represented
the women of Canada here for many years.
I do not think this Upper House has had any
reason to regret their ýappointment. I trust
that with them the new appointees of our sex
-the honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), the honourable senator

from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) and Iwill endeavour to prove to our male colleagues that nowhere on earth is it good for
men to live alone-even in the SenateHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin: -and that they will
find us eager always to assist them in their
decisions on questions of the day, while at
the same time we study and discuss these
questions from the woman's point of view.
Also I should like to express my compliments to the honourable senator from Brantford (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), the newlyappointed Leader of the Government in this
bouse. I am sure that he fully possesses the
ability and the diplomacy which that important position demands.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin: May I be permitted to
recall now the memory of my predecessor,
the honourable Athanase David, who formerly represented Sorel in this house.
That gentleman, who was idealistic and
realistic as well, will ever be remembered in
the province of Quebec for his many achievements in the realm of arts and education. I
wish to pay a tribute to his memory and I
hope that I shall be of help to that division of
which I am now the representative, where so
many huge industries have developed and
have attained a degree of improvement that
is quite comforting.
When one glances at the achievements of
the government, one feels proud to note that
its leaders are doing their utmost to shape
the future of our country. The trade relations between the United States and Canada
are carried on in an atmosphere of friendliness. "Everyone has faith in a common goal,
but difficulties arise sometimes as to what
method should be followed to attain that
goal," stated the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister, at the international meeting of
mayors in Montreal. "In short, trade is a
means to attain an end and this end is a
standard of living as high as possible for
those who participate in that kind of international co-operation."
In addition, we must indeed congratulate
our government upon its substantial and tangible achievements in the field of public
health. Every effort has been made to fight
mental diseases, tuberculosis, cancer, especially during the last five years.
Similar
improvements have been recorded in the
realm of health: specialized services, services
for diagnosis, clinics, rehabilitation units, and
all kinds of organizations for improving

NOVEMBER 18, 1953
the health of the people of Canada. The
mothers of Canada are grateful to the government which protects public health through
wise hygienie measures, childhood by means
of family allowances, and old age by means of
pensions which give security.
Those beneficial social security measures
that the Liberal party improves constantly
are evidence of its solicitude towards the
masses which, in all parts of Canada and
according to their needs, await help and
encouragement from their leaders.
Our
government was wise enough to call to its
leadership
an
outstanding
personality,
admired and respected by all the great men
of the world, and who presides over the
destiny of his country like a "good father"
anxious to make everyone happy.
The future of our country seems to be
assured, judging by the Speech from the
Throne, which contemplates such splendid
plans as the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway.
That important endeavour will facilitate
shipments of commodities and goods, will be
of great help to agriculture and to industry
and commerce. It is our duty to develop
our electric power resources through the barnessing of our powerful river. The St.
Lawrence Deep Waterway meets indeed a
pressing need for the whole North American
continent, and all the people of Canada should
approve such a project and co-operate in
every possible way.
What about housing improvement? That
tremendous problem is responsible for many
sufferings which in turn are often the cause
of family breakdown. It is the woman who,
more than anyone else, suffers from such
circumstances. Our government tries to provide, through loans, the funds necessary for
the financing of new houses. Low-wage
earners and young people as well will be
comforted by other provisions. They provide practical means to build their own homes,
which will add to the wealth of our country and increase the number of home owners
who will live happily.
National unity was featured recently on
the occasion of the unveiling of the monument erected in Montreal to the memory of
our great statesman Sir Wilfrid Laurier. The
history of nations contains moments of
exceptional grandeur. We lived such a
moment while attending that ceremony.
One could feel a spiritual relation between
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, that great Canadian,
admired by everyone, and the man who was
paying him tribute on behalf of his people,
the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent.

-both
champions of national unity and
sincere workers in the cause of international
peace. Thanks to them, Canada will hold a
leading place among nations; its economic
expansion will attain to unpredictable
heights. Our country, with its forests, its
agricultural and industrial resources, its huge
territory, will soon become the most beautiful
country in the world, thanks to its government and its able leaders. Canada bas set an
example for all nations by the effective way
she has solved her economic, domestic and
international problems, said Mr. Camille
Gutt, Chairman of the International Chamber
of Commerce. May I conclude with these
words: Let us build, erect and safeguard the
future of Canada. This country built on rock
will withstand any foreign attacks, and its
sons will proudly stand under the national
flag which our government will no doubt give
us in the very near future.

Hon. Muriel McO. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, it is a very great privilege for me
to have the opportunity to second the address
of the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon.
Mrs. Jodoin) on the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. I congratulate her on her eloquence, her charming
presentation of the part that women can take
in this bouse, and I admire her very much
for being able to speak to you in both of
Canada's official languages. This privilege,
I feel, is a tribute to the women of Canada,
and I thank our Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent, who, I am
very happy to know, will again be the head of
our government for the next few years, and
who will undoubtedly lead us toward peace,
and more prosperity and higher esteem
amongst the other nations of the world than
he has done even in the past.
Although I am new in this bouse, so new
that it almost seems presumptuous on my part
to do so, I would like to congratulate His
Honour the Speaker, (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
and the Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on their recent
appointments.
Honourable senators, I feel deeply honoured
to be one of the three women recently chosen
for appointment to the Senate, one of whom
comes from the West, one from our central
provinces and one from the East Coast, to
represent women and to sit in this house as
representatives of women, together with the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) and the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis). Like the

SENATE
former speaker, I trust that we newlyappointed representatives will bring as much
credit to women, and be as representative of
them, as the two honourable senators I mentioned always have in the past.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
I feel that far too little is known by the
people of Canada of the work done by members of this house and of its contribution to
Canada's stability. That may be one of the
things that women can make better known to
our Canadian people, because I think our
people should know that.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Despite my appreciation of the honour of being admitted to
membership in this distinguished body, I
approach the task before me this afternoon
with the greatest diffidence, and assure you
that since I was invited to assume this
responsibility I have felt that I resembled in
feelings, though certainly not in feature, the
beautiful Bride of Burleigh when "a trouble
weighed upon her and oppressed her night
and morn with the burden of an honour into
which she was not born."
Although when I was born such an honour
could not have been bestowed on a woman
in Canada, we Canadian women are very
proud that we can now be called to this service. And we are proud to call attention to
the plaque at the entrance to this chamber
which commemorates the names of Judge
Emily Murphy, the Honourable Irene Parlby,
Mrs. Nellie McClung, Mrs. Louise McKinney
and Mrs. Henrietta Muir Edwards, the five
courageous women who played such a valiant
part in bringing before the government the
need of a decision by the courts on whether
or not women should be considered persons
under the British North America Act, and,
therefore, eligible to be called to this house.
It was due to the persistence of these women
that the question was finally referred by the
government to His Majesty's Privy Council,
which ruled in favour of the recognition of
women as persons. I am very glad to have
an opportunity to acknowledge publicly the
debt owed by our sex for the pioncer work
done on our behalf by these women. A
memorial, fitting and even more enduring,
will be the contributions being made now and
which I believe will be made in the future by
women members of this house.
But I admit that we women have been slow
to follow the lead of those who pointed the
way for us. We should have pursued their
idea of going into politics and into government many years ago. However, within recent
years there has been a very decided up-

swing in women's interest in government, not
only on the higher levels, but on -all levels,
and there seems to have been a tendency on
the part of men to welcome women and to be
glad to have their assistance.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: All over the world
countries are realizing that they have
"woman-power" as well as man-power, and
that ýamongst their women is a tremendous
resource of public-spirited individuals, many
of them well-trained and able and willing to
contribute much to government on all levels.
Countries that fail to make use of this womanpower are wasting much of their potential
strength. But Canada is not amongst those
countries. We know that Canada is one of
the far-seeing countries that are making use
of the capabilities of their women. That is
shown by the recent appointments of women
to this house and by the election of more
women to the other place than at any time
in the past.
The crowning event of 1953 was, of course,
the coronation of our beloved Queen; and we
believe that, sparked by her devotion to public duty, women will achieve more during the
reign of the Second Elizabeth than ever before.
That our government is concerned with the
problems of the working woman is shown by
the recent establishment in the Department
of Labour, under the leadership of our present
Minister of Labour, of a Women's bureau, to
be directed by a woman who will rank with
the heads of other divisions in the department. We consider that this is a wonderful
step forward, as it is expected that the bureau
will give leadership in providing for equality
of opportunity between men and women and
will iron out many of the other problems facing women in industry and in other fields of
labour.
Alerted, as we women probably will be,
by the thousands of members of the powerful and interested women's organizations of
Canada, we shall be bringing to your attention
opportunities where women can serve and
where they can receive further recognition.
Honourable senators, all of us in this house
will be interested to learn of the plans, mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, for
the rehabilitation of disabled persons, and of
the proposed program of federal-provincial
assistance for the totally disabled. These
further steps to improve the social well-being
of many Canadians will be welcomed. In my
former position, which was connected with
the administration of welfare, I had very
many requests from disabled people for help
and there was no one in our province to

NOVEMBER 18, 1953
whom I could refer them. I know that some
provinces have legislation for the assistance
of their disabled, but I trust that all provinces
will ýco-operate with the federal government's
plans and progra-m.
The proposed measures to broaden the
supply of mortgage money, which will enable
people with low incomes to build their own
homes, are another step in the goal towards
providing a bouse for every Canadian family
that wants one. That certainly is a forward
step in Canadian welfare. We know how
important it is for people to be properly
housed, and in the final analysis these
measures will result in a saving to our
country because of improved conditions in
home life.
The fishermen's insurance which was
recently inaugurated by the federal government does away with much of the economic
hazards for the fishermen from our coasts
who "go down to the sea in ships" to make
their living. I am well aware of this, for I
was born and bred on the shores of Northumberland Strait and I know that, besides
the physical hazards, fishermen are exposed
to economic hazards. In a big storm, for
instance, many men might lose their whole
life savings. For that reason I believe that
the further plans to assist fishermen, as forecast in the Speech from the Throne, would
be welcomed very warmly in our Atlantic
provinces, at least.
I think we all realize that the future peace
of the world depends a great deal on the
improvement of living conditions for the
teeming millions of people in the East and,
therefore, we expect that, as stated in the
Speech from the Throne, we shall be called
upon to contribute further assistance for relief
and rehabilitation, for technical assistance
and for continued participation in the
Colombo Plan. I know we shall all be interested to learn the views of the Prime Minister
when he returns from his trip after visiting
the countries which we have already assisted
under this plan.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to discuss at this time all
the items in the Speech from the Throne, but
I hope that at a future time I may be able
to make some further comments in this
chamber on these matters. Because I feel that
my appointment both to this house and as the
seconder of the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne is a
recognition of my province of New Brunswick as well as of women, I would like to tell
you very briefly that my province is undergoing what could almost be called a second

youth. A number of quite recent developments
have brought that about, and I know you will
be interested to learn that in most of these
developments the federal government has
played a very large part by the assistance
it has given us.
You will remember that in the middle of
the nineteenth century New Brunswick was
very, very prosperous. That was due to our
forests, which contained large stands of tall
pine trees, from which we secured masts
for the King's ships and lumber to make
wooden ships. In the middle of the nineteenth century our city of Saint John was
the fourth largest ship-owning port in the
whole world. But the days of wooden ships
-those days when it was said that New
Brunswick was noted for wooden ships and
iron men-are gone. There is no demand
for our wooden ships any more, but there
certainly seems to be still a demand for our
men, for we find them in outstanding positions throughout Canada, the United States
and in other parts of the world. When ships
no longer required masts, and were built of
steel instead of wood, our prosperity flagged.
It was revived by the growth of the pulp
and paper industry, which certainly gave an
impetus to our economy. We were getting
along very well with that industry when we
were attacked by the spruce bud-worm, a
great enemy of our forests. We are fighting
this despoiler of our wealth by large aerial
spraying operations that we trust will
eliminate the enemy. These operations are
being carried on by the provincial government, the federal government and the lumbering interests, each contributing one-third
of the cost. We certainly are hoping to win
the battle of the bud-worm, and that the
invader, the spruce bud-worm, will be
entirely repelled.
Last year the value of our forest products
amounted to $165 million. Our potential output is much greater than that, but we do not
have the markets to absorb it. For that
reason we are very hopeful that some plan
may be worked out for the convertibility of
sterling, because that would again open for
us the market for pit props and long lumber
in the United Kingdom.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Now, although we
have always been dependent on the forests
for our basic prosperity, we have tried to
build up other resources. And obviously we
have had some success, for notwithstanding
that our markets for lumber products are at
a very low ebb, our economy is reasonably
buoyant. However, to develop, we must

1 want yau to continue to be interested in
New Brunswick and ta give us yaur support.
Before closing, 1 wish ta make further reference ta the tremendous help that bas been
given to aur people and aur economy through
the social weifare program instituted by the
government. In this respect I can speak with
the greatest conviction for I[ have been the
Regionai Administrator in the province for
the past six years.
Ail the econumic deveiapments which the
people of New Brunswick have braught
about, with the aid of the federai gavernment, are doing much ta make aur province

It is only when the human dignity of the
individuai is recognized, and his happiness
and security are assured, that aur democratic
way of life can be considered successful.
It is here that I believe wamen can play
a great part. They are usuaily dloser ta
the needs of chiidren and of the aged than

needs, for un their shouiders falis the responsibility for the care of bath the very young

recognize the necessity of praviding for their
happiness and security, but aur resaurces
have been toa iimited ta meet the need.
Federal gavernment programs of famiiy

citizens, give ta those who receive the assistance a sense of security which add-s happiness ta the home and makes ail of aur people

Hanourable senators, I have mentioned
some of the probiems of my province, and
ways by which we are trying ta meet them.
I trust that i bringing these matters ta
your attention I have nat created the impression that I am cancerned about the interests
of oniy one section o! Canada. I am well
aware that each of the other nine provinces
has probiems as great as-some, perhaps,
greater than-those of New Brunswick.
I have been toid that ca-operation and
collaboration are the watchwords of the
Senate. We women should fit into that kind
of program very weii, for I believe with aur
distinguished contemporary, Mrs. Roosevelt,
that women wiii aimost aiways seek ta
ca-operate, whlle men may be more incined
ta seek ta dominate. But none of us can
co-operate in an endeavour ta soive the problems of individuai provinces uniess we are

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I have been more or less champing at the
bit while waiting for all these reports from
the various standing committees to be presented. The first thing I want to do is to
advise the bouse that the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is not
able to be here today, and I have the difficult
task of trying to substitute for him in making
this address on his behalf. I hope you will
bear with me in what I have to say. Honourable senators will know that Mrs. Haig passed
away, on election day. Her death was a
great blow to the senator. A couple of
weeks later he himself suffered an accident
which almost took his life, but I am pleased
to report that when I visited him for two
days in Winnipeg, on my way to Ottawa, I
found him to be on the highroad to recovery.
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: However, he does not
expect to take his place in this chamber
until about the middle of January next, when
it is anticipated that the sittings of the Senate
will be resumed after the Christmas recess.
In the meanwhile I am sure he will be greatly
missed here. I venture to say that for many
years he bas been probably the most active
member of the Senate. He bas faithfully
attended the sittings of this house, and played
an extremely important part in our deliberations. He bas regularly attended also the
meetings of all committees, and over a considerable period he served as Deputy Chairman of the Divorce Committee. When I
return to Winnipeg I shall tell him on behalf
of the members here assembled how much
they have appreciated his services, and that
they extend to him their best wishes for a
very speedy recovery.

NOVEMBER 19, 1953
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, the
other day I had the pleasure of welcoming
our new Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
congratulating him on his appointment to
his high office. Since that time I have personally congratulated the new leader of the
government in this chamber (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), but as I have not congratulated him
publicly I wish to do so right now. Even
bef ore his entry into public life he had a
distinguished career, being a barrister and
solicitor of note in the Brantford area. Soon
after his election to the House of Commons
he took a very prominent part in the work
of that chamber, and some four years ago
became its Speaker. I am told, and I do
think it is generally conceded, that he was
one of the most popular Speakers if not the
most popular, that that house bas had in many
a day.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: So I am sure that, with
that background, he will prove to be a very
capable and congenial leader of the government in the Senate.
Honourable senators, before going further
I should like to congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mrs. Jodoin) and the seconder (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. When I went to
school I studied French for some six years,
but I find that the mover of the Address
speaks much better English than I do French.
She made a splendid speech here yesterdpy,
and I am sure that she will prove a prominent
and useful member of this chamber.
The seconder also made an unusually fine
speech. I was very much interested in all
that she said about the wonderful province
of New Brunswick, including her references
to that great enemy of the forests, the spruce
bud-worm. Her remarks caused me to wonder just what kind of speech I made when I
first came to the Senate, some twenty years
ago; so I looked up Hansard and, lo and
behold, the record showed that I spent all my
time talking about the province of Saskatchewan, with some special references to that
marvelous place called Rosetown, surrounded
by a million acres of arable land, ail under
cultivation-the heart of the wheat belt. So
I can understand the seconder's enthusiasm
in dealing with matters that concern her own
province. When she spoke of the New
Brunswick spruce bud-worm, I could not
help thinking of the grasshoppers, the cutworms, the rusty beetles and the mites of
Saskatchewan. While our wheat crop is
growing, we have to contend with cut-worms,
wire-worms and grasshoppers, and after we

get the wheat into the bins and ready for
market, we then are troubled by rusty beetles,
mites and other pests.
Hon. Mr. Wood: And the C.C.F.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The West, like New
Brunswick, has plenty of difficulties.
While on this point of members speaking
about their own provinces, I would suggest
that all members of this house should visit
provinces other than their own and become
acquainted with the problems confronting
different parts of the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have been a little
delinquent myself; I have not yet visited
Newfoundland, nor the famous province
known as Prince Edward Island, but I hope
to do so.
Hon. Mr. Grant: You are a young man yet.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I hope to visit those
provinces in the near future.
May I here express a welcome to all the
new members who have been appointed to
this chamber? I think they will make a great
contribution in the years that lie ahead. I
was a little disappointed that the Prime
Minister, in his selection of new senators,
did not appoint a lawyer from the far west
or the far east, with the idea that he would
take over the chairmanship of the Standing
Committee on Divorce. In this chamber I
have many times suggested such an appointment, and a few days ago I mentioned it to
the Prime Minister. He is taking it into consideration, and maybe he will appoint someone who will take over the position. In the
meantime, we have secured the valuable services of the honourable senator from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shall thus be relieved
of a great deal of work and responsibility. I
am quite sure that his wide experience as a
lawyer, and his previous experience as
deputy-chairman of the committee, will prove
invaluable to him, and that he will function
to the satisfaction of all of the members of
this chamber.
While I am dealing with the question of
divorce, perhaps I may be pardoned if I
make a statement about my visit to England
last summer. I am not going to speak on
divorce today, although it is a very interesting subject, about which I have made many
speeches in the past. I only wish to say now
that during Coronation week the courts over
there were not sitting, but following the
Coronation ceremonies I visited the High
Court of Justice on several occasions, and

SENATE
even sat in on the hearing of a number of
divorce cases. Two or three or four courts
sit continuously for four or five days a week.
I wanted to find out, if I could, just exactly
how they carry on this work, and if their
methods of procedure were similar to those
of our Standing Committee on Divorce. I
brought with me the Daily Cause List for
May 20, on the back of which I see that one
of the judges heard twenty-two cases that
morning, and another judge in another court
heard twenty-one cases. The average action,
where the allegation was that of desertion,
or cruelty, or incurable insanity, or grounds
of that kind, was disposed of in about eight
minutes. Other cases, where adultery had
to be proven, even though undefended, took
about the same length of time as here,
namely, twenty to twenty-five minutes each.
I thought that information would be interesting to honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. King: You are speaking of a
court with one judge presiding?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes. I would like
to refer next to one or two paragraphs of
the Speech from the Throne. I read the
speech several times, and was rather disappointed, because I think it does not say
enough with respect to what the program of
the government is going to be. But I think
we can all agree with this one paragraph:
The Coronation of our beloved Queen was an
occasion for universal rejoicing. Her devotion to
duty, her personal charm and her happy family
life have assured Her Majesty of a warm place in
the hearts of all her subjects and have strengthened
our attachment te the crown and te the traditions
of our constitutional systern of government.

I think we all agree with those sentiments
100 per cent. Some of us who are here today
were privileged to attend the Coronation.
I, for one, was very much impressed. I had
never seen anything quite so stupendous, nor
had I ever witnessed anything like the
loyalty of many ordinary British subjects,
who slept out in the open, in the rain, for
three days prior to the actual Coronation.
One instance, in particular, that I think I
should mention is this: I was talking to a
young fellow. and he said-of course, he was
carried away by the beauty of the Queen and
the wonderful decorations and trimmings
and things of that nature-he said, "You
know, I hope there will be another war, so
that I can fight for my beautiful Queen".
That was the truly revealing attitude of the
British people. In my opinion there is going
to be a great revival of industry in Britain.
When Elizabeth I became Queen a great
revival set in and Britain surged forward
from that date to become mistress of the
seas and the world's chief trading nation.

I came away from the Coronation feeling
that a similar development is going to take
place in the future. England has another
young Queen-Elizabeth II-and the peoples
of the whole Commonwealth are right behind
her one hundred per cent. I feel that "old
England" will come back and attain her
position of leadership in the world within a
very short period of time.
Another sentence in the speech from the
throne says this:
Our farmers have harvested the second largest
wheat crop in Canadian history.

I was expecting something more than that.
I was expecting the government to tell us
what we were going to do with that crop,
whether we were going to be able to sell it,
or whether we were going to get paid for it,
but there is not a word in the speech that
gives the farmer of the prairie provinces the
least bit of encouragement. It is true that
we have harvested a magnificent crop of
wheat. It has been estimated as high as 600
million bushels; I think the latest estimate is
about 550 million bushels. That is a great
blessing and I, for one, am thankful for such
a bountiful harvest.
I am also thankful that we have other
blessings as well. One of the greatest of
these is that Canada has never been devas'tated by war, a blessing that is perhaps
chiefly attributable to the fact that in the
days of our infancy we had the British fleet
to protect us. And of course besides the
Pacific ocean on the west and the Atlantic
ocean on the east, other factors have been
a cold and barren north, and a friendly nation
to the south.
Another of our blessings is that we have
an abundance of food in this country. Most
of the wars in the past have been brought
on by nations looking for room to grow
food for their peoples. It takes about two and
one-half acres of arable land per capita to
provide the standard of living that we have
in Canada and ithe United States. Many
countries in the world, including England,
China and Japan, have only about onefifth of an acre per capita. Their standard
of living is, therefore, bound to be low, and
in order to better it they must import large
quantities of food.

We produce several times

more food than we need, and we shall be
able, I hope, to find markets for the surplus
that we have on hand as well as for the
surplus products of natural resources that
we are exploiting.
I am sure that all members of this chamber
are thankful for these blessings. They are
not due to the efforts of any political party
or any government.
When I read some
speeches made in another place I am almost
led to believe that the present government is

NOVEMBER 19, 1953
responsible for all of these things. However,
I have not been convinced of that-not yet,
at 'any rate. I give the credit to the Creator.
You will gather, honourable senators, that
I am leading up to a speech on wheat, and
it is on that subject that I intend to make
my chief remarks. First of all, though, I
want to say that food is one of the most
important products in the world, if not the
most important. The population of the world
is increasing by 25 million a year and it is
going to require a lot of food to keep that
population alive and in good health.
There is no food like wheat. You can
store wheat in a bin or granary or elevator,
and keep it there for years and years and
years, and if it is safely housed and dry, it
will sprout and grow crops when eventually
planted; or if it is ground into fiour, that
four will be just as good as can be made
from freshly-harvested wheat. In fact, wheat
was found in King Tut's tomb in Egypt when
it was opened up. At Athabaska Landing,
Alberta, a few years ago I was talking to a
farmer who had won the top award for
wheat at one of the big fairs. Pointing to
a field of wheat, he said, "That has been
grown from wheat which some person gave
me, saying it came from the tomb of King
Tut, who died some 3,200 years ago". The
farmer's wheat had very long heads and long
beards and an Egyptian appearance, but of
course I do not want you to think I was
gullible enough to believe his story. However, the fact remains that wheat can be kept
a very long time and still be perfectly sound
and fit for food.
Honourable senators probably know that
we had an exceptionally large wheat crop in
1951, the largest crop we ever harvested in
1952, and, as previously stated, we have a
crop of some 550 million bushels of wheat
this year. The wheat has been piling up,
with the result that we have at the present
time a crisis. It is, in my opinion, not a
minor crisis, but a major crisis in wheat.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The storage available
in Canada for wheat-and I think the honourable Senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) will be able to bear me out in this
-at terminals, at the lakehead and in the
interior, amounts to 541 million busheln. All
storage space was full before the 1953 harvest of some 550 million bushels of wheat
and huge quantities of coarse grains, with
the result that wheat has been piled up in
every direction. Despite the fact that some
of it has moved since harvest time, the
elevators and granaries on the farms are all
full and we still have on hand in elevators
83280-3

and on the farms some 900 million to a billion bushels. Our seed wheat and domestic
requirements for Canada over the next year
will probably be between 160 million and 200
million bushels, leaving 700 or 800 million
bushels to be disposed of. if the farmers are
to carry on.
Our first problem is to find safe storage for
the wheat on hand. An example of the seriousness of the problem is one pile in the
province of Alberta near the home of my
honourable friend from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Ross), of 100,000 bushels; and I could mention other piles varying from 5,000 bushels to
10,000 bushels. This grain is lying on the
ground, exposed to the weather, with nothing
under it or over it. The farmers have first
to face the problem of storage, if they are to
save this year's crop.
As I have said before, the population of the
world is increasing; and with the possibility
that next year we may not have a good crop,
and perhaps the year after that, it is vitally
important that this year's abundiant harvest
does not spoil. Therefore, our first and foremost problem is to see that our wheat is
properly housed.
Some persons have suggested that additional internal elevators like the ones at
Saskatoon and Moose Jaw should be constructed. But that would be a slow process:
the wheat that is now on the ground could spoil
while additional elevators were being constructed. It has been urged by others that
we should use the airport hangars which are
not in use. There are, I know, a number of
them in Saskatchewan in which wheat could
be properly stored.
In times gone by when there was a surplus,
the elevators would permit farmers to dump
their grain on the ground beside the elevators,
and as soon as a car came in that grain was
loaded into it and shipped out. That arrangement might relieve the situation today, but
the Canada Grain Act makes it an offence.
Any change in that regard would require
an amendment to the Act, and I do not
advise it.
My suggestion is that the farmers should
be encouraged to build granaries to take care
of their wheat crop. I believe a great many
farmers would undertake to provide such
storage if the income tax department allowed
them to write off the cost at a rate of 25
per cent to 50 per cent a year. Honourable
senators will recall that during the war years
certain big corporations, such as the Aluminum Company of Canada Limited, were
encouraged to expand and were allowed to
write off the cost of expansion at the rate
of 50 per cent a year. A concession was made

SENATE
in such cases because the government needed
the companies' products. I see no reason
why a similar concession could not be made
to wheat farmers under present circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could such a concession
not also be made for home builders, so that
human beings, as well as wheat could be
properly housed?.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not worried about
the housing question. Incidentally, the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation sent its
agent to Rosetown to try to persuade the
town to build a huge subdivision that we
never asked for, and which I for one am not
in favour of.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: You might use it to store
wheat.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think money could be
well spent in providing storage for our wheat,
which in my opinion is a very important commodity. It is also my opinion that the piling
up of wheat is the direct responsibility of the
government.
Hon. Mr. Grani: What about the Great
Creator? Was He not in some way responsible
for it?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In September of 1943
the government took over completely the
marketing of wheat in Canada, and this problem of accumulation has come upon us only
since the government entered into the picture.
The government's responsibility stems from
the agreements which they entered into. They
made the British Wheat Agreement, that
famous agreement that we talked so much
about a few years ago; then they entered
into the first International Wheat Agreement,
which many of us opposed. Those agreements
were made at a time when the price of wheat
was high. We argued that the farmers of
western Canada suffered great losses because
of those agreements; there was some dispute
as to the amount, which was placed as high
as $900 million, but I think everyone will
agree that the farmers did lose a lot of
money.
In my opinion the wheat agreements made
by the government have lost us markets.
Under that marketing arrangement we sold
to Britain at one price, and sold Class 2
wheat to other countries at a different price.
The same is truc of the first International
Wheat Agreement: we sold wheat to members
who signed the agreement at a certain price,
and at the same time we sold Class 2 wheat
to the rest of the world at a higher price.
The failure of Great Britain to sign the

second International Wheat Agreement has
had a drastic effect on the marketing of
Canadian wheat.
The net result of the government's interference in the handling of wheat over the
years since 1943 is the loss of markets, reduced prices and a vast accumulation of
surplus grain.
Let us look at what is happening elsewhere.
Sweden is now exporting wheat to Brazil
and Yugoslavia; Turkey is shipping to Germany and Portugal; the United States is
selling for sterling, and is ready to barter
or give away her surplus crop.
All these things I have menitioned have
put the farmers of the prairie provinces in
a very difficult position. I noticed in this
morning's Montreal Gazette an article which
I will not read in full, but from which I will
quote one paragraph:
Farm Income Dips Sharply In Dominion
Farm income in Canada will drop by 12 per cent
in 1953, the second consecutive annual decline from
the 1951 peak, federal agricultural economists
estimated today.

I do not know whether they had in mind
the fact that the farmers will not bc able to
sell the wheat which is stored up and that
therefore their income will be down. At
any rate it is down. About 20 per cent of
our people are agriculturists, but their share
of the national income is only 10 per cent.
The farm population is declining: hundreds
of thousands are moving to the cities, or are
getting work in the mines, where, I am told,
they can earn as much as a member of
parliament. That is the situation, and, to top
it all off, the grain farmers of whom I have
spoken are permitted to deliver only three
bushels per acre of their cultivated land.
What they receive does not provide enough
mroney to pay harvest expenses, store and
gasoline bills, and other outgoings; and as a
matter of fact many a farmer has not been
'able to get elevator space for even this
limited quota. Yet he bas to meet payments
on his machinery and provide for his living
expenses and the costs of putting in next
year's crop. For these reasons the farmer
needs an advance on the wheat which is now
in storage.
I think I have stated in this house on
other occasions that to fully equip an
economic farm unit in western Canada costs
around twenty thousand dollars. A farm
should consist of at least one section, and if
;possible two sections, because the larger
unit can be operated with the same outfit of
m'achinery and equipment as is needed for
one section whereas on the smaller farm the
equipment is lying idle half the time.

NOVEMBER 19, 1953
It may be said that since 1940 the western
Canadian farmers have had good crops.
That is true, and during this period they paid
off a lot of debt and bought machinery to
replace that which had been worn out during
the depression years, when virtually none at
all was purchased. But the cost of the new
machinery was about three times the former
prices, and when it is remembered that between 1935 and 1939 a bushel of wheat was
sold for approximately a dollar, and that the
present price is about $1.90, 'and that articles
which the farmer needs an'd which from
1935 to 1939 could be had for a dollar cost
$2.60 now, it will be seen that the present
price of wheat should be not less than $2.60.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Who will buy it?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: However, we are not
complaining of the price. We have the
bushelage, and we are willing to sell. My
purpose in mentioning these figures is to
show that the price asked by the Wheat Board
is not too high, that we should be getting at
least that amount. Even if it were less, we
have these additional bushels, and the farmers can "take it".
It is my opinion that our farmers would
like to see some action similar to that which
has been taken in the United States. I admit
that the American policy has caused a good
deal of controversy in that -country. The
United States government, which exercises
the powers of our Wheat Board, advances
money to the farmers under the parity price
support fund at 90 per cent of parity-parity
being $2.44 per bushel--provided that the
wheat is in approved storage and has been
inspected by a government inspector and
sealed up. That is what we think should be
done in Canada, except that it would be
unnecessary to seal up the wheat, because
there is no way under the sun that a farmer
could get away with his grain. He could not
sell it, because to sell even a bushel of wheat
it is necessary to produce his quota book. If
the Wheat Board advanced 50 cents a bushel
on stored wheat it would be only on condition that the grower sent in his quota book,
and no wheat -could be sold by him until the
quota book was returned.
It would be
delivered to the elevator, and the elevator
operator would send the board the wheat
ticket when the farmer brought it in to pay
for the advance he received. That would
make the sealing of bins unnecessary.
I am not in favour of a bill on the lines of
the legislation of a year ago. At that time,
when I spoke on the subject, I supported the
passing of legislation by which the farmer
could go to the bank and borrow money and
the government would guarantee repayment.
83280-3j

That system did not work out. The limit was
$1,000; but by the time the bill became law
every farmer I know had marketed at least
a thousand dollars' worth of wheat. In the
whole of the district I come from only one
loan of $1,000 was made. I do not want anything like that to happen again. In any event,
supposing the governrment went into the business of backing these loans, the farmer would
have to pay 6 per cent on his borrowings from
the bank, whereas the Wheat Board can borrow money at 3j per cent or less.
What I advocate is that the government
should advance through the Wheat Board to
the farmers of Western Canada $1 per bushel
on all their wheat that is properly stored.
If such an advance was made on, say, 50 per
cent of the crop, conditions would be greatly
improved.
I think further that the government should
pay the farmers for storing this wheat on
their farms. Let me tell you why. The
honourable senator from Churchill (Ion.
Mr. Crerar) has been in the elevator business
and he knows that fifteen days after a farmer
has put a load of grain in an elevator, the
elevator collects storage fees until the grain
is taken away and sold. At the present time
our elevators are filled with wheat. The
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson) owns a string of elevators, and
his company is receiving payment for storing
wheat and will continue to do so until the
wheat is taken from the company elevators
and sold. This being the case, why shouldn't
the farmers who go to the expense of storing
wheat on their farms be paid regular storage
rates? I have never advocated this step
before, but it seems to me to be a reasonable
proposal. Incidentally, I have no doubt that
the honourable senator from Churchill will
oppose this suggestion when he takes part
in the debate.
Probably honourable senators do not realize
that the farmers of western Canada create
a billion dollars' worth of new wealth on
their farms every year. This money finds its
way to Canadian retailers, wholesalers and
manufacturers and affects the economy of the
whole country. It is very important that
some of the money that is being paid for the
storage of accumulated wheat should come
into the hands of the farmers, for there are
no better and bigger spenders of money than
farmers.
Honourable senators, when coming down
on the train to Ottawa I got into a conversation on football with several people, one of
whom was a retailer, another a wholesaler,
and another a manufacturer. After we got
through debating whether Winnipeg or

SENATE
Edmonton was going to win the championship of Western Canada, I suggested that we
talk about the wheat situation. The retailer
said: "We must find a way to get some money
into the hands of the farmers for all the
wheat that has piled up". I asked him why,
and he told me: "Well, I have had to start
operating on a cash basis. The farmers in
my district owe me some $20,000 and I can't
give them any more credit. I don't know
what they are going to live on". I inquired of
the wholesaler, "What effect has this whole
thing on you?" and he said, "Well, if the
retailer can't sell his goods to the farmer
he won't be buying any goods from us, so
it certainly affects us". Then I put the same
question to the manufacturer, who replied:
"Well, it affects us too. If the retailer can't
sell to the farmer, the wholesaler can't sell
to the retailer, and we shall have to quit
manufacturing our goods".
Honourable senators, I repeat that this
piling up -of wheat is a government responsibility, owing to the fact that the government
took over the complete control of wheat in
September, 1943. In my opinion the present
crisis is the government's own "baby". It
was conceived, born and nourished under
government control. That being the case, if
any risks have to be taken I think the government should take them. However, as I
said before, I do not believe the government
would be taking any risk at all, for even
though they advance money to the farmers
through the Wheat Board, the farmers surrender their quota book and the government
become fully protected, because the wheat
is safely stored away. And it would not
be necessary to seal the bins.
That is all I wish to say about wheat, and
I hope my remarks have not bored honourable senators to distraction.
Before I sit down I should like to tell the
house about some of my experiences in the
Old Country at the time of the Coronation.
These remarks will be in a lighter vein, even
though they have to do with the contentious
problem of taxation. We are heavily taxed
in this country, but let me illustrate how
heavily people in other countries are taxed.
Upon arriving in London we went down to
Canada House and registered. A gentleman
with whom I became acquainted there suggested to me, "Why don't you go over to
Saskatchewan House and register there too?"
I told him that I didn't know there was a
Saskatchewan House, and he said, "Oh, yes;
and you have a very fine gentleman in charge
of it, Mr. Graham Spry". We went down
and met Mr. Spry, a splendid chap, who was
of great assistance to us all during the time
we were in London and overseas. After I

helped him to entertain a gentleman from
Germany who was thinking about building
a textile factory in Regina, Mr. Spry took us
to a pub for dinner. We had a good meal,
and I said, "I think I'l go and buy a cigar".
I saw Mr. Spry smiling, but I didn't realize
exactly what amused him. At the counter
there were several brands of cigars that
appeared to be similar to our White Owl or
Marguerite. Choosing one, I asked what the
price was, and the clerk said, "Sixteen
shillings". I told him I would take the whole
box, and he added, "But, sir, they are sixteen
shillings each". I exclaimed: "What! That
comes to $2.24, does it not?" He agreed that
it did, and went on to tell me that 24 cents
was for the cigar and $2 was the tax.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was content to buy
one cigar and I kept the wrapper as a
souvenir. I intend to show it to the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) some time.
On anothjer occasion I bought some pipe
tobacco. In Canada for thirty-five or forty
cents you can buy tobacco in a pouch, which
you throw away after using the tobacco, and
I was not aware that in the Old Country
tobacco of this kind is sold in tin cans only.
At the cigar counter in the hotel where I was
staying the clerk showed me a can two inches
in height containing, he said, nice mild
tobacco. I pulled out of my pocket a fistful
of shillings, half crowns and other British
coins, saying, "I don't understand your money
too well, so please take the necessary
amount." He replied, "Oh, you haven't nearly
enough there." The price of that can of
tobacco was nineteen shillings, or $2.65. It
was certainly expensive, but I bought it,
anyway. That is just an illustration of the
way smokers in the Old Country are taxed.
I thought honourable senators would like
to know that although we pay heavy taxes
in Canada, the people of other countries are
heavily taxed too.
Honourable senators, there is one other
matter in connection with taxation that I
should like to mention. It has to do with
medical expenses that are deductible for income tax purposes. A Canadian taxpayer used
to be able to deduct all medical expenses
of his dependents and himself in excess of
4 per cent of his taxable income. The percentage was later reduced to 3, but certain
factors were omitted from the new income
tax laws. For example, the cost of eyeglasses
is not allowed as a deduction. Any charge
for false teeth is allowed, because it is on
the dentist's bill. Drug bills, are not allowed,
although in some cases of arthritis poor

NOVEMBER 19, 1953
patients have drug bills amounting to $200
or more a month. Ambulance service fees are
not allowed. In Saskatchewan, we have air
ambulances, in charge of government aviators.
If you want to be brought in from the far
north to a hospital, you send for an ambulance, and you have to pay the fee charged
by the government, but that is not considered
part of your medical expenses. I advocate,
and I would like the Leader of the Government here to advocate, expenditures for eyeglasses, ambulance services, drugs, and all
that sort of thing, be classed as medical
expenses when the income tax amendment bill
is brought down.
In closing, I have one further suggestion to
make. I would ask the Leader of the Government to inquire, and to inform us, how much
government legislation we can expect to have
introduced in this house before Christmas.
In November last year a dozen or more
government bills were initiated here, and we
dealt with them and sent them over to the
other house before we went home for the

Christmas recess. I think that the then
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) strove hard to have those bills placed
before us at that time, and I would suggest
that our present Leader use his influence with
the government to have as much government
legislation as possible initiated here within
the next three or four weeks. Of course,
nearly ail private bills are initiated in the
Senate, but we also like to have as many
public bills as possible brought down for
their primary consideration here. If the
Leader could persuade his colleagues to submit some of their bills for initiation in this
chamber promptly, we could get through with
a lot of work within the next month and help
to speed up the legislative program for the
session.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
November 24, at 3 p.m.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
REQUEST FROM UNITED STATES FOR PERMISSION TO QUESTION IGOR GOUZENKO:
INQUIRY
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I

wish to ask the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a question. The Prime
Minister is expected to make a statement in
the other place either today or tomorrow on
the request from the United States for permission to question Igor Gouzenko. Will our
Leader make a similar statement in the Senate on this issue and, if so, when?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have noticed that a question similar
to the one asked by my honourable friend
was asked in the other place. I shall make
inquiry as to when the question is likely to
be answered there, ýand I think I can assure
honourable senators that I will be in a position to answer the question in this house on
the same day as an answer is given in the
other place.

Hon. Mr. Gouin: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I say, honourable
senators, that in my opinion there bas already
been too much publicity given to 'and too much
fuss made over this question.
WHEAT
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE-QUESTION OF
PRIVILEGE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. M. Aseliine: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I should like to say a few words on a
question of privilege.
Many honourable senators have no doubt
seen the editorial in the Ottawa Journal of
yesterday entitled "That's the Way the Money
Goes", in which I am accused of advocating
that the wheat farmers of Western Canada
be subsidized.
I should like to take this opportunity to
say that in my remarks in the Senate last
Thursday, when I spoke on the wheat question, I made no such suggestion. In my opinion, the editorial was written by someone
who either knows very little about wheat
in the West or deliberately misconstrued my

words. I am not in favour of subsidizing the
wheat farmers in western Canada; in fact, I
am not in favour of subsidies at all.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: The wheat farmers of
western Canada do not want subsiýdies or
handouts; all they want is a fair deal.
What I did say in the bouse last Thursday
was this: In September, 1943, the Government of Canada took over completely the
handling of wheat through the wheat board,
which is the only medium through which the
western farmer can market his wheat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is where we made
the mistake.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Whether we made a
mistake or not, that is the way it stands
today.
The farmer delivers his wheat to the wheat
board at the local elevator; the board pays
the storage on the wheat until such time as
it is sold; it also pays the farmer an initial
payment of $1.21 a bushel for No. 1 wheat.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not wish to interrupt my honourable friend's flow of thought,
but I think he is going a little far on a
question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I want to point out
what I said the other day.
Hon. Mr. Lamber: But you are making a
second speech.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: With leave of the
Senate, I would like to make the matter
clearer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: With leave of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: At the end of the crop
year all the expenses, including the storage
and marketing costs of the wheat board, are
deducted, and a distribution of the balance
is made in the form of a final payment to the
farmer. What I suggested was that when
wheat is stored on the farms the wheat board
should pay the farmers an initial payment
of $1 a bushel on 50 per cent-not the whole,
as suggested by this article-of the wheat so
stored; and that the farmers be paid the
storage charges, just as the line elevators are
paid. This would not cost the taxpayers of
Canada one cent, because at the end of the
year all the expenses would be deducted,
and the price of wheat would have to fall
below 50 cents per bushel before any obligation would fall upon the government.
I think I am entitled to an apology by
this newspaper, and I hope it will print what
I have said today.

NOVEMBER 24, 1953
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR

ADDRESS IN
CONTINUED

REPLY-DEBATE

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 19, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session and the motion of
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This is quite an
important day in my life, because today I am
making my maiden speech in the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is customary in the
other place for a new member, in making his
maiden speech, to thank the electors of his
constituency for having sent him to Ottawa.
Today I want to thank the Prime Minister
for considering me the right type of person to
be summoned to the Senate,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -and more especially
to express my appreciation to him for having
appointed me the government Leader in the
Senate.
I realize what a difficult position I have to
fill. I know that it will be necessary for me
to familiarize myself with and master the
legislation which comes from the other place
and the legislation which is initiated in this
place. There is also a vast amount of committee work; and may I at this time commend
the honourable senators who through the
years have served so well and have contributed so much in the committees on which they
have sat. I shall endeavour to attend as far
as I am able at the committee meetings, to
take an interest in the work of the Senate,
and to give the Senate the leadership which
you would like me to give. I assure you
that I shall do my very best in the interests
of this great chamber.
I realize that the position I now occupy
has been held in the past by brilliant and outstanding Canadians. I have read of their
achievements as members of this chamber,
and I have also read many of their speeches.
We have in this house at the present time
two former Leaders of the Government in the
persons of our Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
and the honourable senator from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King). I served in the House
of Commons when two other great Canadians
led this house. One of them is still living and
one has passed to the Great Beyond. I refer
to the Right Honourable Raoul Dandurand
and the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen.

I repeat that all four of these gentlemen were
great Canadians, and I shall do my best to
follow in their footsteps.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I also take this
opportunity of expressing my very deep
gratitude to all the members of the Senate
for the kindly way in which they have
greeted me in the Red Chamber. I knew that
I had many acquaintances in the Senate, but
I did not know I had so many friends here.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot say how
much I have appreciated the words of greeting and the assurances which I have received
from all members of their support and
assistance, and I wish to inform the house
that I am counting on that support and
assistance. Honourable senators, I shall certainly endeavour to live up to the great trust
which has been reposed in me.
I have also been acquainted with the
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Haig), and I want to join with the acting
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in saying
how sorry we are that his leader's health
prevents him from being with us at this
session. I would join with him in expressing
the hope that his leader will have a speedy
return to perfect health and soon rejoin us
in our deliberations.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: However, the Leader
of the Opposition should be happy in the
thought that the one who is taking his place
in this chamber is indeed well able to fill
that very important position.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I wish to thank the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for
the very kind remarks he made about me un
the opening day, and to tell him of the satisfaction I got from the assurance which he
and other honourable senators gave me of
their co-operation and assistance. During
the past ten years he has served as Chairman
of our very important Standing Committee
on Divorce. The Chairmanship is an onerous
position, one which no honourable member
has sought, and I am sure that the Senate
and the whole country are grateful to him
for the long and devoted services he has
rendered. I also wish to say that I am
happy, as I am sure other honourable senators are, to know that he is being succeeded
in that important position by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: To him and to the
other members of the committee, who have
sat on the committee for long hours most
faithfully, I wish to express our sincere
appreciation.
May I also, at this time, extend a welcome
to the new senators. It might be asked, why
I, a new senator myself, should extend a
welcome to the new senators. I do so, not
only in my position as Leader of the Government here, but also as a parliamentarian who
has served in the House of Commons for the
past eighteen years, and who came over to
the Senate at the beginning of this session
along with the honourable senators from
Cochrane (Hon. Mr. Bradette), Lauzon (Hon.
Mr. Tremblay), De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Fournier) and Kent (Hon. Mr. Léger). Although we are new members of the Senate,
we are also parliamentarians of some years'
standing, and as such we extend a sincere
welcome to the other new members.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was very happy
to learn that amongst the new members there
were three women who, with the honourable
senators from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson)
and Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)-both of
whom have served in this chamber for a
number of years-bring the total number of
women senators to five. In the other house
there are now four lady members; and the
fact that we in the Senate have five is evidence
in one more respect of our being a little ahead
of the House of Commons.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It was indeed a happy
thought on the part of the Prime Minister
that the Speech from the Throne should be
moved and seconded by two of our new
women members; and they both performed
their respective tasks in a manner which did
credit to them personally, and also to this
honourable house.
(Translation):
The honourable senator from Sorel is the
first lady to move the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. By speaking in the
two official languages of Canada, she has
encouraged those among her colleagues who,
like me, speak English only, to try again to
become as thoroughly bilingual as she is.
Further, in her very first speech, she has
proved to her male colleagues that even in
the Senate, it is not good for men to live
alone on earth.
(Text):
The honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who, like many of us,
belongs to the great legal profession is indeed
specially well qualified to sit in this house.

In seconding the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, the
honourable senator made a splendid contribution; she exhibited an interest in not
only the affairs of the home, but in matters
provincial, national and international. In
her concluding remarks she assured us that
she and the other women senators would
co-operate and collaborate with the male
members of the Senate, but she expressed
the fear that the male members might
endeavour to dominate. Let me assure her
that our attitude will be co-operation and
collaboration ever, but domination never.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Earlier this year, it
was my privilege, and that of the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
and others of this chamber, together with
members from the other house, to attend
the beautiful Coronation ceremonies at Westminster Abbey. To describe those ceremonies
adequately would be impossible. I shall
never forget the occasion. We arrived at
Westminster at 7.30 o'clock in the morning
and left at a quarter to three in the afternoon, yet we did not feel that we had been
there for more than a few hours. Every
Assembled at
moment was interesting.
Westminster were representatives from the
commonwealth countries and all the nations
of the world, who had come either to pay
homage or to pledge loyalty to our young
Queen. It was, indeed, a religious and constitutional occasion, which none of us who
were there will ever forget.
Today our Queen embarked on a long
journey to visit many parts of the commonwealth. On this very day she was in Canada.
I understand that the Governor General and
the Prime Minister sent cables to Her
Majesty, wishing her an enjoyable and happy
journey to these far-off lands. I am sure
that all honourable senators will want, at
this time, to express with me their sentiments: to say that we wish our beloved
Queen God-speed. a happy journey and a
safe return to her darling children, the young
Prince Charles and Princess Anne.
Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Since parliament
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
prorogued last May many important events
have taken place in Canada and throughout
the world. One such event in this country
was the general election, the result of which
was, I am sure, generally satisfactory to all
our people, including all honourable senators.
Some Hon. Senators:
An Hon. Senator:

Hear, hear.

That is "stretching it'.

NOVEMBER 24, 1953
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think I am
"stretching it", as an honourable gentleman
has suggested, by including ail honourable
senators. In any event, we are all happy
that the government was returned with an
overall majority, and so does not have to
depend on minorities to remain in power.
To depend upon minorities may be ail right
under certain conditions, but certainly it is
not workable under our system, whereby the
government remains in power only so long
as it has the confidence of the majority of
the House of Commons.
The result of the election, in my mind, was
due to two things in particular. The first was
the magnificent leadership which the government has in our present Prime Minister.
Irrespective of our politics, I feel that we are
all very happy to think that Canada has at
the head of its government a man of such
sterling character, grit, intellect and incredible vitality as the Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent. I also feel that the result
of the election was due to the government's
policies, which met with the approval of a
large-I was going to say majority-a large
number of electors. As to majorities, I read
in the press that the government did not
receive a majority of the votes cast. I believe
the figures show that the Liberal party
received 49-98 per cent of the vote: they
could not get much nearer to the half than
that. The result was indeed a very substantial vote of confidence in the government.
And it is a government of which we can ail
be proud, for not only in Canada, but
throughout the world, it is recognized as an
exceptionally good government. I will not
detain you long on that matter, but I would
like to read the words of the Honourable
Lewis W. Douglas, former United States
Ambassador to the Court of St. James and
President of the Academy of Political Science
who, speaking in New York on November 6
of this year, said:
No country in the civilized community has been
so well governed in the course of the last fifteen
years or more as Canada.

A number of honourable senators have
been kind enough to refer me to a pamphlet
containing extracts from the Hansard reports
of speeches made in 1934 by Senators
Murphy, Dandurand, Meighen and Robinson.
I have read these speeches with interest.
I note that the Honourable Senator
Murphy, speaking in this chamber on March
31, 1934, said:
Let us begin our journey through the records of
parliament with the year 1868. Few subjects have
been more frequently discussed in this chamber
than that of securing for it a greater volume of
legislative business. Scarcely had the first parliament after Confederation got into working order
when it was felt that under the then existing
parliamentary procedure, something should be done
to originate more bills in the Senate.

That was back in 1868.

He continues:

Accordingly, in 1868, a select committee was
appointed to "consider and report whether by any
alterations in the forms and proceedings of this
bouse the dispatch of public business can be more
effectively performed" and that committee, through
its chairman, Sir Alexander Campbell, presented
its report on May 7, 1868.

In this same pamphlet the Honourable
Raoul Dandurand is quoted as follows:
Since 1867 it bas been a standing grievance of
the Senate that we are idle for months and then
overwhelmed with legislation. I recognize that a
laudable effort has been made by my right bonourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to alter
this unsatisfactory condition, and that to a certain
degree he has succeeded. It may be urged that
since there bas been no substantial improvement,
there is no cure.

And the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen,
speaking on March 8, 1934, stated:
It is little less than a travesty that this chamber,
prepared for work, ready to serve the people of
this country should be compelled to wait more or
less idly for weeks, perhaps for months, while
discussions, which are no doubt necessary under
any democratic system, are proceeding in the other
chamber, and that a plethora of legislation should
be thrown at us in the latter part of each session,
when we have no opportunity to do what
we ought to do in the way of reviewing it.

So this has been a burning question over
the years. But I can assure honourable
senators that although greater men than I
have failed to bring more legislation earlier
to the Senate, that fact will not deter me
from making a further effort.
I was also very much interested in the discussion which took place the other day in
the committee for the selection of committee
chairmen, on the question of more publicity
for the Senate. I thought that was a new
subject too, but I find that it also has been
a live question for a long time.

That is my evidence.
The other day the acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) asked me to
endeavour to persuade the government to
initiate more legislation in this chamber, and
to do so promptly. I thought it was a novel
suggestion, and a very good one. However,
upon reading the debates of this house over
the years I find that the Senate has always
complained that it received practically no
work at the beginning of a session, but that
towards the end, in the very closing days, a

place.
83280-4

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As the honourable
senator from Waterloo suggests apparently
there is nothing new under the sun. I find that
on March 15, 1934 the Honourable Senator
Robinson made these remarks:
Much has been said on the question of the
publicity of our debates. Naturally the activities
of the Senate do not commend themselves to the
notice of the newspapers of the dominion as much
as does the work of the other chamber, but possibly
the Senate itself is in a measure to blame for this
lack of interest in its proceedings. It seems to me
that we should not take a fault-finding attitude
but should try to initiate something to make use
of the power we have and to do work which will
commend itself to the newspapers.

Speaking the other day, the acting Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) spent
a considerable portion of his time in discussing the matter of wheat. I am sure he did
not wish to give the impression that the
prairie farmers of Canada are hard up. I do
not think one would necessarily get that
impression from his speech, and I want to
make it clear that I do not believe he gave
that impression. However, I gather from
what I have heard outside this house that
many of our citizens believe the western
farmers are financially embarrassed. I shall
endeavour this afternoon to show that that
is not so, and I think it is important to
Canada and to the western farmers themselves that this wrong impression should be
corrected. I have also gathered that there
is an impression that very little grain has

been exported from Canada this year. My
information is that that is not so, that the
exportation of coarse grains, oats and barley,
is greater than it was in 1952, and also that
from August 1 to November 4 of this year
80 million bushels of wheat have been
exported, as compared with 108 million
bushels in the corresponding period of last
year. Statistics covering the exportation of
all grains shows that the comparative
decrease is only 19 million bushels. It is
true that the farmers have a great deal of
wheat on hand, and that our elevators are
filled. But this is due in only a small
measure to a reduction of grain exports.
Never in our history has so much grain been
sold so rapidly as during the two crop years
which ended last July 31. Nor, be it noted,
is this excess of grain on farms and in elevators the result of an increase of acreage. The
fact is that the acreage this year is practically the same as it was twenty years ago.
That there is so much wheat in Canada
today is due almost entirely to the
phenomenal yields which gracious Providence
has made possible over the last three years.
As honourable members know, in 1952 the
wheat crop was the largest ever harvested in
Canada; in 1953 the second largest crop was

harvested; and 1951 was our fourth largest
crop year. I do not need to remind honourable senators that it is most unusual for one
bumper crop to follow another. According
to my recollection, in days gone by it was
usual to have a bumper crop followed by a
medium crop; then, probably, some very
poor crops, and over a period of time another
bumper crop. So I repeat that it is doubtful
whether Canada has previously had two
bumper crops in succession, and I am sure
that never before have there been three
bumper crops, one after the other; and for
these crops we should indeed be grateful.
In the past Canada has disposed of her
crops, and I have no doubt she will dispose
of them in the future. At the present time
we are getting a fair share of the British
market, in fact a share equal to that of any
peacetime year. We are all happy in the
knowledge that this country has some of her
best salesmen in the United Kingdom, the
continent of Europe, the Far East, and Latin
America, endeavouring to sell -our wheat. I
do not say the task is an easy one; it is
difficult; however, sales are being effected,
and I am sure that under the dynamic direction of Canada's Minister of Trade and Commerce, the Right Honourable C. D. Howe, we
can look forward with confidence to the
future.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Let me say a word
about the financial position of our western
farmers. It may be interesting to know that
the income of the prairie producers during
the period 1945-52 aggregated $5,781 million,
or an average annual income of $722,600,000.
The estimated income of the prairie producer
for the year 1953 is $1,104 million, which is,
I believe, a record. It will therefore be
seen that during the present year, in spite of
the fact that the farmers have a very large
amount of wheat on hand-and that, I
emphasize, is a very valuable asset-they
will receive $381,400,000 more than their
average over the last eight years.
That,
surely, is a very substantial increase.
What is the position of the western farmer
in respect of indebtedness?

I find that his

heaviest load of debt existed in 1935; but I
will take the year 1937 as a starting point,
there having been in the two-year interval a
considerable improvement. I have had an
opportunity to see the report which was made
by Gilbert Jackson and Associates. For a
number of years Mr. Gilbert Jackson was a
professor of economics at the University of
Toronto: he is recognized as one of our leading economists; in fact he ranks with the
leading economists of the world. According

SENATE
All honourable senators regret the absence
through illness of the honourable senator
from Winnipeg, the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig). Even temporarily his place
is not easy to fill, but the honourable senator
Srom Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has
already shown, in his first speech as acting
Leader of the Opposition, that the position
will be filled worthily and with fairness of
judgment in matters which concern the welfare of the country.
To the mover and seconder of the Address
in reply to the speech from the Throne, the
honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mrs.
Jodoin) and the honourable senator from
Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), may I
offer my sincere congratulations upon their
respective appointments. Both these ladies
and the honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Hodges) have served in public
life over a period of years, and will continue to serve the public in the different field
of activity which lies before them. In this
regard we, their colleagues, are to be congratulated that these ladies have joined our
ranks. To these and the other newly-appointed senators, we extend a sincere and
hearty welcome.
As a representative of Saskatchewan, I
should like to discuss two matters which
especially concern my part of the country,
namely, wheat and gas.
Speaking before this house for the first time
in 1949, I drew attention to the wheat situation then existing. Even at that time there
was evidence of wheat accumulating in
the United States and Canada. The accumulation has continued steadily and, according
to a report I have before me, issued by the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, this present
year has shown a 22 per cent increase over
last year's world wheat supply, or more than
the amount of wheat produced in Canada in
one year, if we take a ten-year average.
At that time I pointed out how the Second
World War had eliminated many of our wheat
markets-now behind the Iron Curtain. Certainly the recent food riots in East Germany
indicate that if we could trade as freely now
as before the war, wheat surpluses would
quickly disappear. Recent reports coming
out of Russia and ber satellites show their
war industries to be top-heavy and their
agricultural production far short of the
peoples' need.
What is the situation regarding wheat in
those countries of Asia and Eurone at present
available to us as markets? If I am not mistaken, the governments of France and England
are guaranteeing a price for their farmers'
wheat higher than the price our growers
receive and, at that, the wheat is of a poorer
quality. It is only in recent months that

the English miller has been permitted to mix
more than 20 per cent hard wheat with the
soft wheat grown in England or imported
from other European countries and from
sterling areas. It should be mentioned, however, that there is an understanding, though
not a regulation, that because of the dollar
shortage, the miller will not take advantage
of this relaxation for the time being, but
will maintain the 20 per cent proportion as
in the past.
While in London this summer I met one
of the Queen's representatives from Pakistan
and had a talk with him about the tragic
drought in his country last year. More
recently, at a small luncheon gathering, we
heard the High Commissioner for Pakistan
speak at some length on conditions in his
country. He asked us to visualize 80 million
people living in an area about the size of
Saskatchewan, still using, for the most part,
ancient methods of farming and making a
valient effort to meet their own needs by
building irrigation projects and mechanizing
their farms. He also spoke of last year's
drought, and mentioned that they had bought
$30 million worth of Canadian wheat, pointing out at the same time that this expenditure of $30 million would mean a lengthy
delay in at least one of their irrigation
projects.
I have mentioned Pakistan especially
because that country could, in time, with
the successful completion of their irrigation
and mechanizing program, become a serious
competitor of ours in the production of hard
wheat. I understand that in the year before
the drought they did export large quantities
of hard wheat in order to get dollars for
their irrigation projects.
India had a similar drought problem last
year which was met by purchases of wheat
and by gifts from producing countries, as
well as assistance under the Colombo Plan.

Japan, for instance, or even in China in
recent years, where the necessities of war
brought about many changes.
Last year Japan was faced with the problem of a rice shortage and, though I have
not the accurate figures before me, I believe
they purchased about 20 million bushels of
our No. 5 wheat, which they used in combination with rice and starch to make
synthetic rice.

than the revenue from all the gas we could
sell to eastern Canada in the next five years.
I do not know of any honourable member
in this or the other house who has not been
concerned over the recent talk of trade
barriers against many of our products entering the United States, and yet it is being
advocated that we should not permit gas to
come into this country from across the
border. Should we be a party to a trade
war or should we accept the goods of other
nations so that we may trade with all parts
of the world? This should apply, I think, to
gas or any essential commodity. After all,
trade operates on a two-way street.
I should like honourable members to know
that I ;am not opposed to a Canadian route
for gas, nor am I concerned about this matter
for personal reasons. I have no investment
in any gas venture as such, but I do realize
that, for any all-Canadian route carrying gas
to eastern Canada, we on the prairies will
pay a larger proportion of the cost than
should be ours.
In this house, upon several occasions, I
have spoken of the situation regarding gas,
and am still firmly of the opinion that we
should, wherever possible, serve our own
people first. However, any surplus gas-and
there is certainly plenty -of it-could be
directed to, say, the middle of the continent,
to Minneapolis and St. Paul, which together
constitute a market as large as Toronto.
In parts of Wisconsin, and in Detroit there is
-and probably, in time, in Quebec and in
other parts of Ontario there will be-a
market for more gas. We might make an
exception of the city of Toronto which could
import its gas from the Tennessee Pipe Line
and, within five years, serve its citizens at
about two-thirds of the price they would be
obliged to pay for gas brought from western
Canada. Toronto is a large industrial city
and, only by having cheap fuel and cheap
power, can its industries meet the competition across the border and other parts of
the world.
The Tennessee Pipe Line Company has
made a firm contract with the Consumers'
Gas Company of 53.6 cents per one thousand
cubic feet, whether the load is 9 per cent
of the line's capacity or 90 per cent, which
latter is considered a full load. Trans-Canada Pipe Lines' original suggested price is
55 to 57 cents for a full load. Other charters
for the same route have not quoted a price.
Honourable senators will realize that it may
take between five and ten years to develop
the full capacity of a pipe-line serving eastern
Canada. If Trans-Canada Pipe Lines or
others are able to start with not more and
possibly less than 45 or 50 per cent capacity

load, they cannot hope to deliver gas to
Toronto for less than 70 cents per one thousand cubic feet, as against the 53.6 cents
for gas from Louisiana regardless of the size
of the load. And, at 70 cents per thousand
cubic feet, gas cannot compete with any
other type of fuel. I doubt if capital could
be secured to finance a pipe line from western
Canada to the Toronto market and wait ten
years for dividends. A recent estimate of
cost of an all-Canadian line was $320 million-many millions more than the original
estimate upon which I have based the above
figures of the cost of bringing gas by an
Moreover, the prices

quoted are prices to the distributors; what
the consumer would pay, I would not know.
We must take the long view of this whole
situation affecting gas and arrange to dispose
of our present surplus gas to parts of North
America where there is immediate need. My
feeling is that any all-Canadian gas line will
have to be built in two parts. In the first
stage a line would be built to Regina and
Winnipeg and continue to Minneapolis and
St. Paul and other points. In the second
stage eastern markets may be built up at a
later date when facilities have been developed to meet the larger demand. If something is not done in this regard there is reason to fear that oil development in western
Canada will be seriously retarded. Many
firms with large holdings involving both gas
and oil hesitate to drill these properties,
knowing that in some cases the gas will have
to be wasted in order to get the oi. And the
government of Alberta will not permit this
unavoidable waste. They are as concerned
as anyone else about selling gas to their own
citizens and to the rest of Canada, but they
do not wish to be penalized in so doing.
In Saskatchewan, vast quantities of gas are
being developed near the city of Regina,
where I live. It would not be surprising if
some company stepped in and supplied the
city with gas from adjacent territory. It
could be done easily and with a small pipeline, thus making it more costly for the
longer pipe-line across Canada.
Honourable members, may I draw to your
attention an important and inescapable consideration in this matter? The American
investment in Canadian oil, gas and pipe-line
development is in excess of half a billion
dollars. Without this huge investment, I
doubt very much if at the present time we
would have need to discuss the question of
exporting our oil or gas anywhere. Our
worry would be how -and from where we
might import gas -and oil. Over 55 per cent
of the money invested in western Canada's
oil and gas development came from the

NOVEMBER 24, 1953
United States, and I am quite sure that the
United States government, through tax concessions, has had a hand in developing oil
and gas reserves in western Canada, having
in mind the remote but not impossible contingency of another war.
While on this subject, I should like to speak
briefly about oil. It is expected that within
three years we shall produce in Canada
sufficient for our own need, which is expected
to reach the figure of 500 thousand barrels a
day. Up to seven years ago all our oil had
to be imported, principally from the United
States. If it were necessary now to import
500 thousand barrels a day, it would mean
an expenditure of about $400 million a year.
Consider what this would mean to Canada
and our adverse balance of trade with the
United States at the present time.
Another important consideration is that we
shall have to sell some of our cil to the
United States, for we cannot compete with
the sale of oil from eastern United States if
we must send Canadian ail much farther east
than Toronto and surrounding territory. It
is a great deal cheaper to bring it by water
route and pipe-line from the east coast into

Montreal to serve the eastern markets. So,
some place along the line we shall have to
make a compromise with the United States,
in that they will purchase our surplus cil and
gas in western Canada, and that we will
purchase American cil and gas from the eastern United States for eastern Canada.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
REQUEST FROM UNITED STATES FOR
PERMISSION TO QUESTION IGOR
GOUZENKO-TEXT OF
CORRESPONDENCE

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, yesterday the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) asked
me if I would make a statement with respect
to the request of the United States of
America for permission to question Igor
Gouzenko. Four notes have passed between
the State Department of the United States
and the Canadian Embassy at Washington.
These notes are dated respectively October
29, 1953; November 4, 1953; November 19,
1953, and November 25, 1953. I think the
best way to answer the inquiry of the honourable senator would be to table copies of
these notes. If honourable senators so desire,
I would be pleased to read them.
Some Hon. Senators: Read them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The first note, dated
October 29, 1953, is from the State
Department to the Canadian Embassy in
Washington:
The Secretary of State presents his compliments
ta His Excellency the Ambassador of Canada and
bas the honour ta advise that the Department of
State has been informed by Mr. Robert Morris,
Counsel for the Senate Internal Security SubCommittee, of his desire ta interview Mr. Igor
Mr. Morris has further
Gouzenko in Canada.
inquired of the Department of State how such an
interview could be arranged. He has been informed
that his request would be submitted ta the Government
of
Canada
through
its
Embassy
in
Washington.
Mr. Morris desires the Department ta mention
that he has noted the publicly expressed desire of

Mr. Gouzenko to talk ta the Senate Internal Security Sub-Committee and that the Chairman of this
Committee, Senator William E. Jenner, considers
this offer ta be valuable.
It would be appreciated If the Department of
State might be informed concerning the reply the
Canadian Government desires ta be made ta Mr.
Morris on this matter.

The reply to that note was sent on November 4, 1953, by the Canadian Embassy at
Washington to the State Depar~tment. It
reads as follows:
The Ambassador of Canada presents his compliments ta the Secretary of State and, in reply ta his
note of October 29 transmitting a request from Mr.
Robert Morris, Counsel for the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee ta interview Mr. Igor
Gouzenko in Canada, has the honour ta state as
follows:
1. Apparently Mr. Morris' wish ta interview Mr.
Gouzenko arises from the fact as stated in your
note of October 29 that he has "noted the publicly
expressed desire of Mr. Gouzenko ta talk ta the
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee".
This
presumably refers ta a statement attributed ta Mr.
Gouzenko in an article in the Chicago Tribune that
he had some further information.
2. Before this request had been received from
Mr. Morris, Mr. Gouzenko had already been questioned concerning his alleged statement since, if
there had been any additional information, it
should have been given ta the Canadian authorities. Mr. Gouzenko, however, denies that he has
any further information beyond what was reported
in the Royal Commission's report.
3. Mr. Gouzenko states that he has been misquoted by the Chicago Tribune and denies both the
alleged remarks concerning additional information
and the alleged criticism of the handling of the
case or the use of the information derived from it.
4. Under these circumstances, it is presumed that
the reasons for Mr. Morris' request ta interview
Mr. Gouzenko have disappeared.
5. All information connected with this case which
could be of value ta the United States Government
was promptly transmitted without delay as soon as
it was available.

The next note is from the State Department
to the Canadian Embassy in Washington
dated November 19, 1953.
It reads as
follows:
The Secretary of State presents his compliments
ta His Excellency the Ambassador of Canada and
has the honour ta refer ta the Ambassador's note
No. 807 of November 5 with regard ta the request
of Mr. Robert Morris, Chief Counsel for the
Internal Security Sub-Committee of the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, ta interview Mr. Igor
Gouzenko in Canada.
The information in the Ambassador's note was
conveyed ta the Chief Counsel for the Internal
Security Sub-Committee, but its chairman, Senator
William E. Jenner, has now written ta the Secretary
of State that "there are certain facts on espionage
in the United States (originating with Gouzenko)
now in the record of the Internal Security SubCommittee which do not appear in the report of
the Canadian Royal Commission". Senator Jenner
attached ta his letter ta the Secretary a SubCommittee press release of November 7, 1953,
containing the text of the previous exchange of
notes between the Secretary of State and the Canadian Ambassador on this subject, with comment
by Mr. Morris, including the following:
"Certainly the excerpt in the secret security
memorandum of 1945, which has become known as

SENATE
the 'Nixon memorandum' concerning the fact that
the secretary to the Secretary of State Stettinius
was a Soviet agent, was not in the report of the
Royal Commission.
There are also other statements in that same
memorandum which likewise were not published
in the Royal Commission's report."
In view of the foregoing, Senator Jenner has
asked the Secretary of State to renew to the Canadian Government the sub-committee's request that
Mr. Gouzenko be made available for questioning
by the sub-committee.

That note was answered by the Canadian
Embassy in a note to the State Department
dated November 25, 1953, which reads:
The Ambassador of Canada presents bis compliments to the Secretary of State and bas the honour
to refer to bis note of November 19, 1953, concerning the request of Senator William E. Jenner,
Chairman of the Internal Security Sub-Committee
of the United States Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, that the Canadian Government make
Mr. Igor Gouzenko available for questioning by the
sub-committee.
Careful consideration bas been given to this
request, taking into account the special responsibility
which the Canadian
Government
bas
assumed for Mr. Gouzenko's protection and the
arrangements which have been made to provide a
new identity for him, bis wife and bis family.
Mr. Gouzenko bas been given the rights of
Canadian citizenship and he is, therefore, at liberty
to give bis views on any question to anyone in
Canada or the United States. He naturally must
consider for himself the effect of bis actions on the
special measures that have been taken in bis own
interest and at bis request, to protect bis security
and to conceal bis identity.
The Canadian Government fully appreciates the
importance of full and close co-operation between
Canada and the United States in exchanging
information important to the national security of
both countries. All information without any exception, which was provided by Mr. Gouzenko to the
Canadian Government, bas always been made
available to the competent United States authorities
as it became available to the Canadian authorities.
Moreover, the facilities have been extended to the
United States authorities to clarify any point arising out of Mr. Gouzenko's evidence or views.
In this connection, the Federal Bureau of Investigation bas had access to Mr. Gouzenko as and
when requested.
Mr. Gouzenko bas, in fact,
been interviewed on the F.B.I.'s behalf on a
number of occasions, the latest date being August,
1950. This bas been the situation since 1945 and
remains the situation now.
The material secured in this way by the F.B.I.
included information which was not made public
in the report of the Royal Commission because
such information related to activities outside Canadian territory which was not relevant to that
report.
In addition to the facilities used and available
to the F.B.I., the Secretary of State will recall that
in May, 1949, the United States Government
requested the Canadian Government to arrange for
representatives of the Immigration Sub-Committee
of the United States Senate Committee on the
Judiciary to interview Mr. Gouzenko confidentially
in relation to the Sub-Committee's examination of
specific questions relating to immigration procedures.
The Canadian Government made the
necessary arrangements and the interview with
Mr. Gouzenko took place under Canadian auspices
in the presence of a member of the United States
Embassy and two representatives of the Sub-Committee. Mr. Gouzenko's evidence included general
statements on the operation of Soviet espionage

networks, as well as such information as he had
concerning operations in the United States. This
interview revealed no information which had not
already been made available by the Canadian
authorities
to
the
competent
United
States
authorities.
The note of November 19 from the Secretary of
State refers to a "secret security memorandum of
1945". The memorandum referred to was apparently prepared by and is in the possession of the
United States authorities. The Canadian Government is unaware what information is contained in
this memorandum.
In so far, however, as the
excerpt from it in the Secretary of State's note
which refers to a United States official is concerned, all such information from Mr. Gouzenko's
testimony was conveyed to the F.B.I. through their
representative in Ottawa.
As stated in the note addressed by the Canadian
Embassy in Washington to the State Department
on November 4, 1953, Mr. Gouzenko bas denied to
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that he bas
any further information to communicate.
It is in the light of the foregoing considerations
that the Canadian Government bas examined the
second note of the Secretary of State on this
matter. It is noticed that whereas the first note
forwarded a request of the Senate Internal Security
Sub-Committee to interview Mr. Gouzenko in
Canada, the present request of the Chairman is that
be be made available for questioning by the SubCommittee.
The Canadian Government believes that there bas
already been ample opportunity for Mr. Gouzenko
to give information and make known bis views to
the United States authorities through established
channels. Nevertheless, in view of the second note
from the State Department, the Canadian Government is willing, if Mr. Gouzenko agrees, to make
arrangements for a confidential meeting, under
Canadian auspices, at which any person designated
by the United States Government could be present,
it being understood, as it was in 1949, that the
evidence or information thus secured would not be
made public without the approval of the Canadian
Government.

These four notes will appear in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators may
I be permitted to ask a question arising out
of what has just been read? I listened very
carefully and, unless I am wrong, I take it
that the whole incident arose, in the first
instance, because of a newspaper account
appearing in the United States, to the effect
that Mr. Gouzenko had said he was willing
and anxious to appear before the United
States Senate committee. My question is
this: Has a check been made to find out if
Mr. Gouzenko did say that, and, if not, how
it got into the American press?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information as to whether or not he did say it. In
fact, I have no further information than is
contained in the notes that have been forwarded by the representatives of the Canadian Government at Washington to the
American State Department.

NOVEMBER 25, 1953
DISABLED PERSONS
PROPOSED ASSISTANCE PROGRAM-INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
wish to direct a question to the honourable
leader, and perhaps it may be taken as a
notice of motion. In answer to a question
in the other house the Minister of National
Health and Welfare stated yesterday that
seven provinces had agreed to co-operate
with the federal government in the proposed
dominion-provincial program for assisting
disabled persons. My question is: Which
seven provinces are these?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will endeavour to
obtain the information and give it to the
honourable senator as soon as possible.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I think it would be to the benefit of all
concerned if, in accordance with our custom,
an inquiry of that kind were placed in
writing.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am starting no new precedent; I have made inquiries orally before.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS

IN REPLY-DEBATE

CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators, may I, first of all, congratulate His
Honour the Speaker on his appointment to
the high office which he now holds. I would
also like to say to our new Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that we
appreciate the skill with which he has commenced his duties in this house. We know
that he will live up to the high traditions of
his office, and we assure him that he has
our highest regard and loyalty.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The leader of the Conservative party in this bouse (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has met with sorrow and suffering: sorrow at
the sudden death of his wife, and suffering
from a personal accident. We can only hope
that in the near future he will be able to
return to his seat in this house.
I wish to offer my congratulations to the
mover (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) and the seconder
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) of the Address and, in
a very humble way, to express to them and
to the other new senators a hearty welcome.
As senators they will be able to make a real
contribution to the welfare of Canada. They

will find in this chamber very little partisanship. It is true, however, that occasionally
the division bell rings; but in my time at least
-and I understand it has been the experience
of others who have been here longer than I
have-divisions have never taken place along
party lines.
In the short time at my disposal this afternoon I should like to discuss only the subject
of national health. I particularly want to
stress the benefits which the Trans-Canada
Medical Plan offers to the people of this
country.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare has become one of the big branches
of government; great interest is being taken
in the ever-expanding social security program
and in the steadily-progressing plan for medical care. In this High Court of Parliament,
through the press and at meetings of organizations the question is often asked, "When is
Canada going to have a national health insurance scheme?"
As a further indication of the interest taken
in this subject the Conservative party, in the
last federal election campaign, advocated a
voluntary system of health insurance by which
the doctor-patient relationship would be
maintained. The C.C.F. party made national
health insurance a plank in their campaign
platform, and they brought forward a petition
signed by 100,000 people demanding an allembracing health scheme which would provide medical, surgical, mental, obstetrical,
optical and other care to the people of Canada, regardless of income.
Recently the Trades and Labor Congress,
with a membership of 560,000, held a convention at which a resolution was passed
demanding a system of national health insurance which would give all the benefits
I have mentioned, plus hospitalization and
psychiatric treatment. The president of that
organization even proposed that under such
a scheme the doctor should be paid a salary,
instead of being on a fee-for-service basis.
I am bound to say that an arrangement such
as that would not be acceptable to the Canadian Medical Association; and even if it
were, it would be a most difficult policy to put
into operation. Doctors differ in their training, in the instruments and equipment they
require to carry on their practice, in their
experience and indeed in their inclination to
work long hours. Further, conditions change
from locality to locality. It would, therefore,
be almost impossible to work out a salary
arrangement for doctors. If health insurance
were brought in and the doctors paid on a
fee-for-service basis, a schedule of fees for
the various services would have to be set
down and agreed to by all parties.

SENATE
There bas been much discussion about the
attitude of the Canadian Medical Association
towards national health insurance. I should
like to point out that the association has
approved the principle of a health insurance
plan, and its members are willing to cooperate in any scheme which will benefit the
health of the people generally. The doctors
have pointed out that adequate nutrition,
good housing and proper working conditions
all have a great influence on the ravages of
disease on the human body. Further, they
stress that they do not want to do anything
that will in any way lower the rapidly rising
standards of medical practice. They do,
however, want to see in Canada a health plan
which will enable every man to insure himself
and his family against unpredictable costs
for medical and hospital care.
Sickness insurance is nothing new. As
long ago as 1883 Bismarck introduced such
a system into Germany. A compulsory insurance scheme became operative in Austria
in 1888, in Hungary in 1891, and in Britain
and in Northern Ireland in 1911. In fact,
at the present time there are throughout the
world nine countries with voluntary health
insurance schemes and at least tbirty-two
with compulsory schemes.
Before a national health plan could become
operative in Canada, our constitution would
require that certain preliminary steps be
taken. For instance, under a federal plan
every province would have to agree to be
included, and such points as a token payment for services would have to be considered. The provinces of British Columbia
and Alberta already provide hospital accommodation, but under their plans the patient
is required to pay a small part of the hospital
cost, namely, $1 a day. The people of Great
Britain have recently been asked to pay a
certain amount for medicines. Such token
payments go a long way towards reducing
the premium covering the cost of the service. And so long as the required payment
is small enough not to deter anyone from getting proper attention it bas the additional
advantage of maintaining a measure of selfreliance on the part of the person receiving
the service.
Social security falls into two divisions:
social insurance and social assistance. Social
insurance stems from away back. In the
days of the Roman Empire some attempts
were made to provide social security; and
down through the ages people have felt they
should save a little money when they are
well to pay expenses when they are sickthat they should, as it were, provide a little
something for a rainy day, so that if disaster
comes they will not be on charity.

I have thought, honourable senators, that
it might be a good idea for our Standing
Committee on Public Health and Welfare to
investigate the whole national health problem. Out of such an investigation I believe
would come a decision to expand the scope
of the Trans-Canada Health Plan. This
non-profit plan, which has been worked out
by the Canadian Medical Association, provides all the types of prepaid medical care
I have mentioned. It is in operation now in
nine provinces. The benefits vary from province to province, but a director has now been
appointed to try to make them uniform, to
adjust them to what the people wish to pay
and to provide that a person who moves
from one province to another shall be able
to continue his membership. Groups may
join this organization. In such cases every
individual member is given a card, which
is shown to the doctor when medical care
is required. That is all that is done in regard
to payment. The patient-doctor relationship
is maintained, and the patient can go to the
doctor of his choice. This plan is very
popular among the doctors, and people who
receive its benefits are some of its strongest
supporters. The number of members insured
under this plan is rapidly increasing. Each
member pays a premium, and there may be
some people, particularly in the lower-income
brackets, who would need help in making
the payment: if so, that could be undertaken
by some taxing body.
Hospital accommodation is very, very expensive today. This is a different branch
of medical care, but a very important one.
The "Blue Cross" Hospital Plan offers
insurance in this field and, as I mentioned,
two of the western provinces provide hospital
accommodation through an insurance scheme.
For the past six years Saskatchewan has had
a compulsory scheme of this kind. The
annual rates of payment there are: for an
adult $15, for a child under 18 years $5,
and for a family not more than $40. Of
course, these payments do not cover the
whole cost. The 1952 rates, which were a
little lower than these, brought in a revenue
of only $6 million, whereas the total cost
was $15 million. The difference was made
up by general taxation and resulted in an
increased rate of some 2 mills on the assessed
value of property in the province. However,
that matter is being looked into. Moreover,
as I have gaid, hospital accommodation is a
separate btanch.
We do not know what it would cost to
inaugurate a national health insurance
scheme. The figure of $600 million has been
mentioned. We do know that $373,800,000
is now being spent for medical and hospital

NOVEMBER 25, 1953
services. Of that amount 25 per cent is
already being paid into the prepaid medical
and hospital schemes; another 25 per cent
goes to the doctors, 19 per cent for medicines,
12 per cent for hospital care, 9 per cent for
the dentists and the balance for other
services.
Five years ago a national health plan was
announced by the dominion government.
Since then $100 million has been handed, over
to the provinces for health purposes. In
fact, some 46,000 additional hospital beds
have been provided, and some 144 communities have hospital accommodation which
they did not have before. This is a fortunate
condition, because nothing is more frustrating, medically speaking, than to have a really
sick patient for whom no hospital accommodation is available and who may have to
wait for days or weeks to get hospital
space.
Under the program of the last five years
a renewed attack has been made upon such
things as mental illness, tuberculosis and
cancer. In the words of the Minister of
National Health and Welfare, the Honourable
Paul Martin:

recognized as a very good investment; and
the type of insurance which the TransCanada Medical Plan provides should appeal
to all the people of Canada: it seems to me
that it offers the best means of promoting
the national health.
In every country of the world, under every
economic system, the search continues for
some policy which will bring about conditions
whereunder every individual can lead the
good life, with al that it involves; wherein
every person shall have the very minimum
of suffering and distress. It seems to me that
better medical and hospital care is a step
towards that ideal. The closer we can come
to that ideal, the more effectual are likely to
be our efforts to induce other countries to
adopt the democratic system of government.
The end and aim of legislation, of course, is to
improve conditions among the people; and the
closer we can come to this ideal, the more joy
and happiness there will be in our homes,
and the more effectual will be our efforts to
hold back that rising tide of communisn
which has already engulfed a third of the
peoples of the world.

SENATE
The honourable acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), in his fine speech
last week, mentioned that the honourable
senator from Fredericton, in seconding the
Address in reply, devoted most of her remarks
to ber native province. He then admitted
that his own first speech in this chamber pertained principally to the affairs of his adopted
province of Saskatchewan. And it is interesting to note that the honourable senator from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood), in his speech yesterday, referred mainly to wheat and natural
gas, matters that particularly concern his
province, which also is Saskatchewan.
The acting Leader of the Opposition also
remarked that he had never visited two of our
provinces, namely, Newfoundland and Prince
Edward Island. As he has not been to Prince
Edward Island, I feel sure he would be interested to hear something about it.
All the land is low and the most beautiful it is
possible to see, and full of beautiful trees and
meadows. This is a land of the best temperature.

This is how Jacques Cartier described
Prince Edward Island when he came across it
in June, 1534. During its occupation by the
French it was known as Isle St. Jean, and it
was not until 1798 that it was renamed Prince
Edward Island, in honour of Prince Edward,
Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria.
Soon after the fall of Louisbourg, in 1758, the
British took possession of the island and it
was finally ceded to Great Britain by the
Treaty of Paris in 1763, at which time it was
placed under the government of Nova Scotia.
In 1769 the island was given a separate government, and in 1773 the first General
Assembly met at Charlottetown.
Although Prince Edward Island did not
join confederation until July 1, 1873, it has
often been called the "cradle of confederation", for it was at Charlottetown, on September 1, 1864, that a conference was held
to consider a possible union of the Maritime
provinces, and the visit of a delegation from
Canada widened this into the general conference which brought into existence the
Dominion of Canada.
Prince Edward Island is approximately
145 miles in length from east to west, and
from 4 to 35 miles in width, covering an
area of 2,184 square miles, or nearly 1,400,000
acres. The island was originally larger than
it is now, but the action of the sea has
worn away the shores on all sides, particularly on the north. The sand dunes that
have formed on this shore now bar the sea
from the land, and beyond these barriers
are miles of magnificent beaches, affording
the finest of surf bathing. Although the island

is small in area it has a shore Une extending
1,020 miles, and no part of the island is far
from tide water.
Few places, if any, on the American continent, possess the pastoral scenery and
natural beauty spots to be found on Prince
Edward Island. Its beautiful groves, gently
undulating hills covered with the greenest
of verdure, and freely flowing streams are
all pleasing to the eye. The long, smooth
beaches and red cliffs rising out of the blue
sea add an appealing touch to the scenery.
There is neither a mountain nor a very
high hill on the whole island, and rock
exposures are seldom seen except along its
shores. One of the outstanding characteristics of Prince Edward Island is its ideal
summer climate with its clear skies, sunny
days and cool nights. Owing to the influence
of the surrounding sea, the province is singularly free from extremes of heat and cold.
Prince Edward Island is the most densely
settled province of Canada, with a population
of about 95,000 to 100,000 people, 75 per cent
of whom live in the rural areas. Persons
over seventy years of age make up more
than 6 per cent of the population, a percentage much higher than that of the same
age group in any other province. The longevity of its people is attributed in part to
the vivifying air and healthy life of the
island.
The chief industry of the province is agriculture, and this accounts for the high percentage of its rural population. No minerals
of economic importance are mined in Prince
Edward Island, but there are occurrences of
sand, gravel, building stone and peat. The
shale formation of certain districts has
attracted the attention of petroleum prospectors, and boring concessions have been
granted by the government to promoting
companies. About twenty-five years ago,
some actual boring operations did take place
to the depth of about one mile, but without
success; and a comparatively short time ago
further boring was undertaken, with the
same lack of success.
Manufacturing industries are few, and of
these many are only seasonal, being mainly
allied with the farming and fishing industries.
However, creameries and cheese factories are
scattered throughout the island, and they cover
the province with their milk routes. There
are large creameries at Charlottetown and
Summerside; and central creameries, where
cream is gathered by rail and truck, are
located at a number of other points. The
manufacture of potato starch is carried on
in several localities, and fruit, vegetables and

NOVEMBER 25, 1953
meat are produced in various quantities.
Many lobster canneries dot the shore line
and give employment to several thousand
people during the open lobster-fishing season.
There is a large meat-packing plant, and
tobacco factories, machine shops, and so
on.
Flour and lumber mills are to be
found throughout the island. Our manufacturers, though comparatively few, have
established a fine reputation in other countries
as well as in Canada.
The fishing industry is very important, but
takes a secondary place to agriculture. Prince
Edward Island, situated as it is in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, where may be found large
quantities of practically all varities of fish
that inhabit the waters of the Atlantic coast
of Canada, is in a position to take a leading
place among fish-producing countries. However, circumstances have prevented its
fishermen from taking full advantage o
their opportunities, and fishing still remains
a secondary industry in the province. But
the island is noted for the fine flavour of its
fish products, and it is able to profitably
export lobsters, oysters, cod and smelts. Fishing for trout, clams and salmon is greatly
enjoyed by the residents and is now a major
attraction for tourists.
Agriculture, principally mixed farming, is
the chief industry and source of wealth. About
70 per cent of the population is engaged in
it, and the province is widely known for
the variety and excellence of its products.
Dairy products, beef, wool, lamb, bacon hogs,
poultry products, foxes, seed potatoes, seed
grain, and fruits are among the island's major
sources of income.
More than 87 per cent of the area is under
occupied farms; and farming affords a direct
livelihood for three-fourths of the population
and an indirect one for a large percentage
of the remainder. The various names by
which Prince Edward Island is known abroad
attest to the place given to agriculture and
the high value placed upon the island's products: "The Million-Acre Farm," owing to the
large proportion of arable land; "The Garden
of the Gulf," from its great productivity;
"The Denmark of Canada," from the prominence given to dairying and "The Home of
the Fox Industry," from the fact that the name
of Prince Edward Island is indelibly associated with the pioneers' efforts to domesticate
the fox.
A combination of assets make Prince
Edward Island an ideal summer holiday land
for tourists. It is easily reached by train,
while good motor roads through interesting
and diversified country also lead to the province. No part of the island is more than a
few miles from the sea or its inlets, and sea
bathing and boating may be indulged in

nearly all round the coast. The angler will
find good trout and other fishing in many
streams amidst surroundings of the most
pleasant nature. The pastoral scenery has a
singular loveliness and charm. Miles of paved
roads make motoring a pleasure. The accessibility of golf-courses, beaches, summer
hotels, a splendid national park, the presence
of historic sites of national interest, the quiet
havens of rest and a delightful climate, all
tend to appeal to the tourist's fancy. Fresh
seasonable foods of wide variety, for which
the island is famous, are always available,
and tourists will find all their requirements
met.
To substantiate what I have already said,
may I read from an article which appeared
in the Guardian, on September 21, 1953,
under the caption, "Had Warm Praise for
Island Province":
A noted American visitor during the month of
August was Mr. Kim Sigler of the State of
outstanding trial
and
Michigan, Ex-Governor
lawyer.

Writing of his impressions of the Island,
Mr. Sigler said:
It has been my good fortune over the past few
years to have flown my own plane into almost
every nook and corner of the western hemisphere
from the tip of South America to the Arctic Circle.
In all those miles I have never found a more peaceful and enjoyable spot than Prince Edward Island.
Coming across from the mainland we were flying
about six thousand feet, the sky was clear, the
visibility was unlimited and there lying before us
was that beautiful expanse of well-improved farm
lands as far as the eye could see. As one looks
at Prince Edward Island from the air, it looks like
a veritable garden spot, so green and rich with
its fields laid out in an interesting checker-board.
When I was within radio distance of the airport
I called on my two-wave radio and was immediately impressed with the friendliness of the operator whom I had never met or seen. From then on
during our entire stay that same spirit of friendliness prevailed.

Mr. Sigler expressed surprise at the
island's large exports of potatoes, fish and
cheese. As he put it, "With your transportation difficulties you have done a mighty fine
job". He went on to say that in a recent
public address he had had the pleasure of
telling a large audience of the delightful gem
that lay so nicely situated in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence.
In closing, I wish to extend a cordial invitation to the acting Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and his good wife to visit
the province of Prince Edward Island whenever it may be convenient for them to do so.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

TOURIST TRAFFIC
COMMITTEE EMPOWERED TO MAKE INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
with leave, I move:
That the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic
be empowered to inquire into and report upon the
activities of the various agencies concerned with
promoting tourist travel in Canada, and that the
committee be authorized to send for persons and
records.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: The answer to the question is as follows:
By section 139(3) (c) of the Income Tax Act a
person employed or engaged by the federal government and serving outside Canada retains his status
as a resident of Canada for income tax purposes
and is liable for Canadian income tax if he was
resident in Canada immediately prior to his
appointment or employment by Canada or if he
received representation allowances in respect of
the year.
It is possible that there are some Canadians
employed or engaged by the federal government
and serving outside Canada who are not subject to
Canadian income tax for the reason that they were
neither resident in Canada immediately prior to
their employment nor in receipt of representation
allowances, but the Taxation Division has no
information as to the number of persons in such
category.

NOVEMBER 29, 1953
I want also to congratulate the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) upon
the masterly speech she delivered when
moving the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. She showed by her eloquent
and stirring speech that she has long been
concerned with social, patriotic and political
questions in every field, and that she has
dedicated herself to help in solving parochial,
municipal, provincial or national issues. We
are all convinced that the Senate has made
a very valuable acquisition in the person of
the honourable senator from Sorel.
I also wish to congratulate the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) upon her splendid speech and
her revealing words about the wealth and
beauty of her province. I think this is the
best place to make one's views better known
not only to those present here but to the
whole country, and to show to all Canadians
that we are proud to have the great honour
and pleasure of representing our province
here.
Since the beginning of the present session, the honourable senator from Prince
Edward Island (Hon. Mr. McIntyre) has also
lauded the beauties of his province. We have
nothing to fear and it is our duty to carry
on in this way. Those are things we all
ought to know, honourable senators, for our
country is so large and its attractions are so
numerous and interesting that however long
we lived we could not know them perfectly.
It is a particularly good way to show in all
its greatness the wealth of our provinces.
I would particularly like to assure the
honourable senator from Fredericton that by
ber distinction and great oratory she has
shown that she, too, is a great asset to
the Senate. Her speech revealed ber deep
legal knowledge.
May I, honourable senators, recall the
memory of my predecessor in this place, the
distinguished and lamented Dr. Lacasse,
from Tecumseh. You have seen him stand
up here, you have heard his rousing, patriotic
and above all his very Canadian speeches,
for if it is true that he was a great defender
of our rights in this country. He defended
on all occasions the rights, the freedom and
the faith of our fellow-citizens regardless of
creed, race or other considerations. His
untimely death has been a loss felt not only
by Ontario but by the whole country. As
you know, be would rise each time a right
was threatened; and every time he thought
that we had some grievances he would insist
that they be looked into with due respect
until justice was done.

In the Windsor area, he was esteemed and
admired by everyone; all his fellow-citizens
in that section of the country attended his
imposing funeral. I know be will now rest
in peace.
He was a great patriot and
a great Canadian, in the full meaning of the
word, and thanks to his deeds and to his
speeches, our natural, constitutional and cultural aspirations are now better understood.
(Text:)
Honourable senators, I just want to say a
few words about my appointment to the
Senate. I have already personally thanked
the leader of my party, the Prime Minister,
for my nomination, and now I want to express my thanks publicly. I greatly appreciate the nomination because I had decided
that I did not want to be a candidate in another election. I knew that decision would
cause a terrific vacuum in my life, for of
course one cannot spend eight years in municipal politics and twenty-seven years as
a member of parliament without feeling the
urgency of remaining in public life. The
only way I can try to reward the leader of
my party is to serve to the utmost of my
ability as a member of the upper house. The
years that I spent in the other place were
happy ones for me, for I had friends among
all parties there: I never heard a word of
recrimination against myself, and I made
lasting friendships. Honourable senators, it
was a great privilege for twenty-three years,
before the redistribution of my constituency,
to represent a majority of which the largest
number were English-speaking and Protestant. I will always greatly cherish in my
memory the fact that in no instance, on no
occasion, did I ever hear a single word spoken
against my faith and my race. This is true
Canadianism. I received magnificent support
from every section of our population. It is
a wonderful accomplishment in itself to be
able to serve the people, and it carries its
own reward. Pecuniarily speaking, and using
an ordinary everyday term, to be a member
of parliament or to be a senator is absolutely
a washout; but one receives full compensation in serving one's people, in being of some
assistance to them. That is what counts.
I repeat that the twenty-seven years I was
a member in the other place were happy and
full years. During that period of time we
passed through two very severe and deep
crises. The first of these was the depression,
and God forbid that there will ever be another, although we should not be afraid to
meet a regression, to talk about it thoroughly,
for we do not want to be blind again as we

SENATE
were in the thirties. We must be prepared
for any emergency, and to foresee and face
eventualities, hoping all the while that those
conditions will never again occur in this
country or in the United States, or indeed
anywhere in the world.
During those days I used to receive as
many as two hundred visitors a day, and
sometimes at the end of the day I was all in.
My dear mother used to say to me, "Joe,
how can you stand it?" And I said, "Mother,
the only way I can stand it is by knowing
that I do a great service in telling people
that we will have better days again, telling
them of ways and means whereby it it possible to bear the burdens of fathers and
mothers and everybody else."
The second crisis was World War II. After
World War I we thought that civilization
would never again permit the sacrifices and
horrible holocausts that occurred during that
long struggle. However, in less than a quarter of a century the hordes of barbarism
again tried to destroy Christendom and civilization. But again the call was answered.
Although we Canadians were thousands of
miles away from the centre of conflict, we
knew we were in jeopardy because the isms
that were rampant could easily fly over the
ocean, and so there was no immunity from
their attacks, mental, spiritual, or physical.
Canada did her duty. It was not an easy
matter to be a member of parliament at that
time. Honourable senators, many times have
mothers of two or three or more sons who
had enlisted told me they wanted to keep
one of them at home. And mothers of only
one would say: "Mr. Bradette, can you not
save my boy from having to go? He is the
only one that we have and he may be taken
away from us." Nevertheless they said they
wanted to do all they could. Circumstances
like that made you realize that it was no
sinecure to be in public life. And I know
that you, honourable senators, had similar
experiences. I am aware of that because
many of you were colleagues of mine in the
other place. And may I remark at this point
that I feel perfectly at home here. However,
Mr. Speaker, if I should transgress against
any rule of the Senate I hope you will show
me indulgence, for of course there is always
a degree of uncertainty when a person finds
himself in a new position.
Before I proceed further I want to say a
few words about the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig). He is a
prince of a man with a regal bearing, and
is highly esteemed by all. I am in close contact with the West and many of our people
know the honourable gentleman, for whom

they have only words of praise. The wish of
us all is that be will fully recover his health
soon so that we shall not long be deprived
of his presence among us in this forum.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bradelte: I also want to pay my
tribute to the acting Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I enjoyed his speech
the other day, as I am sure we all did. Most
members of the other house make it a point
to read the speeches that are delivered in
this forum, and they generally are good
speeches indeed. I want to compliment the
acting Leader of the Opposition upon his
practical and laudable speech. A little tinge
of partisanship found its way in here and
there, but that is all to the good. Constructive
criticism is what makes life interesting.
There is one matter in particular that I
want to compliment the acting Leader of the
Opposition on. In the West there is a wheat
problem at the present time, and the honourable gentleman dealt with it in a Canadian
way. There was no blue-ruin talk about it.
There was no despair in his voice nor in his
words, for he knows that the obstacles which
we have to face will be surmounted in such
a way that nobody will suffer too grievously.
As I am somewhat of an agriculturist
myself I would like to say that from 1915 to
1925 in my own section of northern Ontario
we had the greatest agricultural development in the whole of Canada. In our part
of the country we have had such calamities
as devastating forest fires, widespread epidemics and extensive destruction by premature frosts, but we never despaired. We
would never say anything that would harm
that section of Canada.
But when the West suffers, the East is
bound to suffer along with it. We in central
Canada do not belong to a strictly geographical section as do the people of the
East or the West. We know the mayors of
such cities as Winnipeg and Vancouver as
well as we know the mayors of cities in
eastern and central Canada. So we are most
impartial in our viewpoints and not sectional.
The situation in the West today is much
less serious than it was in 1950, when the
crop was smaller than it is this year; in fact,
in 1950 they had practically no crop. Why
should we despair because the West has a
surplus of wheat? That is a good thing for
Canada and for the world at large. However,
the government may have to assist western
farmers in some way in the marketing and
storing of their surplus grain. But whatever
happens, the farmers do not want the pity
and distorted statements which they are
getting from some groups in the other place.
The farmer is an individualist and a practical

NOVEMBER 26, 1953
person, and he will make his own way if he
can. Honourable senators will remember that
in 1950 the government guaranteed bank loans
to farmers to the extent of several million
dollars-I have forgotten the exact amountbut all that the farmers took up under the
plan was no more than about $600,000.
I do not suggest, honourable senators, that
there is nothing to be done today to help
the farmer over the hump in marketing or
storing his products, and I am certain that the
government will do the practical thing.
Before I leave the subject of the farmer
I should like to compliment the honourable
acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) upon his good spirit and constructive attitude towards the problems of his
province. It has been my privilege over the
past six or seven years to visit nearly every
part of the world; and my travels have
demonstrated to me that no matter how large
and powerful a country may be it has its
own problems to meet. Surely it is within
the will and the ability of the people of
Canada to surmount the problems faced by
the western farmer today, and also any other
situations that confront us.
I should like now to turn to a subject which
might not be regarded as political, but which
I believe can best be drawn to the attention
of the people of Canada by discussing it in
this chamber. I shall say what I have to say
in a kindly way and without bitterness of
any kind, as I highly respect the person
involved.
I wish to refer to an article which appeared
in the November 15 issue of Maclean's magazine, in the column entitled "London Letter".
The author of that column is Beverley Baxter,
a prominent and important member of the
British House of Commons, and a very good
and interesting writer. I believe he really
wants to be fair in what he says, but the
article which I have before me contains two
or three statements about the province of
Quebec which I feel compelled to rectify.
I am quite sure that had Beverley Baxter
gone to the proper source for his material
he would not have written what he did.
The portion of the article having to do with
the province of Quebec, and to which I would
draw the attention of the house, is as follows:

and ability of Mr. Baxter says that the province of Quebec bas caused the rest of Canada
headaches, he is not, in my opinion, being fair
to himself, and certainly not to that province.
After all, we are one big union-yes, one big
family-and Mr. Baxter should remember
this, for he belongs to one of the finest sections of it. The great glory of the British
Empire is that, no matter how it was created
-though at times force, even brutal force,
was used-the British have always tried to
comprehend the mentality of minorities, no
matter where they were; and this fact applies
forcibly to French Canada. The situation of
a minority group is not a very pleasant one,
even under the best of conditions. Here in
Canada, however, Canadians of French
descent are proud of our country, because
ninety-nine and nine-tenths per cent of the
English-speaking section are co-operative and
friendly with us; and I know that the vast
majority of English-speaking Canadians who
visit the province of Quebec come away
enamoured of her ways of life and of her fine
people. I do not reside in that province at
the present time, although I was born there;
and I am proud to be a Canadian of French
descent.
I quote further:
A friend at the Quebec Garrison Club said-

I know something of the officers of the
Garrison Club, and I am acquainted with the
English-speaking population of the fine city
of Quebec. I am therefore in a position to
say with assurance that nowhere are the two
racial groups more friendly to each other
than in that city. Many of the Englishspeaking inhabitants know French, and the
majority of French-speaking inhabitants also
speak English. You have there the spectacle
of a fine population whose constituents mix,
work and enjoy themselves together in a
spirit of understanding and co-operation.
Mr. Baxter says it was "a friend"-he
mentions no name--who told him that"The French supply the babies and the prime
ministers, the rest of Canada pays the taxes."

That statement is not fair, even to Mr.
Baxter. Then he continues:

and I do not believe that it will ever fully
recover from the effects.
I hope the efforts to settie the strices in the
Porcupine will corne to fruition in the very
near future. As we ail know, the gold-mining industry is at the present time a depressed industry. I have long thought that
gold, which is a metal needed both internationally and nationally, should f ollow the
trend of ail metals and not be maintained
at the price at which it was fixed prior to
to and during the war. Before the war
we had 140 gold mines operating, but only
60 are operating now. Despite this fact, there
is stifl a steady demand for our gold because
of the international monetary system and
for multiple other reasons. I was delegated
on two occasions to attend conferences at
Washington on the gold question. I knew
there was littie use in going, for the authorities at Washington argued that an increased
price of gold would resuit in inflation. This
may be true ta some extent, but I doubt it.
The price of lead, copper and zinc bas increased tremendously, in same cases by as
much as 100 per cent and more, and this has
resulted in some degree of inflation. However, I would point out that our whole economic structure bas f ollowed that trend for
some years naw.
I have no time ta speak about this today,
except to say that if this trend continues it
may resuit in the ruination of democracy
as we know it. The present price of gold
is fixed at $35 an ounce, which was the
price for years prior ta the last war. Honourable senators, there is no placer gold mining
in the northern parts of Ontario, Quebec and
Manitoba. Our gold is being mined from
solid rock, which is a very expensive pracess.
Had it not been possible ta extensively
mechanize aur gold mining, I doubt whether
there would be more than ten Canadian gold
mines in operation taday. Our gold mines,
ta a cansiderable degree, have had ta replace
manual labour with machinery, but everybody is suiffering from a standardized price.
A few days ago in the Daily Press of
Timmins I saw a picture of young miners
cutting fue]-wood for their familles. There
was nothing wrang with that, but it resulted
in the farmers af the area being deprived of
their seasonal employment. At the present
time there is practically na demand for bushmen or axemen for bush aperation in that
district, because the miners are idie. Labour
unions and management must get together,

Kapuskasîng when the strike vote was being
taken there, and as I once belonged ta a
trade union I know what a strike vote means.
I do not say this in any spirit of criticism,
but I remember that when I was working
in the Quebec forests a labour leader advised
us workers on one occasion that we were
going to get from $10 ta $15 more a month.
Well, I was not going to vote against a strike
which. would mean an increase in pay.
Things are different now, however, for there
is s0 much involved affecting every section
of our population that a great deal of consideration shauld be given before a strike
vote is allowed ta be taken. In most cases
the resuit of the vote is a foregone conclusion. Many of these strikes are not instigated by Canadian labour leaders, but by
people coming from another country. It
would have been calamitous for aur newsprint and sulphate industries if a strike had
taken place, but management and labour
were able ta get together and settle their
problem without a strike, although a strike
vote had been taken. Bath management and
labour are ta be praised for their action in
this matter.
The foliowing Monday I went ta the railway station in Kapuskasing to send a wire
ta Hearst. While I was there I met a brother
of mine who is a conductor on C.N.R. freight
trains. He was with several other trainen
and they told me they had just received
orders ta move several box cars frorn the
mill. They said these cars were ta be moved
ta the railway yards because the paper company could flot pay the freight charges if the
mill became idle. Had this strike taken place
the railway employees would have lost some
work on the road, and woodcutting and
lumbering operatians would have been
greatly curtailed, resulting in thousands of
bush workers being without fruitful employment this winter.
When such things happen many people,
including mothers and their families, suifer

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do you blame that on
the union?
Hon. Mr. Bradette: No, I did not say the
union alone was to blame, but that management and the union were to blame. I said
the strike was started by the union, not by
the management. I maintain that labour and
management must become more and more cooperative in Canada. Our people expeet that
situation to be attained. Labour is of age today, it is powerful, well organized, and has
funds at its disposal. It might be said that
in the early part of this century-say from
1900 to 1920-labour was not able to take
care of itself and had to fight for its survival.
But that cannot be said today. Labour must
of necessity accept its responsibilities, and it
has been accepting them. Honourable senators must realize that the railway strike of
some three years ago, for instance, was responsible for the loss by our two railway
systems of considerable passenger and freight
traffic to highway trucking.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: You cannot get away
from that. At a trucking -convention held
two weeks ago here at Ottawa it was said
that if the railway strike had lasted much
longer the trucking business would have
taken two-thirds of the freight traffi.c away
from the railroads. I believe in the fundamental principle of striking, but it is a
weapon which should be used only when
absolutely necessary, and when all other
means have been exhausted, otherwise it
carries with it elements of destruction and
disunion, suffering and disintegration, no
matter where the responsibility lies.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think you might
attribute that to management as well as to
labour.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: I have said that. I
say this very sincerely, that if the mutual
responsibility had been assumed the strike
might have been prevented. In our section
years ago industry was not as big as now,
and compared with today there were practically no mining operations. Nowadays the
ramifications of industry are such that when
a strike occurs the whole country is involved
and no one is immune from its effects. For
instance, when the dairy strike was on in
your city of Toronto, honourable senators, millions of quarts of milk were thrown in the
gutters. Children and their mothers and other
citizens were deprived of their normal con-sumption of milk. I am not blaming anybody,
but am simply stating facts. Somebody is
bound to suffer immediately from the effect
of a strike: you cannot get away from that.
I say that before any strike occurs management should do everything possible to meet
the situation half way, because management

is often at fault; it is not always the labour
unions that are at fault, but labour also has
some great responsibilities to shoulder.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was on a conciliation
board in connection with the railway strike to
which the honourable senator has referred,
and I should like him to assure me that by
what he has said he was blaming neither the
one side nor the other.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Because I know something about it.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: I left neither management nor labour out; I put them together.
I know there are times when management has
sinned grievously, too. I hope differences
between management and labour are fast
disappearing.
I think I have said all I want to say
at the present time about strikes, except to
repeat that the strike leaders as well as
management, are realizing more and more
their responsibility. To illustrate my point, I
have in my hands some newspaper clippings
from the Ottawa Journal. One column, in
the issue of October 15 of this year, bears the
following headline, "Mosher sees unions finding it tougher to get wage boosts." When
management finds reasons for settling
grievances, that is all to the good, too. The
article to which I refer contains these words:
A. R. Mosher, Montreal, President of the Canadian Congress of Labour, Wednesday predicted that
Canadian unionists will find it harder to negotiate
wage increases this year.

Mr. Mosher is a good Canadian; he has
been engaged in the work of labour unionism
since he was a young man, and he knows
that uncontrollable inflation will occur if,
for instance, railway men were to receive
a general wage increase at the present time.
He realizes that a wage increase would
result in increased freight rates and passenger fares. As a man of judgment and wide
experience, Mr. Mosher knew that if he
expressed himself in favour of another wage
increase this year it would be unwise. He
deserves to be complimented by the whole
nation upon his discretion and foresight. Mr.
Mosher knows that we cannot afford to
arouse the passions of our people, merely
because labour is big and powerful. His high
position carries too much responsibility for
that and he accepts the heavy obligations
which labour must assume in the interests
of our national economy and the part that it
must play in our national life.
The newspaper article continues:
He said the C.C.L. intends to step up its organizing activities, particularly among the whitecollared groups and the distributing trades; expand
its educational program and increase its political
action in favour of the C.C.F.

SENATE
That must have been an afterthought. If
I know anything, whenever management and
labour can get along together, labour will
endeavour to get along very nicely without
the intervention of the federal and provincial
governments. The moment we have the
socialist state in this country-which God
forbid-we end private enterprise and the
ability to open up our north country, for
example, by rugged individualism as in the
past. The first thing a socialist government
would do, were it in power, would be to
shackle management and labour. You cannot
get away from that. That was what the
Labour government in Britain did when it was
in office. But I must say this, that as a leader
of labour Mr. Mosher is highly respected and
alert, and he knows that a man who belongs
to a union, pays his fees and is in good
standing, is entitled to union rights, as a
good Canadian is also entitled to vote for
whom he likes.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Brade±te: In my section of the
country I have often had a man say to me,
"Joe, I belong to a union but I am still an
independent man, free in all my actions,
including my right to vote as I see fit, and
when I vote at the next election I will vote
for the candidate of my own choice". If Mr.
Mosher is going to try to throw the whole
weight of his union behind one party, he
will defeat his own end.
I was proud of the fact that at the last
presidential election in the United States,
when the labour leaders said they were
putting all their weight behind the Democratic candidate for the presidency, and
raised large funds for the support of that
party, labour did not hesitate to vote as
it liked. The unions did not follow the dictates of their leaders. After all, the working
man, a member of a union, is just as free
as anybody else. He is just as free as the
Queen of England, as free as any other
citizen of the world. It is not democratic for
labour leaders to tell members of their trade
unions how to vote, and nany unions resent
that kind of undue influence. It is not real
freedom. As a former member of a trade
union I, for one, would not like any leader
of a trade union to tell me that I must vote
Liberal or Conservative. If any union leader
did that I would tell him immediately where
to go, and that how I intended to vote was
my own business.
It does not make sense that a member of
the C.C.F. party should go to the farmers of
the West or of the East and say, "You must
vote Socialist", and then tell the labour
unions that they must vote Socialist also.

Such commands do not jibe. The farmers
cannot accept the principle of the forty-hour
week. I know that in the section of the
country which I come from the forty-hour
week for farmers is not benefiting thern, and
that unless they can get along without hiring
help it is almost impossible to remain on
the farm. The day is fast approaching when
the forty-hour week will create a serlous
crisis in agriculture in Canada. I am afraid
that you cannot get away from that.
I would like to refer to another union
decision which was made this fall, in the
month of September, whereby the railwaymen, 150 thousand of them, decided not to
go on strike. Mr. Hall is an able man, and
Mr. Mosher is an able man, as is Mr. Bengough; and all the Catholic Union leaders
are able men; but, being human, they may
err and be carried away. However, this time
good judgment was used, because they knew
that if an increase of wages was wrung from
the railways it would only cost so much more
to move food and coal and other necessities
to different parts of the country and that
the cost of railway passenger service also
would increase.
Honourable senators, economically speaking we are living at the present time in a
dangerous period. The cause of the danger
can be stated in one word, and that word
is 'inflation'. We are going to do all we
possibly can to check inflation, for I am
sincerely convinced that if the cost of living
increases another 25 or 30 per cent it will
mean the bankruptcy of our national economy
and the bankruptcy of every one of us. Oldage pensions will have to be increased, other
payments will have to be increased, and a
vicious circle will be created, and eventually
the source of revenue for our governments
will be dried up.
I would like to point out that there are
two ways to bring about a depression. I am
going to use that word, and I am really not
ashamed to do so, for if we fail to do anything to prevent a depression because of
being ashamed to talk about it, then a depression may come about. On that matter we
must be more realistic than we were in the
thirties. There are two ways to bring about
inflation quickly: one is by unfairly lowering
wages; the other is by greatly increasing
them. It is the duty of every Canadian, even
if it involves certain personal sacrifices, to
see that inflation is checked. Let us try, as
strongly as we can, to do that. Let us not
run away from it, because if we do not fight
it the bitter result will be as horrible as conditions that follow in the train of inflation.
Honourable senators, I reiterate that inflation must be checkmated.

Honourable senators, before concluding my
remarks I should like merely to mention
Spain; I shall not discuss it at length today,
but I intend to speak about it during the
present session. I am proud of the fact that
there is now an agreement between that
country and the United States. I put this
proposition to you: the insurrection in Spain

Europe. I do not intend to enlarge on that
statement, except to ask why some European
nations will not today deal with Spain when
they deal with Yugoslavia and would also
trade with Russia if Malenkov were willing
to bargain with them. Why should we resent
the government that Spain bas chosen for
itself? What would have been the alternative
result had Franco and his army been crushed?
I leave that question to you to answer. There
can be no doubt that communism would have
overrun the peninsula, and eventually the
whole of Europe.
Let us be practical and logical; yes, let
us be sensible. There are people who severely
criticize Franco because he is asking for the
return of Gibraltar. Suppose for a moment
that there was a kind of Gibraltar located
off southern England, for instance, belonging to Spain or some other nation: the natural
thing for Britain to do would be to protect
herself in every way she could, and she would
certainly ask for the return of that strategic
land to ber sovereignty.
I just want to leave with you, honourable
senators, one or two thoughts on matters of
world affairs. During the last two world wars
we gave of the best we had, according to
our resources, and our effort was a valiant and
a sizable one. We were not seeking territorial
or maritime aggrandizement of any kind: All
we wanted was to see peace, freedom and
democracy predominate in the world. And
since the last war we have supported the

Atlantic Pact and other international arrangements generously and to the best of our
ability.
I believe Canada bas a right to say as I
can say to my old mother country this afternoon: "France, we realize you have suffered
much, yet it should be possible for you to
be friendly with your neighbours; particularly, you should be friendly with Spain."
True, France has much cause to fear Germany, because three generations of French
people have suffered at the hands of three
successive German invasions. In the year
1870 Germany exacted great tribute in money
and other assets from France. In the period
1914-19 France lost almost a whole generation;
indeed, it cannot be denied that she made the
greatest of all sacrifices in that conflict. In
the Second world war she suffered a terrific
loss of manpower and immeasurable destruction of property, and she is still smarting to
some extent as a result of that awful experience. Perhaps France bas cause for concern about her relations with the German
people.
I am not a prophet, but I believe, and I
state this very sincerely, that Germany has
drunk deeply enough from the bitter cup of
war, murder and destruction. That country has
now placed at the head of West Germany
Conrad Adenauer, one of the great statesmen
of the present day. The people of West
Germany do not believe in communism; they
want a united country and so do the people of
East Germany. In a united Germany the
energies of the European nations will meet and
maintain the integrity and national life of a
great race of people, and there is no doubt
that united Germany will play a great role
of stability and strength.
A very fine thing happened in East
Germany on the 16th or 17th of June l'ast,
two days that shook the world, when people
not wearing the military uniform or the
black cross or any other designation and
being unarmed-being in fact mill and
factory workers-faced tanks and guns to
protest the yoke of communism which they
had been made to carry. Some observers
of that spectacle said that many fine German
youths were crushed by Russian tanks, and
that guns were used against the unarmed
populace. Nevertheless, the German people
demonstrated their spirit of freedom and
their desire to be a self-respecting nation
again.
Let me say that it is my belief that regardless of who may occupy East Germany,
to the German patriots Prussia will always
be an integral part of that country. It is

NOVEMBER 26, 1953
historically inescapable: and an irredential
spirit will persist in their minds until the
country is united.
I was in France only last year, and I
know that the French people are not unfriendly towards the Germans. They know
that in Chancellor Adenauer they have a
real friend. The demonstrations in East
Germany last June should give encouragement to other European countries who must
now know what the proud nation of Germany
thinks of communism.
We hope that by
the advancement of the work of the European
Defence Committee and the strengthening of
the Atlantic Pact, we shall one day be
able to raise the Iron Curtain for the benefit
of the German people. I hope that within
the not too distant future they will regain
their freedom and be able to live their
own lives of peace and prosperity within
the democratic family of the world. And
what a deterrent it will be to the leaders
in the Kremlin when they see the sons of
France and Germany standing shoulder to
shoulder with the other members of the
European Defence Committee, upholding the
great ideals of freedom and democracy.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
wish to congratulate His Honour the Speaker
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon his advancement
to the important post he now occupies. I am
sure he need not worry about having any
trouble with me in the future. I am sorry
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is not present. I was very pleased
at the manner in which he has carried on
his duties thus far, although I must not be
supposed to agree with everything he said.
I wish also to congratulate the hon.
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) and
the honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) on their speeches in
respectively moving and seconding the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
It is getting late, and I propose, after
having made a few remarks, to ask the
privilege of moving the adjournment of the
debate and continuing when we meet again.
I also wish to compliment the other
speakers, including the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), from
whom we always get something useful, and
the honourable senator from that garden of
the gulf, Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr.
McIntyre).
I shall have to read the full text of the
address of the honourable senator from
Cochrane, (Hon. Mr. Bradette), for I did not
catch all he said, but a great part of his
83280-51

speech was, I thought, splendid, especially
what he said regarding strikes and what
they have cost this country. In this day and
age, which has seen the development of
atomic energy and other great discoveries,
surely sone better method of composing disputes can be found than strikes, which not
only are wasteful but breed hatred and all
kinds of difficulties. The unfortunate effects
have been very evident in the districts which
the honourable senator represents. Gold
mines provide employment for their workers
and markets for farmers. The owners of the
gold have their properties stored in the
ground, and if impossible conditions and
demands are presented to them they can
afford to leave it there, but when work
ceases the effect is serious for the whole
community-towns, villages and farms.
We have heard a good deal about the
marketing of wheat, and I intend to say a
little more about it. I shall be quite critical
of the government, but that, I suppose will
astonish nobody. Last year there was a strike
at Vancouver: ships were held up for some
six weeks, at a cost to their owners of millions of dollars; and the shipowners were
not the only losers, for we shall never regain
the market for some 30 million bushels of
wheat. Had I been in the position of the
responsible member of the federal government, I would have camped right on the spot.
Let me at this point, while extending congratulations to our newly-summoned members, remind them that by virtue of their
oath of office they are required to advise the
government: they are called here for that
purpose. I have not forgotten this function
of ours, so if I extend any advice I am on
sound legal ground in doing so. Where, I
ask, was the Minister of Labour? He was
attending political meetings throughout Saskatchewan. The strike was going on, ships
were lying idle in the harbour, grain from
all over western Canada had accumulated at
the port, cars were tied up, and farmers
were unable to ship their wheat. But the
Minister of Labour of this government was
attending political meetings. Had I been in
his place, I would have kept on the spot.
My solution of difficulties of this kind is
that strikes should not be allowed. Let labour
present and press its case, let its representatives take all legal means of pressing their
point of view; and when an agreement has
been made, let it be retroactive to the date
that the demands for increased pay were
made. But to hold up the whole economy of
a community, as has been done in the district of the honourable senator from Cochrane and elsewhere, is something which
should never take place in any organized
civilized society.

out the hardships that are encountered in
growing wheat. I am not concerned about
our surplus wheat. for I know we shall eventually find a market for it.
The seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) spoke about the early days at Saint
John, and she referred to wooden ships and
iron men. In paying tribute to the present
government she referred to the social security
measures the government has brought in or
proposes. I should like to say to the honourable senator that, despite this social
security program, I am afraid we now have
steel ships and straw men.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Some people have criticized my province because of its socialism,
but far more socialism is preached at Ottawa
than in Saskatchewan.
Honourable senators, I am alarmed at the
direction in which this Canada of ours is
drifting. For instance, I do not think there
ever was a time when juvenile delinquency
was so prevelant in this country-and this is
in spite of baby bonuses and other social
measures. The amount of juvenile delinquency is nothing short of scandalous, and
it is high time we tried to find out what is
wrong with our educational system and some
other things.
I want to make a few remarks about the
subject of trade. Ever since the last election
the government of Canada has been pleading
with the American people not to impose high
tariffs, but how have the Canadian people
themselves acted? When it seemed possible,
before the last elections in the United States,
that the late Senator Taft might become
President of that country, Canadians who
should have known better were sniping at
that courageous and honest politician. During
the election campaign this year addresses
were broadcast over C.B.C. stations warning
the Canadian people that if the Republican
party were elected to power Canada might
be confronted with higher tariffs. I deplore
that kind of attitude on the part of our
citizens.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Now we go on bended
knee to ask the Americans for trading concessions.
The Republican party is now in power in the
United States; and in any case, it is not for
Canadian public men to criticize the actions
of that party. Recently, much "name-calling" in relation to the United States security
investigation has been indulged in, and some

of our newspapers and public men have gone
so far as to speak of "McCarthyism". Lately
we have had the spectacle of students at the
University of Toronto, Canada's leading institution of learning, going so far as to burn
in effigy this senator, a representative of a
neighbouring state. I think it is nothing short
of scandalous. Our people do not understand the work which that man is conscientiously doing. All this has gone on without
rebuke from any minister of the Canadian
government. Under the circumstances, one
cannot complain if our neighbours are inclined to retaliate. These incidents, and the
Igor Gouzenko affair, have received altogether
too much publicity.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Let me say to the honourable senator who seconded the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) that, although I may be
alone in Canada in holding this opinion, I
conscientiously believe that to have retained
something which we have now discarded
would have had a good effect on our trade
with the mother country and our relations
with the Mother of Parliaments, as well as
all those countries which have been accustomed to carry on their own affairs in a
democratic manner or are trying to work
out along democratic lines a solution of their
difficulties. The honourable senator stated
the women of Canada had been fortunate to
secure from the Privy Council a decision
under the British North America Act that
women are "persons" and therefore eligible
to sit in this chamber. In the light of benefits
of this kind, and of world conditions today,
I believe that it was neither proper nor wise
to abandon our privilege of appeal to the
Privy Council. It must be remembered that
the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a
woman was not a "person", but our women
availed themselves, and with success, of the
right to appeal to the Privy Council. So I
say to the honourable senator from Fredericton: "You are here because tha-t privilege
was secured through the action taken byand all honour to them-a group of noble
Canadian women". I wonder if the honourable lady would be here had that right of
appeal been abolished a few years earlier.
I thought it very unfortunate that, at a
time when so many colonies were drifting
away from the commonwealth we should have
appointed a Canadian Governor General. I
feel keenly about it. Now that Britain can
make a choice as to the countries she trades
with-securing Argentine beef, and butter
and grain in the markets that she considers
most advantageous-I just ask honourable
senators what difference it might have made
if we had retained the custom of appointing

SENATE
a representative of the Queen from the
Mother Country. I think it would have made
a great deal of difference. I know that I
may be criticized for saying so. I mean no
disrespect at all to the very fine gentleman
who received the appointment, but I mention it as a matter of principle. I glory in
the fact that Canada is still a free country.
I wish now to speak on the subject of
dumping by foreign exporters in Canadian
markets. We are going to hear more about
this within the next six months. But what
right has Canada to complain? I have here
an editorial from the Toronto Globe and Mail
of today. It says:
Canada is in no position to complain of "dumping" by foreign exporters into our market while
our own government is selling off its store of
canned pork at fifteen cents a pound.

The complete editorial is quite long.

It is

a fact that Canada is dumping canned pork
in west Germany, and anywhere else she can
sell it. When the agreement to export this
product was announced I said to some of our
women in the west, "Let's try some of this
pork", because I thought it might be ground
snakes, or ground horsemeat. One would
wonder what it was, when we had to sell it
at 15 cents a pound.

remarks at the next sitting of the house.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate

In part, the article read as follows:
J. A. Daoust, vice-president of the International
Brotherhood of Papermakers, said last night in a
statement that "Senator Joseph Bradette should
congratulate rather than criticize union leaders
involved in the recent Ontario paper mill labour
dispute."
Mr. Daoust said that "instead of offering criticism of labour leaders in the sanctuary of the
Senate, Mr. Bradette should offer congratulations
to the labour leaders in avoiding a serious strike
in 21 pulp and paper mills in Ontario".

In reply to these statements, I beg to state
that that is exactly what I did, as recorded
in the Senate Hdnsard of November 26. I
quote from page 61:
It would have been calamitous for our newsprint and sulphate industries if a strike had taken
place, but management and labour were able to
get together and settle their problem without a
strike . . . Both management and labour are to
be praised for their action in this matter.

And on page 62, immediately after a brief
statement by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Senator Roebuck), to
the effect that the strike movement amongst
the pulp and paper mill workers was not
promoted by union leaders from outside the
country, I said:
I am very pleased to hear that, for I have been
told that some of these men came across the line.
I must say that the labour leaders of the trainmen's
organization and the newsprint and sulphate
workers-some of them from the United Stateshave always given good, sound leadership.

In terminating, I can assure Mr. Daoust
that the Senate is not a "sanctuary" for any
of its members. It is an institution of our
parliamentary system where all the senators
are doing their utmost and to the best of
their ability in dealing with legislation and
problems pertaining to the administration of
our country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
I am pleased to see that the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is present
in this chamber today, for I have some
further remarks in connection with the wheat
problem which I am sure he will be pleased
to hear.
The problem in my part of the country,
represented by that great strip of territory
in the northern part of the three Prairie
provinces, lies in the fact that a great deal
of the land was mixed bush and spots of
prairie, and which has cost a very great
sum of money to make tillable. At the
present time, of course, we have modern
methods for cutting bush, which is done by
the use of huge machines. Formerly we
did it by hand or with power supplied by
horses. In eastern Canada the greater part
of bush in bushland is above ground, but
some of the conditions in regard to bushland
in western Canada may be surprising to
eastern farmers.
When we undertake to
clean land in the west we find that a larger
amount of bush is below ground than above
the ground. Willow roots, for instance,
because of the passage of fires years ago,
are still there. These roots will never rot,
and the mounds caused by them are huge.
One can plow poplar roots under with huge
plows, but you must pick and burn willow
roots before you can say the land is clear.
In some of the dry years we would find
wheat growing in depressions. Generally, the
bush grew in these depressions and, of
course, after years and years there were
huge accumulations of leaves. As I said,
in the dry years you would see wheat growing there and even far ahead of wheat growing in other places. For instance, out in
the open prairies you would see little or
nothing. I passed through years in which
we could see wheat growing in these depressions and it was very fortunate that we did
have it, because we needed it to feed it to
our livestock. In order to harvest this wheat
we had to have pieces of iron fastened on
the back of the mower similar to the attachments that eastern farmers use for harvesting peas, and it was necessary to have a man
walk beside the mower and attempt to put
the wheat out in windrows. We went to
all this work in order to harvest about
three bushels of wheat to the acre-not any
more than that. With that we would feed
our chickens and livestock.
Certain parts of western Canada, it is true,
have been receiving plenty of moisture this
fall, but a great part of the West is very dry,
in fact, drier than I have ever seen it. The
bottom of some of the depressions that held
water for three or four years in the past are
now lined with huge cracks, with not

a sign of water in them. It may be too
early to become alarmed, but I can tell honourable senators that unless we secure moisture during this winter or next spring a great
part of that country will go back into
drought land.
Now I come to the question of marketing
of our wheat. What is the hope of marketing
the present crop? I ask. The farmers harvested that wheat and a few fortunate ones
are able to deliver it, but they do not know
what they are going to receive in payment.
The government still is boasting that sales
are being made, but if the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) were
present he might tell us that the system of
selling is based on an exchange in reverse.
They are selling on the basis of future prices.
Can the government give me any idea of
what the price is likely to be? I imagine
they are unable to do so, for as and when
they buy wheat it will be at the going price.
Honourable senators will recall that last
year I was critical of the government because
of its failure to include Britain in its wheat
marketing plan. I pointed out at that time
that evidently we had contributed hundreds
of millions of dollars to maintain the first
wheat agreement under which Britain was
supplied during the war; I believed that bargain was a good one, and I hoped that even
at a maximum price of $2 and a minimum
'of $1.55 Britain would agree to be included
in our current marketing plan. Now I find,
for some reason which I don't know-it may
be the fault of the United States, or the fault
of our own trade minister, orHon. Mr. Wood: Or Britain.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No; Britain was willing
to give $2.
Hon. Mr. Wood: $2.05.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We asked $2.05.
Hon. Mr. Wood: That is correct; we asked
$2.05.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I asked the government
not to let the opportunity to include Britain
pass, for we in western Canada-and I
thought I was speaking for the majority of
the western farmers-would like to see her
brought in even at $2 a bushel. But, no; the
Minister of Trade and Commerce announced
in the other place that the wheat of the world
was held in strong hands, and there would
be no difficulty. What could the western
farmer take that to mean but-and I hope
this is what it means-that he will not suffer
loss because of the government's failure to
secure the British market at $2 a bushel.

DECEMBER 1, 1953

The Honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), speaking of the
present position of western farmers, repeated
the argument we so often hear, that the
farmer is well supplied with money. True,
some farmers are comfortably well off, but,
as I said in my remarks at the previous
sitting, many more are seriously in need of
assistance. I indicated, however, that I would
make no demand on their behalf, but that
a demand would come from the business
people of western Canada who will experience
difficulty in making collections, contracting
for new business and generally carrying on.
The government seems to be more ready to
listen to the appeals of business people than
of farmers; yet, for the most part business
people are in a much better position than
farmers. It has been said that we farmers
have reduced our mortgages over the past
sixteen years. Surely all Canadians, with
increased wages all down the line, are financially better off today than they were sixteen
years ago. Why should not the farmer have
been able at least to reduce his mortgage in
that period of time?
I ask honourable senators to visit western
Canada and see conditions for themselves:
go down the highways and byways and
observe the type of homes in which the
farmers live, without any modern convenience
and unpainted for many years. And judge
for yourselves whether it is as the government says, that they have lots of money.
I am very much afraid-and in this prediction I hope I am wrong-that we are
facing difficult times. If the farmer would
take my advice he would sit tight, and I am
sure he would come out all right. There
seems to be developing in Canada an entirely
wrong idea: that it is a purely industrial
country. The politician of other years always
boasted of agriculture as the basic industry
of Canada; whereas the politician of today
talks for the most part of our great industrial
development. In order to be popular in any
part of Canada he forgets about agriculture
and talks about industry. For my part,
honourable senators, I hold to the belief that
Canada's one great hope is in her agricultural products. Wheat is still a basic industry;
it produces more new wealth for this country
than all our gold and all our oil. It is a
product which the world needs, and its
importance should never be forgotten. Why
is there so much noise about the improved
standing of the farmer with regard to price
and income? Remember, first, that it was
war which created the larger demand. Then
came Marshall aid, by which Canada got
about $1 billion of American money. To hear
some people talk one would think that the
Americans had never done anything for us;
83280--

but we got that money from them. Then
followed the cold war, which also has aided
the prosperity of this country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend
a question?
Is be quite certain that
Canada received Marshall aid-something for
nothing? I don't think Canada received any
Marshall aid.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Canada received about
$1 billion of Marshall aid money, which went
to purchase goods in this country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But we gave something
for it. The nations of Europe had Marshall
aid free.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am saying that we got
some of that money, over a billion dollars
of it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But we gave goods for it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We had no aid money.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Indirectly, of course,
that money was given to aid Europe. But
we got it. I make that statement, and I
am sure it cannot be successfully contradicted.
As regards the farmers' right to dispose of
their wheat, the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has already
explained our position. The other day I
was debarred from selling some wheat to an
honourable senator who wanted to buy it.
The board which controls these things is
not a producers' board; it contains not one
real, true representative of the producers.
Recently I heard some interesting news
about a new method of storing grain devised
by a young man from the Argentine who is
now in this country. The inventor claims
that by his means of storage, partially underground, all air being excluded, he bas been
able to keep wheat nine years without any
deterioration. I understand that he wants
to go into business in Canada, and if some
men with capital would take up the process
and apply it in western Canada they would
perform a great service to the producers
and to the country. There would be a
prospect of ridding the wheat of rust and
other causes of damage which, as matters
are, cannot be avoided if grain is stored too
long and elevators are without spare bins
to which from time to time it 'can be moved.
Destruction of wheat crops by insects has
resulted in heavy losses to American wheat
producers, but I understand that under this
new method wheat would be free from such
damage.
It is customary for honourable members to
take advantage of the debate upon the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: The honourable senator must remember that the price of $1.23
represents the initial payment.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I agree. I maintain that
unless we know how wheat futures are selling
we may overbid ourselves, and we may find
this amount being deducted from a sale at a
later date.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: You do not believe
that, do you?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, it could happen.
Churchill, Manitoba, is the nearest and best
port to northern Saskatchewan. Its weather
has been similar to that in Ottawa this fall,
so even at this late date ships are able to sail
into its ice-free harbour. We in Saskatchewan feel that the port at Churchill could be
put to much greater use. First of all, an
additional grain elevator with a capacity of
5 million bushels should be constructed there.
When I visited Churchill last year the captain
of a ship from the Dalgleish Line told me that
if more wheat were available at Churchill
his company would be ready to send ten ships
in there instead of one. If a new grain elevator were built the railway would be able to
store wheat there during the slack periods,
and the whole scheme would prove of
immense value.
I should like to make a few remarks about
rising freight rates. Labour and freight costs
are increasing, and Canadian farmers, as in
the past, are going to be left unorganized and
unprotected. I have described in this chamber before how the huge interprovincial trucking traffic necessitates the expenditure of enormous sums of money to maintain our highways. All this seems rather needless when
we think of the steel roads and rights of way
of our railway companies. There is no doubt
that trucks cause an enormous number of
accidents on our highways. We are always
seeing pictures of transport trailers that have
been in collision with passenger automobiles
and other vehicles. They certainly do not
help to make our highways safe. I have
already appealed to the government to set up
a committee to study this question, for I think
somebody should be delegated authority to
determine what traffic rightfully belongs to
the trucking companies and what traffic rightPortal, North Dakota, Nov. 3, 1953, $2.10; North fully belongs to the railways.

Throne to speak on many and varied subjects. Consequently, I wish to make a few
remarks about certain matters affecting my
awn province and Canada in general. One
honourable senator has said that Canada's
estimated wheat crop was raised this year
to some 570 million bushels, but I understand the figure to be 614 million. At any
rate, two-thirds of this wheat was grown in
the province which I have the great honour
to represent. There are 16 million acres of
cultivated land in Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Wheat land?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. Many factors determine whether or not a wheat crop will
fail, and there is no question that most
western wheat producers find it a struggle
to produce a profitable wheat yield. For
instance, there has to be sufficient rain -at the
right time, for a few hot spells may ruin a
crop. Last year many crops were comThen there is

summer-fallow, which requires about three
times the normal amount of labour. Many
ummer-fallows must be gone over as often
as ten times, for it is important that weeds
De kept out and that the ground retain its
moisture. The farmer must cultivate his land
and keep it black so that it will conserve
its moisture for the next year's crop. As
there is only one crop, and as it takes much
labour to prepare the land, it is important
that nothing should happen to ruin the crop.
Honourable senators, it cannot be too often
repeated that the prices quoted for western
Canadian wheat, basis Fort William, do not
reflect the picture in so far as western Canada
is concerned. A very small percentage of our
No. 1 Fort William wheat is sold as such. It
is generally agreed that it is sold as No. 2
wheat; and the No. 2 is sold as No. 3, and so
on. This results in lower prices to the farmers. However, I am not actually complaining
about this, for it makes Canadian grain highly
desirable and gives the Wheat Board a good
chance to sell it on the world markets. In
other words, foreign purchasers get first-class
wheat when they buy our so-called class-two
wheat, and they still get a good milling wheat
when they buy No. 4. Here are some comparative prices of wheat today:

DECEMBER 1. 1953
go by a direct road: to go east to Saskatoon
they must first travel seventy miles west to
Battleford and then back to Saskatoon. The
weather last fall was exceptionally warm and
the horses had come in from some distance;
so I put on the bill that the horses must be
watered and fed in Saskatoon. The C.N.R.
have their own yards in Nutana, but for some
reason or other the horses were taken to the
union yards. Usually, I do not go along, but
on this occasion, as I had some business to
do in Saskatoon, I thought I would go over
Sunday morning and see how the horses
arrived and if they had been watered and
cared for. I discovered that one of the two
cars conveying the horses had arrived, but
it took most of the rest of the day to find out
where the other car was. Finally, it was
found that one horse had broken one of its
legs in Battleford. A distance of fourteen
miles could have been saved by putting the
animals off at Denholm, and perhaps the
shunting in the yards at Battleford could
have been avoided. That was not done, and
the animal had to be destroyed. The other
car was supposed to be coming down in the
afternoon coupled to a short freight train.
I kept inquiring if the freight was in, and at
last was told that it was. I saw this small
freight run right by the stockyards and out
on the prairie; and when I went out to see
the horses they were exposed to the heat of
the sun. I asked why they were not left in
the yard, and was informed that the switching crew could not be called in until after
six o'clock, and that the other car was going
on because the two cars could not go together.
I said, "That does not matter, I want those
horses out of the sun; they are fighting out
there". Well, I was told that nothing could
be done until after six o'cl-ock. When the
switching crew did come a man was supposed
to water and feed the horses; but they were
not watered, and if I had not been there the
animals would have died for want of a drink.
So I went to make a complaint, and a fellow
to whom I complained said, "You should truck
them; there is a man who has started to truck
live stock and who will take a whole carload".
He went on to say that the animals would
be unloaded immediately upon arrival and
that there would be no delay such as that
occasioned by the railroads in crew switching.
Honourable senators, you know the position
that the railroads are in, and I submit it is
partly their own fault. The president and
management of the C.N.R. journeyed away
up to Lynn lake to drive a silver spike; they
tried to imitate what Donald A. Smith did at
the ceremony marking the completion of the
83280-6à

transcontinental railroad and they must have
taken along a whole carload of officials. What
nonsense! If instead they had devoted that
time to the live stock shipping problem, they
would have done something sensible and
practical.
The Speech from the Throne contained a
reference to surplus wheat, but made no
suggestion as to. how to dispose of it. It is
said, too, that Canada has a surplus of meat.
Well, I have a plan for its disposal. First of
all, I would instruct someone to confiscate
all slicing machines that shave bacon to thin
wafers. I defy anyone to cook such thin slices
properly. There would not have been any
iron men in the old days referred to by
the seconder of the Address (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) if bacon had been sold in such
thin slices then. And if the slices were
thicker today, and larger portions of meat
in general were served at meals, we would
soon get rid of our surplus meat. For some
reason our own Canadian National Railway
does not serve good beef: it offers all sorts
of trash, but rarely serves good roast beef.
I did get a slice once for $3; it was good
beef, but for the portion served to me the
farmer would at the present time receive
about 15 cents. And since coming to eastern
Canada I have had one really good order
of "roast beef": at least, that is what I
ordered. The waiter brought me plenty of
it on the plate, and I assure you it was very
good-but it was horsemeat.
Sorme Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)
spoke of the marvelous medical discoveries
of modern times, and how the span of life
has been extended, and so on. I wonder if he
took into account the large number of young
people being killed on our highways.
A subject of much interest to me is the
polio which has been very bad in the three
prairie provinces. I have in my hand a newspaper clipping, headed "Polio Plague in
Manitoba World's Worst". Despite
the
wonderful discoveries of medicine, epidemics
of this kind still occur in this day and age.
I am not a medical man, but I am inclined
to believe that the best protection against
epidermics, especially for our children, consists in regular hours, plenty of sleep and
plenty of good food. Some medical men may
argue that hearty eaters are in danger of
shortening their lives; but, honourable senators, I could introduce you to a "young man"
of eighty-six, who can do a hard day's work
now just as he has always done. I recall
that back in the days when hotels served

SENATE

really large helpings of food he would dispose of one good helping and then call the
waiter and say, "Very nice; just bring me
another plate of the same thing".
An Hon. Senator: The sample was good!
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, the sample was
good: so good that he said, "Just bring me
another". This man worked for me for a
while-and what a man he was! In those
days he would kill a good-sized pig himself
-a job which today would take two or three
men. One evening after supper we were
getting ready to kill a pig weighing probably
225 pounds, and this he said to me, "If you
have anything else to do, go ahead, I will
kill the pig myself". That shows the kind
of man he was; and at eighty-six he is still
going strong, doing his own work. So I think
[ am on pretty sound ground when I say
that plenty of good food is needed as a
protection against an epidemic.
Honourable senators, I have spoken of
the loss of our young people on the highways.
Something will have to be done about it.
I would like to draw your attention to an
editorial which appeared in the Montreal
Gazette a short while ago. It points out
that last year the death rate per hundred
million vehicle miles travelled in states with
no fixed speed limit was 8 - 1; in those with
a speed limit of sixty miles an hour it was
7.7. The figures for eight states with a
fifty-five mile per hour limit were lower
igain. The death rate in thirteen eastern
states, which have a fifty mile per hour limit
-r less was only 4.9. The article goes on
to say that if the national rate had been
4.9 instead of 7.3, twelve thousand lives
might have been saved. I would urge that
we bestir ourselves on this question of
allowable speeds for vehicles on our highways.
Let me say again that some action will
have to be taken to deal with the problem of
interprovincial trucking. Railroad freight
rates have risen to such a point that for some
lines of business they are almost prohibitive.
If the railways were allowed to handle all
their legitimate business I do not think such
increased rates would be necessary; and
the railways could get this business if the
truckers were put to some other useful
occupation.
Now may I speak for a few minutes on
the question of immigration. I would like to
live to see the day when thirty million people
inhabit this country. The markets of the
vorld may be drying up, but I say that our
greatest market of all is the one we have
right at home here in Canada. I noticed
just recently that someone was complaining
that a number of German settlers did not

complete their agreed-upon year of service
on farms, but instead went to work in industry. Of course, current wages and the fiveday week are very attractive to them and
have had the effect of enticing a lot of
people away frorn farm work. But the
farms need them, badly. We could place
thousands on the farms in the province of
Saskatchewan, for work not only on the
fields but also in the households. It is impossible to secure help. Personally, I think
that the blame for this is entirely attributable to the type of representatives we have
in overseas countries. What I would like
to know is: are they representatives of Canadian industry or of agriculture? I would
be willing to wager that if I were an immigration agent I could find people whose love
of the land would never allow them to be
enticed away from it.
In the province of Saskatchewan the farms
and the homes have been built up by the
generation that are getting old now. The
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
W. M. Aseltine) mentioned that anyone
undertaking to set himself up in farming in
western Canada must have $20,000 to pay
for equipment alone if he is to operate a
I would say
sizeable farm economically.
that land and equipment for a farm are a
$50,000 proposition, not a cent less. I will
admit that it is difficult just now to get
young men to work on the farm or to take
up farming; yet the fact is that any young
man who loves the land and can give a
good account of himself, no matter where
he comes from, would certainly have no
difficulty in getting very generous terms from
farmers who have now arrived at the retiring
age. Many of these farmers have no sons,
or only sons who have gone into industry or
the professions and left the farm. In any
such case the father is anxious to sell his
property, and a young man desirous of setting
himself up as a farmer would only need to
demonstrate his ability. I often think that
this figure of $50,000 as the cost of a farm
and machineryHon. Mr. Macdonald: That would be for
quite a large acreage?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No. I know of some
quarter-sections that are selling as high as

know of was sold for $80,000, and that was in
an area which I formerly thought was bushland, located up in the White Fox country.
In Melfort and in that drainage area there
are some sections, without buildings, that
sold for $15,000. In my own district some
three-quarter sections have sold for $30,000,
and you cannot buy modern machinery to
farm three-quarters of a section for less

DECEMBER 1, 1953
than $20,000 today. And after you have
bought the land you have to erect buildings.
Running a modern farm is a very complex
business.
The Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen, when a member of the Senate,
had this to say about operating a farm:
that in the old days when grain was cut with
a scythe, every man could go out with his
cradle and earn sufficient for his daily needs,
but that is quite a different proposition
today. Today one has to incur heavy debts
and pay interest on them, as well as high
operating costs. Of course, some men are
better managers than others and will undoubtedly outrun them-but the larger the
income, the larger will be the income tax.
Honourable senators, we cannot continue
to waste land as we are doing today.- You
need only go a short distance from Ottawa
to see that we have not a sufficient number
of people on the land. This condition exists
in all the provinces in Canada, but perhaps
on a larger scale in western Canada than in
any other part. In spite of that we are only
receiving a dribble of immigration into this
country. I do not think that we will be able
to force people to live on two or three acres
of land, on which it is impossible to make
a living, while at the same time we sit on
this immense territory that God has left to
us, and permit so much of it to remain
vacant. There is no reason why ten years
from now we could not have and support
right royally thirty million people in this
Dominion of Canada.
Honourable senators, I thank you for your
attention.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, my first words in this chamber must
be of respect for the office of the Speaker,
and of congratulation to the honourable
gentleman who occupies that office (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). The Speakership of the Senate
is patterned more upon the ýSpeakership of
the Commons than upon the Office of the
Lord Chancellor. Our Speaker has neither
the political nor the administrative duties of
the Lord Chancellor.
Like the Lord
Chancellor he presides over the deliberations
of the house, but problems arising out of
questions of order are settled as they are in
the Lords by taking the sense of the house
itself.
I think it right to say, however, that the
Speaker of the Senate is the embodiment of
the dignities and usages of this honourable
chamber, and he is one of the principal
guardians of our Canadian parliamentary
institutions. These are not merely archaic
forms. They are full of symbolism of a
lively parliamentary history. They are a
guarantee of our basic freedoms and are to
be cherished for all our people.

The dignity with which you conduct our
proceedings, Sir, and the reverence with
which you obviously treat the usages and
customs of this house, are to a newcomerand I would venture to think to all honourable senators-most reassuring. We can feel
that in your hands they are safe. I know
it to be a source of gratification to your
fellow Nova Scotians that another of the
sons of that province is making a further
contribution to our Canadian parliamentary
history.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I would associate
myself also with the congratulations which
have been tendered to the new Leader of
the Government party in this house (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). His career at the Bar of
the province of Ontario, where he is one of
Her Majesty's Counsel, his distinguished
record in the armed forces of this country,
his long service to Canada as a private
member of parliament, and the judicial qualities with which he presided over the deliberations in the other place during the late
parliament, all are an earnest of the
judiciousness which will undoubtedly characterize his work here. I hope it would not
be put down to sectional partisanship were
I to say that there is some considerable
satisfaction experienced by the members of
this house from the province of Ontario in
that the onerous tasks of the leader of this
chamber have been entrusted to one of our
number.
I would like to join other honourable
senators in the hope that the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) will have *a
speedy recovery and will soon be able to
resume his duties here. It is a matter of
common knowledge, both in parliament and
in the country, how valuable are his contributions to the deliberations of this house.
His knowledge of public affairs, his deep
learning in the law and the felicity with
which he is accustomed to express himself,
have been an ornament to the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: To the two ladies who
have moved and seconded the motion on
the Address (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin and Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson), because the vocabulary of compliment has already been exhausted, I would
say simply that the bouquets they have had
cannot match the high order and the charm
of their performance. It is probably unique
in parliamentary history, and most appropriate, that the thanks of the Upper Chamber
in this commonwealth country for the first
Address of Her Majesty's representative since

SENATE
Her Majesty's Coronation, should be tendered
to His Excellency by two lady senators.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: May I acknowledge the
great honour involved in the appointment of
myself to this honourable house as a colleague of so many distinguished Canadians.
At the same time I would like to mention
the responsibility I feel to be inherent in
such an appointment. The meaning of the
burden of that responsibility grows with the
days, and I think it can only be relieved out
of the kindness and forbearance of the many
experienced parliamentarians who are here.
If I may say so, I place particular value upon
my appointment in that I have had it at
the hands of the present Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent. Nothing
that I could say would add to the prestige
he brings to his office, to his personal
popularity in the country, or to the distinction with which he directs the domestic and
foreign business of this progressive young
nation so favoured by Providence.
I hope it might be thought appropriate
'hat on the first occasion on which I address
this chamber, I should say something of
those who preceded me in the particular tradition to which I belong. The late Senator
J. J. Bench was perhaps my immediate predecessor. We were contemporaries, and I
consider myself fortunate to have counted
him as one of my very good friends. He was
a lawyer and occupied a position of eminence
at the Bar of Ontario, where he was one of
Her Majesty's Counsel. His career in the
Senate, although relatively short, was memorable. His speech on the functions and purposes of this honourable chamber constitutes
a permanent and valuable contribution to its
history. He was a zealous warden of the
rights, the usages and dignities of the
Senate and he was an eloquent advocate of
its responsibilities. Time and time again he
expressed his views on these subjects here,
and, I think, with the approval of all honourable members. He constantly sought new
avenues of usefulness for the Senate, and his
own usefulness to this chamber was thereby
increased. While his death came in the summer of his career and in the blossoming of
his powers, his legacy to parliament and to
the country was a better appreciation of the
constitutional position of this chamber and
of its purpose in functioning for the common
weal.
The Senate has counted among its valued
members many men from this city and from
the valley of the Ottawa. Because of a personal association with him, I would refer
in the first place to the Honourable Charles
Murphy. He was a great son of Ottawa, his

native city, and a successful barrister in his
practice of the law here. He was a great
conversationalist and a great correspondent.
He was devoted to the cultural traditions of
the Celtic people, particularly to that branch
from which his ancestors sprung. Senator
Murphy was a student of the history of political institutions, and a student also of the
lives of public men in this country and others.
He had a loyalty to his friends-witness his
devotion to Sir Wilfrid-and he practised that
loyalty with a fierceness that brooked no
challenge. He was strongly critical of his
foes if they departed from his rigid but
high standards. His contributions to this
chamber were notable, particularly his speech
in the session of 1934 on the inquiry made
that year into the work of the Senate.
In the other place Charles Murphy was a
doughty warrior when he entered the lists
on behalf of his party. Satire, invective,
indignation-these were his heavy weapons,
and he laid them on without mercy in cases
where he felt they were appropriate; but
when he came here in his sixty-fourth year
the party fire within him had subsided. His
speech in 1934 was suggested and encouraged
by General McRae, who was then one of the
chief organizers of the Conservative party.
Senator Murphy was a friend of the then
government leader in this chamber, the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen. Their friendship had developed in earlier days in another
place, and between them there was a mutual
respect and affection based upon a common
racial origin, a love of letters, and comradeship borne of many years of parliamentary
service.
There were two events in the eventful
career of Charles Murphy outside of Parliament which put Canadians in his debt forever.
One was his organization and direction of the
Liberal convention of 1919. That gathering
chose Mr. King for the Liberal leadership.
The other great project with which his name
is associated was the placing in proper focus
of the career of Thomas D'Arcy McGee. In
this work he was not alone, and of those who
played a major role, the name of Mrs. Isabel
Skelton, McGee's biographer, will always be
essential to an understanding of the project.
Senator Murphy organized the McGee memorial dinner in 1925. That event was a source
of inspiration to public men, to scholars, and
to all who would understand the basic ideals
upon which Confederation was established.
In due time Senator Murphy published a collection of the McGee speeches, which also
constitutes a valuable historical record.
I would hope that honourable members will
not object if I say that I shall always feel
honoured by and be grateful for the friendship which he showed to me and for the great

DECEMBER 1. 1953

help he gave me when, as a young man, I
embarked upon my professional -career. And
I shall always be indebted to him for the
encouragement and inspiration he gave me
in connection with public affairs.
Charles Murphy's immediate predecessor in
this chamber was the Honourable M. J.
O'Brien. Senator O'Brien was perhaps not a
great parliamentarian, but that is in part due
to the fact that he was not here very long.
In this chamber, however, service and
achievement in fields other than the parliamentary are recognized when they have great
national significance. In this sense, while the
Senate is not an elective chamber, it nevertheless is and has been a truly representative
chamber.
Born in humble circumstances in Antigonish
county, Nova Scotia, a province prolific in its
contributions to Canadianism in many fields,
with his ingenuity, his industry, his integrity
and his courage, he played a large part in the
development of our natural resources, especially of the forest and of the mine, and he
played a considerable part in solving some of
the overwhelming problems of communication
which were inherent in the building of this
country in its earlier days. In the legends of
the valley of the Ottawa there are few
careers more noteworthy than that of M. J.
O'Brien. There is no career which brought
the people of that area and indeed of many
other areas more real wealth.
When Senator Sir Richard Scott died in
1913 he had devoted over sixty of his eightyeight years to public life. For forty years he
had been a member of this chamber, and for
twenty-seven of those years he was the leader
of the Liberal group here. For seventeen
years, while a member of this house, he
administered the portfolio of the Secretary of
State with distinction to that office, with
credit to the government of the day, and with
honour to the Senate. In 1934 Sir Allan
Aylesworth, then in his own right the dear
old man of parliament and of public life,
called Sir Richard "Dear old Mr. Scott"; and
I think this testifies to the esteem and the
affection in which he was held by his colleagues at the time he was here. For six
years Sir Richard was a member for Ottawa
in the first legislature of Ontario after 1867.
For two of those years he was Minister of
Crown Lands. He sat also for six years as
the member for Ottawa in the House of
Assembly of the United Provinces of Upper
and Lower Canada before Confederation. He
had been Mayor of Bytown prior to that
experience.
In looking back on his career one is struck
with the nunber of notable public projects
with which his name is associated. He was

the prime mover in securing the approval of
the legislature of the United Provinces to the
nomination of Ottawa as the capital of the
new Dominion, though I can well understand
why some honourable senators may not put
that achievement down to his credit! It is an
accomplishment, however, which Ottawans
view with approval. Legislation for which
Sir Richard was responsible removed a
monopoly situation which might have prevented Marconi from establishing his Atlantic
cable terminals in Nova Scotia.
Roman
Catholics in Ontario will ever cherish his
achievements on behalf of separate schools.
It may be long forgotten, but the experiences
of Churchill and Carson at the Admiralty in
the first world war, and their assertion of the
principle of civilian, of governmental, of parliamentary control and supremacy in matters
of policy touching the military, was anticipated by Sir Richard here, just before and just
after the turn of the century. One of the
measures which he advocated as a private
member of the Senate, the making of the
Supreme Court of Canada the court of final
resort for appeals from lower Canadian courts,
was prophetic of what has now come about.
I have spoken of four members of the
Senate who were representatives of the
people and of the tradition to which I must
be presumed to belong. I might have used a
longer list, but for my present purposes this,
I think, suffices.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, may I here in my
preoccupation with tradition pay a brief word
of respect to the representatives in this chamber of that race who discovered this land,
who wrested its first settlements from the
wilderness, who brought Christianity to its
shores, who peopled it and who remain to
help preserve it and to prosper in it. There
is a stability in our national life which has
sprung from the adherence of the French
people to their basic maxim Je me souviens.
What I say on this point is not rhetoric.
I am by choice and by original training a
civilian-a member of the Bar of Quebec
and a graduate of the Law School et the
University of Montreal.
The memory of an individual is sometimes
short, but the relations of two great peoples
are enshrined in the pages of history. However, I would like to place upon the records
of this chamber a tribute to the charity and
compassion shown in 1848, on the banks of

SENATE
the St. Lawrence, when the French-speaking
Canadians of that day took to their hearts
and their hearths so many of the Irish immigrants and so many of their orphaned
children who came to these shores through
Grosse Isle in overcrowded fever-laden ships.
I am fully aware of the debt my coreligionists owe to French-speaking Canadians
also for their struggle for political, religious
and educational rights. These fundamental
liberties we now enjoy, and I know it to be
a source of satisfaction to our fellow Canadians generally that we do. But we might
not have had them when we did had it not
been for the perseverance of Canadians of
French origin.

SENATE DIRECTORY
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I
would ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald if he would be good enough to
inquire and tell us when we may expect an
up-to-date list of the telephone and room
numbers of all senators. It is difficult to
locate honourable members without an upto-date directory. I notice that the other
house has already published an up-to-date
list of the telephone and room numbers
of its members.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I may say to the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that t am
astonished to learn the other place has an
up-to-date list, for it has been my experience,
in the short time I have been here, that we
are just a little ahead of the other house.
As to our list, I have already made inquiry
and I am assured by the Clerk Assistant that
it will be distributed some time this week.
SENATE FLOOR PLAN
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) when the
Senate floor plan will be completed and

DECEMBER 2, 1953
available? I have noticed on previous occasions that it has come to us late in the
session-frequently so late as not to be of
much use. It ought to be prepared immediately after the introduction of new members.
We need copies at once, even if for the
time being only mimeographed rather than
printed copies can be obtained.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In reply to the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck): my information, which I hope
is correct, is that the other place is not
ahead of us in this respect, and we shall
endeavour to keep ahead by having the
plan this week.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Good.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral's speech at the opening of the session

and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Honourable members,
having moved adjournment of the debate
yesterday, I feel you will all be disappointed
when I tell you that I am not going to
address you this afternoon. Yesterday the
honourable
member from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) was absent, and I, as the
whip of the small but important opposition,
was requested to move the adjournment of
the debate on her behalf. The lady member
is now present, and will address the house.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
perhaps I should say at the very beginning
that I am suffering from a throat disability.
It is a very serious handicap in a woman
and particularly when she has to make a
speech in public. I am saying this in advance
so that if my remarks come to an abrupt
close honourable senators will know there
is nothing more seriously wrong than that
I have lost my voice.
Honourable senators, in rising to speak for
a short time in this debate I would follow
the time-honoured custom of associating myself with those who have preceded me in
extending a warm welcome to the new members of the Senate, more particularly to the
new women members. I also want to congratulate our new Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), our new Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the mover
(Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) and the seconder (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
I would also associate myself with the
Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) in expressing my own personal
regret at the unavoidable absence of our
Leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). The honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg is very versatile.
He is always interesting and lively in debate,
and we miss him very much; but in our small
group we count ourselves fortunate in having
so able a deputy to carry on as is the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine).
Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. Fallis: In passing, I should like
to endorse a request which was made by
the honourable gentleman from Rosetown
when he took part in this debate. He requested the government to give consideration
again to broadening the field of exemptions
for medical expenses allowable as deductions
for income tax purposes. When my honourable colleague was speaking on this subject
it brought to my mind another factor which
some people think is m-ost unfair about
medical expenses.
I refer to the heavy
duty imposed upon imported American

SENATE
medical supplies of a kind not made in
Canada. I am one of those who believe in
buying Canadian goods if they are available,
but if I do buy an imported article which is
considered preferable, then I am perfectly
willing to pay the duty imposed upon it.
However, when an individual requires
medical supplies which are not manufactured
in Canada, I can see no reason for his having
to pay a duty of 30 per cent and upwards
when that article is imported from the United
States. I speak with some feeling on this
from my own personal experience, and I
know of many others who have had the same
experience.
Perhaps when the leader of
this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is using
his persuasive eloquence upon the government to induce them to accede to the request
of the honourable gentleman from Rosetown,
he might be good enough to refer to my
grievance at the same time.
I should like to compliment the honourable
leader upon the very able manner in which
he delivered his first speech in this house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Do not applaud too soon,
for I was about to hasten to add that I
could not find myself in agreement with
many of the sentiments which he expressed.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: However, he had my
wholehearted support when he said:

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Wheat problems are
always with us.
Personally, I found the Speech from the
Throne unusually dull and colourless, perhaps
because so much of the material that is contained there had already been discussed
widely in the press. But there is one item,
which although it has been mentioned before
in the house, I cannot pass without calling
attention to it, because I know it will receive
the unanimous support here: that is the one
which forecasts legislation to provide assistance for totally disabled persons of our
country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Some of the provinces
already have this legislation in their provincial domain. My own province of Ontario has
had it for some time, and we feel it meets
a real need. But some of the other provinces,
I believe, felt that they were not financially
in a position to carry the load alone. So we
ail welcome the fact that the federal government in this respect has followed the lead of
some of the provinces and at the present session is initiating this legislation on a national
basis.
But my chief purpose in rising this afternoon was to say a few words about the advent
of more women members to this house and its
significance here; and may I say to the honIn the other house there are now four lady ourable senators

Weil, I regret very much that circumstances have flot yet permitted us to remedy

No. 1, by having more women in the Senate.
I was quite amused when I came back here
this session. The very first day I was back
more than one of my maie colleagues, in
speaking to me of the increased representation of women in the Senate, said, "Weil, I
hope you are satisfied n'ow". I do not thînk
I couid go quite that far. I arn pieased, yes,
that there are more women in this chamber,
but the fact that we number five out of a
total membership of 102, to me does not constitute the iast word on this subi ect. However, it, is a good beginning, and I think it
is very encouraging, because it is a sign of
an awakening consciousness on the part of
the powers-that-be to the fact that Canada
has for too long been dragging its feet aiong
this line. We ail acknowiedge that Canada
is a progressive nation and has given outstanding leadership ai'ong many uines, but not
in the recognition of its women. For example,
the women of Canada received a franchise
only at the close of the First Worid War,
although for many years prior to the outbreak of the war Norway, Finiand and New
Zeaiand had ail given their women full

equality with men.
was the first country in the worid to grant
representation in parliament to its women,
and has really been taking the lead ever
since. I have not the latest figures on the
number of women in Finland's parliament,
but two or three years ago forty of its 200
members were women, one of whom had
been chosen to be Minister of Health, Welfare and Social Services. Just the other day
I noticed a press item which predicted that
in the new State of Israel a woman who is
now Minister of Labour will be named as
Israel's Prime Minister. So we in Canada
stili have a lot of catching up to do.
In rnoving the Address in reply to the
Speech frorn the Throne the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) spoke of
the work of the United Nations and the great
interest taken by wornen in the activities
there. That women have an interest equal
to that of men in the vital question of peace
and war-which, after ail, is the basic and
fundamental issue underlying ail foreign
policy-is, I think, conceded by everyone.
That being the case, it seems to me only
logical that every country should give to its
women adequate representation at ail important international gatherings. Canada does
flot do this and has neyer done it, and so I

arn today making an urgent plea: that, beginning now, those who are in authority and
have the power to do so should give to some
of our able younger women in the political
arena, irrespective of their political affiliation,
opportunities for observation and training in
the field of external affairs. If this is done
Canada too might, in the near future, have
her Eleanor Roosevelt or her Madame Pandit
in the international field.
The honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) in her very able
speech, when referring to the work which
the women members do in this house, or in
sîmilar bodies in which they find themselves,
quoted Mrs. Roosevelt as saying that women
will aimost always seek to co-operate, while
men rnay be more inclined to seek to
dominate. In commenting on that staternent
the honourable Leader of the Government in
this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) demonstrated that the age of chivalry is not yet
dead, when hie replied:
Let me assure ber (the honourable senator) that
our attitude wili be co-operation and collaboration
ever. but domination neyer.

Those words seemed to ring a bell in my
subconscious mind and sent me ieafing
tbrough the pages of Hansard, and I came
across some remarks I made here when this
subject was under discussion a couple of
years ago. If I may be permitted to read a
few sentences, perhaps they would dispel
any doubt or fear in the mind of the honourable senator from Fredericton as to the position of women in this chamber.
I quote from Hansard of May 3, 1951, page
353:
For years after rny appointment to this bouse.
while speaking at women's organizations of varjous kinds 1 have dozens of times been asked:

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I am sure the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) has realized the truth of my
remarks and has seen proof of them in the
short time she has been in this bouse, for
scarcely had she been sworn in when she
became an active member of the hardworking divorce committe.
In closing, honourable senators, may I
leave with you one further thought. I am
sure every honourable senator will agree
that the women of Canada have given a
good account of themselves in the business
and professional life of this country, in the
field of education, and in high administrative
positions to which they have been called by
various governments; and I am equally sure
that the three outstanding women who have
recently come here, representing different
geographical divisions or sections of this
country, will make a very worth-while contribution to the work of this house and they
may be assured that in the performance of
their duties here they will have the good
will and support of all honourable senators,
regardless of party affiliation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert:
Honourable
senators, I should like to take advantage of
the opportunity afforded by the debate on
the Speech from the Throne to discuss a
subject which not only relates to the social
and economic welfare of our own country but
is rapidly presenting a serious challenge to
western civilization itself. I refer to the
pollution and contamination of our lakes,
rivers and streams. Typifying this problem,
I wish to mention especially conditions affecting this capital city of Ottawa and the surrounding federal district.
Before enlarging upon this subject, I would
join with those who have already spoken in
offering felicitations to the new Speaker (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and the new Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) upon their elevation to their high
offices.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am sure they will
enjoy their respective posts, and I feel also
that the Senate in return will be stimulated
and helped thereby in the accomplishment

of its sessional work.

To the mover (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) and the
seconder (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, I
would also extend congratulations upon their
excellent contributions to the records of this
chamber. I should like to take time to discuss some matters raised by other honourable
senators who have spoken in this debate but

I shall forgo that privilege until an opportunity arises later to discuss such questions
as the labour relations problem referred to
by my honourable friend from Cochrane (Hon.
Mr. Bradette).
I should like, however, to say without invidious distinction that I appreciated very
much the address given in the bouse yesterday by my junior colleague ffrom the city of
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Connolly). He is, I believe,
the youngest member of this house. His speech
recalled very clearly to my mind the day,
fifteen or sixteen years ago, when I had to
appear here and make some remarks on the
Speech from the Throne. In his references
to historic figures who have preceded us as
members of this house he conformed, I think,
to the best traditions of parliament. Possibly
too few allusions of that kind are made in
this chamber. After all, parliamentaary institutions draw a great deal of their strength
and their inspiration from the examples set
by such notable men as those of whom he
spoke yesterday.
In the Speech from the Throne reference
is made to the fact that
Canada has continued to contribute

to those

international projects which will promote human
welfare and thereby remove some of the causes of

unrest and dislocation.

Beside this statement I should like to place
a quotation from the preamble to the constitution of the World Health Organization. These
words are prominently displayed in the outer
office of our Minister of National Health and
Welfare:
The health of all peoples is fundamental to the
attainment of peace and security and is dependent
upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and
states.

These two extracts, with a slight but impor-

tant addition form the basis of what I want
to say today. In the latter quotation I would
insert "cleanliness" before "health", so that
the declaration by the World Health Organization would read: "The cleanliness and health
of all peoples are fundamental to the attainment of peace and security . . . . ...
Under these broad general terms I should
like to give realistic meaning to a certain
phase of this so-called human welfare as it
applies to our own country, having in mind
that, like charity, these great international
movements for human betterment, to be
effective, must begin at home.
Of the abundant natural resources with
which Canada has been blessed, none is more
important and vital than our fresh water
rivers, streams and lakes. We take them so
much for granted that their volume and
quality are rarely questioned.
Yet the
growth of population and the rapid and varied
expansion of industry, particularly in the two

DECEMBER 2, 1953
central provinces of Ontario and Quebec, are
beginning to raise serious problems of pollution and contamination which threaten to
affect the sanitation and the economic and
social welfare of large areas of this country.
Three different classes of water area corne
within the scope of Canadian jurisdiction.
First, international boundary waters, represented by the Great Lakes and certain rivers,
are within the purview of the International
Joint Commission of Canada and the United
States. Second, interprovincial waters such
as the Ottawa river are subject to co-operation between provincial departments of
government where considerations of health
and sanitation are concerned, and to the
supervision of federal authority where any
phase of navigation is directly involved.
Third, there are those local streams and
rivers which are wholly within the jurisdiction of municipalities and the provinces.
In the international field much effective
work has already been done by the International Joint Commission. The Boundary
Waters Treaty of 1909 bound Canada and the
United States in a stipulated undertaking
that:
Boundary waters and waters flowing across the
boundary shall not be polluted on either side to
the injury of health or property on the other side.

In 1913 a reference from both governments
was made to the Joint Commission asking
for an investigation into the condition of
boundary waters, and a report was made containing a recommendation for remedial
measures, but the outbreak of World War I
delayed action on such measures. No further
investigation was undertaken until 1946, when
another reference relating to the same subject was made by the governments of Canada
and the United States. By that reference
attention was called particularly to the waters
of the St. Clair river, Lake St. Clair and the
Detroit river, which were being polluted by
sewage and industrial wastes emptied directly
into those waters. Later this reference was
enlarged to include the St. Mary's river at
Sault Ste. Marie, and the Niagara river.
The character of these investigations and
the results arising out of them are clearly outlined in the annual reports of the International Joint Commission. A board of technical advisers was set up to advise the commission, and to undertake the actual field
work that had to be done. Four members
from the United States and four from Canada
composed it: R. J. Menzies from the Department of National Health and Welfare and
A. E. Berry of the Ontario Department of
Health were our leading representatives.
The conclusions reached in this inquiry
showed that the waters under reference in

all three areas were being polluted on either
side of the boundary to the injury of health
and property on the other side of the boundary, owing to the discharge of domestic
sewage and industrial wastes along the shores
of the boundary waters and of the streams
tributary thereto. Vessels engaged in freight
and passenger traffic were also responsible
for the discharge of much sewage and other
wastes.
As a result of the report that was made
to the International Joint Commission arising
out of the reference of 1946, recommendations were made to the two respective federal
governments, asking that remedial measures
to overcome and offset present and future
defilement of boundary waters be put into
effect. The matter of jurisdiction on both
sides of the line has been satisfactorily adjusted through co-operation between federal
and local governments. Industry, too, has
co-operated generously with government
authorities in dealing with this problem. The
Canadian chairman of the Joint Commission
has said that industry along the boundary
waters has voluntarily spent a hundred million dollars in scientific research and actual
sewage disposal plants to help lessen the evils
of pollution.
Much scientific data is involved in a
thorough discussion of this subject. The work
that was initiated by the International Joint
Commission and the Departments of Public
Health in the provinces and in Ottawa has
provided a great fund of technical information which really needs to be simplified and
clarified for public understanding. The fact
remains, however, that work done in the
international waters over the past ten years
has aroused widespread interest in this
subject as applied to interprovincial and local
problems of sewage disposal as well as to the
international areas. Much credit is due to
the Ontario Department of Health and its
energetic and efficient engineer, Mr. Berry,
for the effort that is being made to have every
municipality in this province provide scientific
disposal plants as a means of protecting
streams and rivers and lakes from defilement.
The Grand River and the Thames River
valleys are now the scenes of concentrated
attention and development on the part of
the provincial government in diverting from
those waterways a rapidly increasing amount
of domestic and industrial wastage.
I want to deal now with a situation that
exists at our very doors, in the adjacent
waters of the Ottawa River. If I should
elaborate upon this particular scene it is
because it represents a wide national interest
as well as a local one. The development
here of a fine capital city surrounýded by a
federal district area of great natural beauty

SENATE
has been gradually taking form during the
past fifty years. An accelerated interest
was given to this project in 1944, when a
joint committee of both houses of parliament
was appointed to inquire into relations between the federal government and the
municipality of the city of Ottawa and adjoining municipalities. A unanimous report
was finally presented and adopted in both
houses recommending on behalf of all the
people of Canada that the Federal District
Commission Act should be amended so as to
give the Federal District Commission all
possible powers to proceed with suggested
plans for development in and around this
capital city.
The urgent need of a sewage disposal plant
was emphasized, and reference was made to
"the present reckless system of sewage disposal into the Ottawa river, the both banks
of which, within the most directly affected
area, are the property of the Dominion of
Canada".
In the years that have followed that report
and the conclusion of the last war, the population of the municipality of Greater Ottawa
has grown far beyond 200,000. The projected
growth within the next twenty-five years
indicates a population of 300,000. These
figures are embodied in a special report that
was made in 1950 by Messrs. Gore and
Storrie, consulting engineers, to officials of
the municipality and of the Federal District
Commission on the subject of water supply
and sewage disposal. Naturally, the situation
in the river that was found obnoxious some
nine years ago has become greatly aggravated, but no disposal plant has yet been
established to alleviate this bad condition.
Following the report of Messrs. Gore and
Storrie, and in accord with its recommendation, a site of some 320 acres at Green's
Creek, just east of Ottawa, has been acquired
for the erection of such a plant to serve the
Ontario side of the river. The total capital
expenditure on this project will be shared
by the Federal District Commission, but as
yet no work has been initiated on constructing a necessary large interceptor sewer from
below Chaudiere Falls to the proposed sewage
disposal plant, or on the plant itself.
While the need for betterment in this
respect is great, problems of engineering and
finance in meeting this need on the Ottawa
river also are great. Not only are the municipality 'of Ottawa and the Ontario side of
the river involved, but also the city of Hull
and the Quebec side of the river are affected.
The capital cost of an adequate sewage
disposal system in this area is too great for
any one municipality to bear. The obvious

need for inter-provincial and federal co-operation in getting something done soon should
receive concentrated attention from the
necessary governmental authorities.
Meanwhile, we are confronted with the
rather ironic spectacle of a visionary plan for
the reorganization and beautification of our
capital city-enshrined as it has been in the
plaster of paris model that has been exhibited
throughout the length and breadth of this
country-being all delayed and even seriously
threatened by seeming inability to clean up
our river and to prevent it from befouling
the very district upon which the people of
Canada have already spent millions of dollars
to improve and beautify. By the end of this
fiscal year some $28 million will have been
appropriated and spent by the federal government through its Federal District Commission in trying to make a capital area here
which will reflect the national pride and
aspirations of our people.
It is not necessary here to enlarge upon the
details of this nasty situation, involving as
it does the unspeakably filthy state of the
lower Ottawa river with the low level of its
waters that has prevailed throughout the
most of this year. Not long ago the local press
gave publicity to a formal protest by one of
our foreign ambassadors against the almost
intolerable conditions which were affecting his
official household and office by reason of
too close proximity to the polluted waters
of the Ottawa river. Between the Chaudiere
Falls on the west to the city's limits on the
east, a distance of not over four miles, raw
sewage is being emptied into this river from
twenty different outlets, with a consequent
damage to fish, plant and bird life, and with
most unpleasant pollution of the surrounding
atmosphere.
At this stage it is, I think, advisable to
refer to the uncertainty of the flow in these
rivers due to the condition that exists in the
watersheds feeding the rivers, and the lack
of sufficient water in the different seasons
to perform the necessary functions of the
river in meeting the demands that are made
upon it. That variation is in prospect of
being much aggravated as the result of the
building of power dams, which will have the
effect of increasing the volume of water in
certain places and decreasing the flow in
others. We have the Des Joachims Dam in
the Upper Ottawa, where a vast reservoir
is now formed. The prospect is that at the
Carillon Falls, sixty miles east of here, another
dam will be built in the near future for the
purpose of developing 500,000 horse power, the
effect of which will be to create a stagnant
body of water sixty miles back as far as
the city of Ottawa. I mention these things

DECEMBER 2. 1953
simply because they have a very direct bearing on the question of proper precautions
being taken to relieve these areas from further
pollution and contamination.
In short, one might say that the lower
regions of the Ottawa river present at this
time the most outstanding example of an open
trunk sewer to be found anywhere in Canada,
and its effect is to make a mockery of the
beautiful site on which successive governments, as well as the people of the whole
country, have envisaged an ideal capital city
and district.
Fortunately, the threat from industrial
waste is not a serious factor in this area,
since legislation was passed some years ago
forbidding the dumping of sawdust and byproducts from lumber mills into the rivers
and streams. But so rapid is the expansion
of modern industry in the field of chemistry
and atomic energy that the discharge of
industrial wastes presents a prospect of continued vigilance for the engineers and scientists in government departments of health
and welfare. Public opinion may well keep
abreast of such development: and members
of parliament and legislatures can do no
better thing than to afford every opportunitfor inquiry and information in this field. If
for no other reason than to check this growing problem, I believe that the existence of
government departments of health and welfare
are fully justified.
We sometimes think that the Department of
Social Welfare expends a vast amount of
money, but I would remind honourable senators that the prospect of acute scientific
problems arising in the years ahead out of
industrialization by modern science requires
the application of all the intelligence and
scientific knowledge that can be devoted to
them.
This subject, to my knowledge, has never
been discussed in this chamber before. But
in the other place, in 1949, owing to a
condition that arose along the shores of
Lake Ontario bordering the city of Toronto,
the member for York West, Mr. Rodney
Adamson, introduced an amendment to the
Navigable Waters Act, in the hope that
something might be done to increase the
jurisdiction of the dominion in dealing with
water pollution. It was by amendment to
that Act that the provision was made regarding the discharge of sawdust and by-products
of lumber mills in rivers. Mr. Adamson
endeavoured to have that application made
wider so as to offset the increasing evidence
of discharge in Ashbridge's Bay and along
the western shores of the lake. It will be
remembered that his appeal was given added
strength by reason of an unfortunate dis-

charge of oil sludge that rendered beaches
and shore waters of the lake near Toronto
completely useless for bathing and other
pleasures normally enjoyed by the population. Havoc to bird and fish life along those
shore waters also occurred. The amendment
introduced by Mr. Adamson in the other
place was not concurred in, because of a
point of jurisdiction which suggested that the
case rested with the province of Ontario and
the municipality of Toronto. I think, without
having definite information before me at the
moment, that steps were taken locally to
prevent a recurrence of - that evil.
I referred earlier to the report that was
produced about ten years ago by the joint
committee of both houses dealing with the
work of the Federal District Commission. It
seems to me that it would be most timely if
the government would take steps to set up
such a committee again to review the
progress that has been made under the Federal District Commission Act during recent
years, and also to inquire into this important
problem of water pollution and sewage disposal. If a joint committee from both houses
is not feasible again, then I would suggest
that one of our own standing committees,
either the Committee on Public Health and
Welfare or the Committee on Natural
Resources, might undertake this very useful
task in the near future.
In conclusion, I would return to the broad
statement which I made at the beginning of
my remarks about this question of pollution
and contamination being a challenge to
modern civilization itself. Anything that I
have said about conditions in the Ottawa
river relates to that larger picture. Speaking
recently at a conference of chemical engineers in the city of New York, Mr. J. R.
Menzies, of the Department of National
Health and Welfare in Canada, said:
We must ask ourselves if the time is approaching
when every drop of water that falls to earth will
be polluted or contaminated. The rapid increase
in population and the tremendous expansion of
industry suggests this as a distinct possibility.

If these words do not constitute a challenge
to modern civilization they would seem to
have very little meaning indeed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE PETITIONS AND STATISTICS
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

CONCURRED

IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce Nos. 23 to 67, both inclusive, dealing
with petitions for divorce.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Committee, moved that the reports be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, may I take
advantage of this motion to give the house
some information as to the progress being
made by the divorce committee?
To date 294 petitions have been filed, and
the date of filing does not expire until
Wednesday, December 23. Although petitions
are still being received, they are not coming
in as rapidly as at the opening of the session; however, we may reasonably expect
that the number received this session will
exceed 300 and perhaps go as high as 350.
Some eighty-one petitions have already been
recommended, and six have been withdrawn,
leaving 207 applications to be heard, along
with those which will come in between now
and December 23.
Honourable senators will note the very
considerable progress that has been made
in the work of the committee since the opening of the session. I wish to say how much
I appreciate the excellent attendance of
members of the committee. We have had two
committees sitting simultaneously five days
a week, hearing a total of approximately ten
to twelve applications a day. I expect that
this coming week we shall have three committees sitting at the one time, and I have
just asked the honourable members of the
committee to make every effort to attend
on Monday next. Their attendance will
enable us to keep the regular mill going
on the undefended applications, while at the
same time we devote one committee to the
hearing of defended applications.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable senator if all the eighty-odd cases which
have already been recommended were undefended?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: So far all the petitions
have been undefended.
My thought is-and I am sure it will meet
with concurrence in this house-to divide
the committee members into as many subcommittees as possible, and thereby dispose
of our work early in the session. In that way
the members of that committee will be
relieved of what is more or less drudgery
and be free to take part in other committees,
which have somewhat intensive sittings
towards the end of every session.
I am beginning to understand the burden
that my friend the senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) carried throughout his
ten-year tenure on the divorce committee;
and I want to thank him for substituting for
me as chairman on one or two occasions
when it has not been possible for me to be
present.
This information will bring honourable
senators up to date on the progress of the
committee. I do not think the task is as
hopeless as some of us may at one time have
thought it was.
The motion was agreed to, and the reports
were concurred in.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before entering into the discussion on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Tbrone, there are certain amenities which, as
a representative of British Columbia, I should
like to observe. And so, Monsieur le Président, I want to begin by paying my compliments to you. giving you my sincere
congratulations upon your elevation from the
leadership of the bouse to the speakership.

I can assure you that I do not expect you will
have any more trouble with me than your
predecessor had.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Be that as it may, I think
I voice the sentiments of us ail in saying
that we are deligbted to see you holding
sucb a high position.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Next, may I off er the new
leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
my sincere congratulations. It was my good
fortune to know him when botb of us were
in the other place, and, echoing wbat has
been said in compliment to bim, I would say
that I know be will bring to this bonourable
chamber the same intelligence, tact, and
desire to carry on the business of the bouse
as he did wben he was Speaker of the House
of Commons. However, perbaps by înadvertence, a new bonour has been bestowed upon
him, for I have noticed that various senators
have referred to him as "the leader of the
government in tbe Senate". Now, bonourable members, he is not that, he is leader of
the Senate in the government. Tbe two things
may sound the same, but there is quite a
difference and quite a distinction, and I trust
the new appellation will not be repeated, for
it may leave the impression with many that
tbe government is really running the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Isn't it?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was pleased to bear the
leader say that he would try to have more
legislation introduced in this chamber, that
he would take full interest in the work of
the Senate and endeavour to give it tbe kind
of leadership it bas had throughout many
long years.
At this time I sbould like to say a word
about the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), for I feel it means sometbing to
our colleagues wbo are ili wben we pause
in our deliberations to remember tbem. None
of us lîke to be forgotten, so I would request
the acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) to kindly convey to bis leader
my personal regards, and the hope that be
will soon return to good bealtb and again
take bis place in this chamber.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I say to the acting
Leader of the Opposition. that be need offer
no apologies for the way i wbich *he is
conducting tbe affairs of bis pai-ty i the
Senate. He is doing an excellent job, and
we ahl admire bis leadership.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I also, at this time,
extend a welcome to the new senators, particularly the lady members. While the mover
(Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne was speaking,
I wondered exactly what was in her mind
when she reaffirmed the old Biblical statement that it is not good for man to live
alone. I looked around me and I saw 'at
least one bachelor in our midst, and my mind
strayed a little and I wondered just what
kind of problem would arise if-but I need
say no more.
I am sure everyone will agree with me
when I say that the new members who have
taken part in the debate so far acquitted
themselves splendidly. I extend to them the
best of good wishes for their future careers
in this great chamber.
I listened with a great deal of interest to
the speech made yesterday by the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). While I am not going to enter into
a discussion at this time regarding the pollution of the Ottawa river, I want to say that
I heartily agree with the honourable gentleman's proposal that a committee be set up
to review the progress that has been made
by the Federal District Commission in its
work, which affects Canada as a whole and
Ottawa in particular. I had the honour of
serving years ago on the International Joint
Commission to which the honourable senator referred yesterday, and I feel safe in
saying that that commission did a lot of
good.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The fact that some of its
recommendations have not been carried out
is a matter well worth inquiring into.
The acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) and some of his colleagues have
spoken about the wheat situation in this
debate. I am not going to answer themi now.
In a speech that I made here last session I
stated that many wheat farmers in the prairie
provinces were living the life of Riley-but',
lo and behold, the press quoted me as saying
that farmers as a whole were living the life
of Riley. I did not speak of farmers generally. What I said was that many wheat
farmers in the prairie provinces were living
the life of Riley, and I do not retract one
word of that statement. I do believe that
statement is true, but it does not apply to
all farmers.
I was rather interested in what the acting
Leader of the Opposition said about wheat,
and particularly in his statement that the
farmers do not want any subsidy; but before
he concluded his remarks he said that if
wheat dropped below 50 cents a bushel the
government would have to come to their

assistance. I wondered if he meant that a
subsidy would be needed then or not; because,
as I see it, if the price of wheat dropped
below 50 cents and the government were
called upon for assistance, the assistance
would be a subsidy. I think honourable
senators will agree with me when I say that,
in my opinion, the placing of a guaranteed
price on farm products has confronted the
United States and Canada with a problem
that we had never dreamt of. I remember
appealing during the war years to the Minister
of Agriculture to guarantee a special price
to encourage production of eggs by poultrymen in British Columbia. His reply was
applicable to what is now taking place in
connection with certain farm products, both
in the United States and Canada. The minister said that if the government guaranteed
a price on eggs the farmers would produce
so many for the market that it would be a
grave problern to know what to do with
them.
If for any agricultural product a
guaranteed price were set, somewhat above
the cost of production, as has been done for
certain farm products in the United States,
we would find the farmers producing for the
market in abundance. Just what the solution
to that problem would be, I am not going
to say, other than that I am heartily in
accord with statements of the Minister of
Agriculture that the curtailment of acreage
is not the solution. As I have said, new
problems have been brought about by guaranteed prices, and unless we are prepared to
give away some of our agricultural produce
it will be very difficult indeed to know how
to maintain prices and find or maintain ample
markets.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake,
(Hon. Mr. Horner) mentioned something about
juvenile deliquency, and I am quite in accord
with what he said, but I would point out
to him and all honourable senators that
whilst there has been a great increase in
juvenile deliquency and one might be tempted
to blame youth entirely, the fact remains
that our older people have changed too.
Many fathers and mothers are not giving the
attention or care to, nor have they control
over, their families that parents had when the
honourable senator and I were young.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No; there was no baby

bonus then.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is perfectly true that
there was no baby bonus then; but I know
that I echo the voices of many people when I
say that it would have meant a lot to them,
as it would have meant to the humble home
in which I was raised, if the baby bonus
had been available then.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

DECEMBER 3, 1953
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was astounded by a report
published the other day that more than 11
per cent of Canada's penitentiary population
were juveniles under the age of twenty years.
This startling figure emphasizes the need for
giving more consideration to this problem
today than was given in the past. Certainly
the problem will not be cured if we continue
simply to lock up young people in our prisons
with older and more experienced law
breakers.
I am wondering also whether our educational system may not have something to do
with juvenile delinquency. It is my belief
that although we have changed our ways of
living, and are supposedly living in an
enlightened age, over the centuries human
beings have not changed much, if any; in
other words, in spite of our so-called high
standard of living and enlightened age, the
people of today are not very dissimilar to
people of the early ages.
I read a report of a recent lecture given
by Miss Dorothy Ryan to a parent-teacher's
association meeting in this city, and I was
rather astounded to note ber statement that
the child should be allowed freedom of choice.
I am not altogether surprised that someone
who still bears the title of "Miss", and bas
never had the duty of rearing children, would
make such a statement as that. But what, I
wonder, would the fathers and mothers who
attended that meeting think of the suggestion
that their children should be allowed to have
their own way and do what they liked? If
that is the doctrine being preached today, it
is little wonder that the youth are getting out
of hand and becoming disrespectful.
As was pointed out in a book which I
recently read, we are devoting too much
time to the training of persons to be teachers
only, without scholarly or cultural achievements; in other words, teachers are being
trained, not educated. Not long ago I noticed
a statement which I shall pass on to you for
what it is worth, not knowing whether it
comes from a poet, philosopher or cynic. I
quote:
Education is sornetimes called the inculcation of
the incomprehensible into the ignorant by the
incompetent.

Honourable senators, I do not intend to deal
at any length with the White case or the
Gouzenko controversy, other than to say that
I think many of the speeches and utterances
made with regard to these questions have
been quite out of place. It must be remembered that we in Canada are very close
neighbours with the United States, and much
that we say is taken literally there. The same
cannot be said of the relations of the United
States with Great Britain and Europe, some

3,000 miles away. It is my belief that much
of what has been said on this subject borders
on political interference in the international
realm.
I was interested in the comments of one
reporter who visited the United States Senate
Internal Security Committee inquiry through
the medium of television, when he said that
everything in the committee room was as
clear as day, except the truth. I hope that
we do not follow the United States -and bring
television into our houses of parliament or
into our committees, for if we do men and
women will largely become actors. Although
I am not saying anything against those who
do appear on television, it has been said
that ex-President Truman himself was induced to appear on television to answer
certain accusations because millions of people
would see -and hear his presentation. Anyone familiar with what goes on across the
border knows that everybody is out for a
good show, and frequently the participants
in public affairs are not only speakers but
actors as well. In that way the truth is
sometimes hidden and very often is stretched.
I repeat my hope that television will not
come into the Senate or the other place. In
my humble opinion television could become
a mixed and doubtful blessing.
I turn now, honourable senators, to discuss
some of the proposed legislation outlined in
the Speech from the Throne, and I shall deal
particularly with the matter of pipe lines.
Before launching into that subject may I say
how pleased I was to learn that the dominion
government had decided to get out of the
telephone business in the interior of British
Columbia. To be honest, I never thought I
would live long enough to see a government
get out of a business, once it was in it. It
bas been said that if one hired a man to
shovel snow in front of the parliament buildings, and returned in ten years to see how
the shoveller was doing, he would find there
a three-storey office building, with stenographers, superintendents and managers for
the one man shovelling snow.
Sone Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Reid: Probably in the early days
private enterprise was reluctant to face the
-cost of telephone service in the interior of
British Columbia, and so the government
served a need by giving service there.
I come now to the decision of the government with respect to the proposed pipe lines
for natural gas, both east and west. I cannot quite understand what the government
are getting at: on the one hand, they say
they are in favour of an all-Canadian route
for a gas pipe line; and, on the other hand,
with respect to oil pipe lines, they have no

SENATE
regard as to where the oil may go. For
instance, an oil pipe line has been constructed
from Edmonton to Vancouver, a distance of
718 miles, at a cost of $93 million.
Hon. Mr. Wood: $96 million.
Hon. Mr. Reid: By the end of the year
that twenty-four-inch pipe line will be able
to deliver some 160,000 barrels a day. About
a hundred miles short of Vancouver the company intend laying a tributary pipe line leading down to the United States, where
American interests are prepared to construct
a $5 million or $10 million refinery to take
part of the oil deliveries. Yet nothing has
been said by the Transport Board or the
federal government about oil shipments out
of Canada. When it comes to natural gassomething which many districts could do
without-much has been said about an allCanadian market for Canadian gas. I hope
the government will give a second or perhaps
even a third look, at their decision in that
respect. It must be remembered that we in
British Columbia may never have natural
gas if this policy continues. The population
of Greater Vancouver is not large enough to
pay for a $120 million gas pipe line.
It is my opinion, honourable senators, that
we should try to serve all our people with
the cheapest kind of fuel, and I trust the
government will give some consideration to
the adoption of a system in effect across the
line, where the supply goes into a grid and
is then distributed. Gas from northern
British Columbia and Alberta could very
well be handled in this way. It is well
known that Providence, when creating this
continent, placed some things in the east
which are required in the north and some
in the west of the continent that should go
south. But we intervened with an imaginary
boundary line. The people in the east should,
I contend, be supplied with gas from the
United States and we, in turn, if supplies of
gas in northern British Columbia and
Alberta are abundant, should make this
available not only to the people of British
Columbia but also to the people of Washington and other districts south of the line. I
trust the government will not take too strong
a stand on the principle that all these supplies of natural gas must be restricted to
Canadians, particularly when, in the case of
petroleum products and oil, exportation to
the United States is allowed. To this I do
not object, for if we cannot use all the oil
that is being produced and flowing through
a pipe line to Vancouver, we should not
begrudge our neighbours a share of it.
Some of the measures which have been
taken lately do not find favour with those

of us who believe in private industry, among
whom I include myself. The consumers, the
people, in my opinion should receive first
consideration from the government.
I shall not enter at length into the controversy between the Trans-Canada Air
Lines and the Canadian Pacific Air Lines.
But in this connection may I make it clear
that I am not taking the attitude of a laisserfaire liberalism. We have moved a long
way into a new era, and this requires some
change in our views and our philosophy.
But if we believe in private enterprise-and
I use the word "private" rather than "free"
because there is a definite distinction-we
should give serious consideration to the
application of the Canadian Pacific Air Lines.
I understand very well the government's
position. They pioneered T.C.A., and the
growth of air traffic is making this line a
serious competitor with both railways, particularly the Canadian National. But has our
thinking on these matters so changed that
we are to refuse to allow a private company
to participate in this business because we
fear it will go broke? Since when has it been
the duty of a government to consider whether
a person or a company will go broke? If that
is to be our new pattern of thinking, I should
like to hear some definite official statement
on it. I have protested loudly in my own
province against infringements of this kind,
based on provincial regulations. In my district I would not be allowed either a taxi
licence or a trucking licence. As I pointed
out last session, a man in our neighbourhood
was fined for providing better milk than
was being sold generally to the public. If I
want a taxi licence I must go before a board,
and most likely would be refused because,
as the board would say, "There is a taxi business two miles away, and we believe you
would go broke". Is it any concern of any government whether I succeed or fail? Do they
no longer believe in free private enterprise?
Is it not my affair whether I put my money
in a taxi service or a trucking business? As
regards Trans-Canada Air Lines, admittedly
they have pioneered in Canadian flying services; but I venture to say that honourable senators present could mention many
instances of pioneers in this or that type
of private enterprise who later found themselves confronted with competition and
accepted it, without a thought of asking any
government to prohibit it. That is the way
we have conducted our business life ever
since I came to this country-and, if it would
interest anyone to know the year it was
1909. But what I cannot understand about
the air line issue is this: there may be some
grounds for the government's decision to

DECEMBER 3, 1953
refuse a licence to the Canadian Pacific Air
Lines to fly cargo planes from Vancouver to
Winnipeg, but for the life of me I cannot
understand why the Canadian governmentor T.C.A.-should be in the business of flying
people into Mexico. Canadian Pacific Air
Lines are operating into Mexico, and TransCanada Air Lines got into some trouble with
the United States authorities, which has not
yet been cleared up, about picking up passengers, I believe at Tampa, on the way to
Mexico.
So if the government is to go further into
the sphere of private business, let us know
about it, and let those of us who believe in
free private enterprise tell them they are
wrong. I have always held that, as regards
most lines of business, there should be as
little government participation as possible.
I want to say a word or two regarding
requests which have come from municipalities for government aid. I know that changes
are proposed in the direction of providing
increased payments for government buildings
within a municipality. But first may I
remark that I was rather surprised at the
statement, which is credited to the leader
of the Progressive Conservatives, that political parties should enter into contests for
municipal office. As one who has had quite
a few years of municipal experience, I h'old,
and I think most honourable members will
agree, that the less political partisanship
enters into local municipal affairs, the better.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The C.C.F. tried to get into
local politics. Not long ago they used to run
candidates under their official banner, but
they are not doing it any longer, because
they discovered that the people of this country do not take kindly to that type of
dictation. I am opposed to political parties
contesting for municipal office and I hope
the rank and file of the Progressive Conservative party do not take their leader's suggestion very seriously. While I am on the
subject of municipalities I should like to say
that the time has come when the relationship
between municipal and provincial governments and the federal government should be
completely reviewed. Some provinces are
exceedingly well off today, and it is surprising they have done so little for their
municipalities. Just look at the province of
Alberta, whose treasury has reaped a harvest
of more than $220 million from its oil and gas
rights during the last seven and a half years.
Alberta is sitting with more money than is
required to wipe 'out its entire provincial
debt. During the last election campaign in

British Columbia I made the statement that
no provincial government has treated its
municipalities more poorly than has the
Social Credit government of Alberta. It is
rather significant, however, that whenever
the members of the Social Credit group of
the other house come through our province
they criticize the federal government for not
doing enough for Canada's municipalities.
What happens when a calamitous flood or
fire destroys a large number of homes and
properties and the province concerned is
unable to take care of its people? The rest
of Canada is asked to come to the aid of
these people, and the federal government is
called upon to make special grants. But
when it comes to a matter of natural
resources, the provinces claim these for themselves and want to have full control over
them.
I pass now to health insurance, a subject
introduced during this debate by the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw). I wish to compliment him upon
making a fine speech, which was both interesting and educational. At this time I want
to place certain figures before the house,
for I am somewhat perturbed about the
increased demand that has arisen from opposition parties for a national health insurance
plan. This seems to be one of the most
popular subjects on which they voice themselves. I wonder how many honourable
senators know that Mr. Joliffe, the former
leader of the C.C.F. party in Ontario, told
his followers at their last meeting that if they
ever hoped to get votes they had better stop
talking about social welfare and think up
something new. He said that the Liberal
party, with its old-age security program, had
really stolen the thunder of the C.C.F. party,
and he advised the C.C.F. to start advocating
a national health insurance plan, and to
point out the health benefits enjoyed by the
people of other countries.
At the present time there is a drive by
certain trade unions, by opposition parties
and by others to make it appear that the
federal authorities have been derelict in their
duties in not jumping into a health insurance
program of some kind. I have listened to
many speeches on the subject, but I have
not yet heard one that has set out just what
the speaker meant by health insurance. Generally speaking, I think its principal benefit
is hospitalization. But if this is what it means,
then British Columbia's experience in this
matter should serve to warn us from jumping too hastily into any national hospitalization scheme. The British Columbia plan is

SENATE

A patient entering a hospital often feels that
no one is especially concerned about him as
a person, because the nurses are busy with
their official tasks, the doctors are not always
present and the superintendent's office seems
remote and unapproachable. I say this in all
kindness to senators who were formerly
members of the medical profession, for in my
opinion it is unfortunate that the era in
which they practised has gone. I am inclined
to think that they, as general practitioners
knew more about the human body than many
medical men of today do. It seems that
most of the medical men one meets now are
specialists. I am reminded of a man who
went to an eye specialist, who said to him:
"You have come to the wrong place. Your
trouble is with the left eye, and as J only
attend to the right eye you will have to go
to someone else."
We are living in days of specialization. The
services of the old family doctor were often
very efficient; he knew a lot about our ailments, what was wrong with us and what
we needed. Many of the old ways were splendid in their day and would be splendid even
now. In this connection, may I suggest to

now operating under a deficit of $30 million
with current shortages running to $9 million
per year. Hospital rates have jumped, for
as soon as union employees of hospitals
realized that the state was guaranteeing hospitalization costs they were quick to take
advantage of it by demanding increased
wages. As I have said in this house before,
unionization has reached such a stage that
if an electric light bulb in a hospital burns
out, only a member of a certain group is
allowed to replace it; no one else is permitted
to do that. This sort of thing has helped to
make hospitalization costs soar sky high. A
general room in a Vancouver hospital that
cost $11 per day a few years ago now costs
as much as $17.
The cost of operating the governmentsponsored health program in Great Britain
more than doubled its original estimate, and
even the Labour government had to impose
a limit on the plan's benefits. I have before
me an article describing the high cost of
social security measures in New Zealand,
a country that has boasted of the great things
it has done for its common citizens. It reads:

DECEMBER 3, 1953
drunken driving, or drivers under the influence of liquor. I have figures only for 1951.
In that year the sale in Canada of alcoholic
beverages-spirits, beer and wine-totalled
$741 million. That is a lot of money in any
man's language. It would be interesting to
know why the Dominion Bureau of Statistics
is now including in its cost of living index
the money spent on liquor. Does that mean
that alcohol has now become a necessity?
True they do not call it the cost of living
index now; although it is the same old line
of figures, it is now given out as the "Consumers' Index." If you ask them about it
they will tell you that it is no longer the cost
of living index, that it is the consumers'
index.
However, before the name was
changed they slipped in figures showing the
rise and fall in the price of liquor and other
alcoholic beverages. I should like to know
why this has been done. If it is considered
that alcoholic beverages are part of our way
of life now, I would like to have a definite
statement on the matter.
In British Columbia last year the consumption of alcoholic beverages amounted to $71
million out of which the provincial government made a profit of over $20 million. Once
a provincial government gets into this business it will never get out. Honourable senators will remember reading in their history
books of how for years Great Britain sold
opium and found it profitable, and fought a
war to keep in the opium business. The
reason given was that she could not afford
to lose the revenue derived from it. Today
governments are thinking of alcoholic beverages in the same way, and the provinces
which are in the business up to their necks,
are of course now dependent on the money
obtained from that source. I should like to
mention a serious statement made by one who
has studied this subject: that in spite of the
five-day week, more leisure and more money,
there has been more drinking, with resultant
absenteeism in industry, and that absenteeism
on Mondays is greatly on the increase.
An Hon. Senator: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I now turn to the subject of
traffic on our highways. In 1951 there were
4,253 motorists charged with driving while
under the influence of liquor. In the city of
Vancouver alone, 38 deaths have occurred
already this year. The figures I am quoting
were given to me very readily and willingly
by the R.C.M.P., and I think some of them,
at least, are well worth placing on record.
In 1942 there were 1,524,153 vehicles in the
whole of Canada; in 1951 there were 2,872,420.
In 1942, 40,885 accidents occurred on our
highways; the number in 1951 was 199,454.
83280-7

Deaths from motor accidents rose from 1,409
in 1942 to 2,686 in 1951. If honourable senators are interested in figures for the varlous
provinces, the report will be available.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Put it on the record.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If it is the wish of honourable senators, I shall place the document on
the record.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Agreed.
See appendix at end of today's report.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I just add that I am
told it is impossible to segregate the number
of deaths arising out of car accidents caused
by drunk drivers and those under the influence of liquor. It should be said that two
provinces-namely, Ontario and Quebechandle their own policing, and do not come
under the R.C.M.P.
I am sure that honourable senators who
read these startling figures will agree with
me that when the Criminal Code bill again
comes before parliament we should consider
particularly the need for making a greater
distinction between driving while intoxicated
and driving while ability to drive is impaired.
As a layman, I was rather surprised to learn
that a person who is intoxicated may not
be found to be incapable of driving a motor
car. That is most strange to me, for I know
many persons who, even when in their sober
senses-that is, when they have consumed
no alcohol at all-become wild maniacs once
they get behind a wheel. What must such
people be like when they have had a few
drinks of an alcoholic beverage?
Hon. Mr. Grant: Maybe it would improve
their driving.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It depends on what one
means by "improve". If I were to see coming
at me a car driven by a man who I knew had
had a few drinks, I would climb the nearest
pole. An incapable driverHon. Mr. Lambert: Is the proper term not
"impaired" rather than "incapable"?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you; the word is
"impaired".
I repeat, it was not until I read the Act
with some care that I learned some distinction was made between driving while drunk
and driving while ability to drive is
impaired. I may be accused of having not
spoken up when this matter was considered
in the other bouse while I was a member
there. However, I have two grounds on
which to defend myself: First, motor traffic
in those days was not so heavy as it is today
and fatal accidents were not so numerous;
and second, I am now in a place where we

SENATE
are expected to take a second look at legislation, and in this instance I am urging that
we do so.
Before closing I should like to deal with
defence expenditures. Some criticism has
been levelled at the government because of
their large expenditures for defence purposes,
but I want to compliment them upon what
they are doing in the matter of defence.
I recently read an interesting account by
a Japanese newspaperman of the experience
of a number of Japanese who had just reThe
turned from Russian slave camps.
reporter, who was educated at the University
of British Columbia, and was throughout the
war a prisoner in Russia, has now been given
the job of interviewing prisoners coming from
the slave camps. The statements of these
prisoners as to the military strength of Russia
are somewhat alarming to contemplate. Those
who would criticize the government for their
defence expenditures should think about these
things.
A prominent military man, back in 1940,
said to me, "Reid, God help us if we are ever
again caught napping." We all remember
that in 1932, when Hitler was building up
his military strength, he said he was not
preparing for war; indeed, some prominent
Americans thought that no country could
ever stand up against the Germans. In 1932
Churchill had to flee the United Kingdom for
speaking out his mind about Hitler's preparedness; the newspapers referred to him as
a warmonger, and said that while Germany
had military strength she had no desire for
conquest. I repeat what my military friend
said: If ever again we are caught napping,
we will never survive. That is particularly
true as long as a country like Russia, which
has been building up her military strength
since the Second Great War, continues to do
so. I say that this country should spend all
it can in an effort to be prepared to meet
aggression from that or any other quarter of
the world today.
I mention again the names of White and
Gouzenko, only to recall to mind that in
view of the secrets that were sold by these
dastardly spies, it is a miracle that we are
alive today. The punishment of five or ten
years' imprisonment for their flagrant violation of secrecy is utterly inadequate. And
I say that the men from Great Britain who
sold our most valued secrets should have
been disposed of in a more drastic way. Imagine a spy being given a sentence of only
five or ten years for selling his country's
secrets to Russia, which is now preparing
to conquer the world! Let us not be soft
about this thing.
I conclude with these words: We are not
spending millions of dollars today to push

back the Russians, but rather to defend civilization, and we should be prepared to spend
generously to that end.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hawkins, the debate
was adjourned.
STAFF OF THE SENATE
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH REPORTS
INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE
CONCURRED IN

OF

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the Second, Third and Fourth Reports of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. Paterson, Chairman of the Committee, moved that the reports be concurred
in.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, may
I say a few words arising out of what was
said on the presentation of these reports
yesterday?
There must have been considerable noise
here at the time, because at this end of the
chamber one could not hear what was being
presented. While some senators may not
care much whether they hear everything that
is said or not, for my part I do not apologize
for taking an interest in everything that goes
on here.
I requested that these reports be allowed
to stand until today merely for the purpose
of having an opportunity to see what was
before the house. I am not opposed to what
is being recommended by the committee.
However, I should like to leave this thought
with honourable senators-and it occurs to
me after long experience in parliamentthat we should place the responsibility for
action taken by the Internal Economy Committee in the hands of His Honour the
Speaker.
The motion was agreed to and the reports
were adopted.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR

ADDRESS IN
CONTINUED

REPLY-DEBATE

The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 3, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Jodoin for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: Honourable senators, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker,
upon your appointment to the high office
which you now occupy. Your record in this
chamber, together with your contribution to
public service, both in your native province
and in the federal field, assures this house
that your duties here will be discharged
with dignity and efficiency in the best tradition of your distinguished office.
I wish to congratulate the honourable senator from Brantford (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on
his appointment to this house. It must be
very gratifying to him after his long years of
service in the other place that his record
and work were recognized by the Prime Minister, as evidenced by selecting him as Government Leader of this chamber. Like those
who have already done so, I hasten to assure
him of my support and co-operation in the
discharge of his important duties.
I wish to congratulate and welcome the
recently appointed senators, who I am sure
will find satisfaction and happiness in this
field of endeavour and service to their native
land.
We have ail been very sorry to hear of the
accident to the genial Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), and I wish, through
the acting Leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), to
convey to the honourable senator our best
wishes for a speedy recovery and an early
return to his duties here.
I wish also to congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mrs. Jodoin) and the seconder (Hon. Mrs.

SENATE
Fergusson) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I am sure that it
will be very satisfying to the women of
Canada that two of their number should have
been honoured with this assignment, which
they discharged with great distinction, both to
themselves and to this house.
The remarks
of the seconder of the address were of particular interest to me. She dealt at great
length with the natural resources of New
Brunswick.
She recounted the industrial
development which was taking place in the
northern areas. She extolled the numerous
tourist attractions and natural grandeur of
her native province. She dealt at some length
with the development which has already
taken place there, andi her hopes for its
future. I was, however, disappointed in one
aspect of this splendid address. She omitted
the most important feature of New Brunswick's good fortune, that it enjoys the
singularly good distinction of adjoining Nova
Scotia.

and others. All these have assisted very
materially in improving our standard of
living.
The Maritime Freight Rates Act has given
a measure of relief from the disability arising
out of our geographical location; and while
we are grateful for the legislation, it in no
way compensates us for our handicap of
isolation from those markets.
Mr. Donald Gordon, President of the Canadian National Railways, speaking at the
annual dinner of the Bankers' Club of Detroit
on November 18 of this year, said that the
C.N.R. are moving the nation's products at
a level of freight rates which is among the
lowest in the world. While this came as a
surprise to me, and I am sure to many others
of the railway's clients, I still think a great
deal can be done to reduce our railways'
costs. However, it would seem to me that
even if we get a reduction in rates, to which
I believe we are entitled, the relief will in
no way compensate us for the disadvantages

would like to see some bolder steps being taken
and we would like to see a smaller time interval
between steps.
I wish to say that I am in hearty agreement with Mr. Abbott's statement. Dependent as Canada is on world trade, I believe
too that in our best interest the promotion
of freer world trade is essential to the promotion of international peace. To be a little
more specifie, I will draw your attention to
one of our commodities, namely, lumber, as
I have been engaged in every phase of its
production and marketing throughout my
adult life.
The importance of this industry to our
economie life was illustrated during the
course of an investigation held some years
ago in connection with our industrial activities. At that time it was shown that our
forest products activities consumed more
man-days of labour than coal mining; and as
you know our mines were, and are, one of
our very important sources of wealth.
Further, any decline in forest products is
more widely felt than is a like decline in any
other -activity in our province, as the industry
is more widespread generally over the whole
area.
Just at the moment production is at a very
low ebb, and pockets of unemployment are
developing, especially in the rural areas
where woodwork is complementary to farming and fishing. Our export of lumber to the
sterling areas has very largely dried up. The
main reason for this is the lack of convertibility of sterling at a rate which will
cover the cost of production, to say nothing
of showing a profit. There is still a very
substantial demand, particularly in the
United Kingdom and Ireland, for the
products of our forests, and this market at
the present time is being largely supplied
by our competitors in northern Europe who,
as you know, are in the sterling trading
area and receive much more favourable
exchange rates than we realize. There has
been a great deal of discussion in regard to
the convertibility of sterling, and what is not
generally realized is that, in spite of its
present limitations, a larger part of world
trade is conducted in sterling than in any
other currency. It embraces all members of
the commonwealth (except Canada), the
United Kingdom, the Crown colonies, the
Republic of Eire and a number of other
countries. Its sphere of importance is not
restricted to the commonwealth and the
empire. Many other countries of the free
world lie within the sterling bloc, and without some system of convertiblity this country
83280-8

must be denied the markets for the goods
which lie undeveloped in our great storehouse of natural wealth in Canada.
Our future must, therefore, depend on the
promotion of freer trade policies. If a
marked improvement cannot be shown in
the removal of present restrictions, and a
freer exchange of world currencies, it must
necessarily follow that in spite of military
alliances, in spite of peace overtures and
agreements, in spite of all the good will
which may exist among the nations of the
free world, the unity of this great bloc will
be in imminent peril. It is, of course, impossible to blame the government for the
imbalance of trade and the present inconvertibility of currency. Freer trade is a goal
which can be reached only by common consent of trading nations. Little can be accomplished by decrying the tariff policies of this
country or that. We must trade, or try to
trade, with every country whenever and
wherever possible.
Much has been said by government critics
about our trade position with the United
States, chiefly to the effect that we should
not be confining ourselves to such an extent
to one particular outlet. Much loose talk may
also be heard by those who would champion
preferential trade within the commonwealth,
to the exclusion of other countries. It would
be a calamity for our national interests if
the government of this or any other country
were forced to impose sweeping restrictions
and controls and return to a restrictionist
type of trade. Intervention with freedom of
trade, and the restoration of tariffs, might
prove the end of an economic system in
which the central feature is the freest
possible market-place.
In my opinion, the only remedy by which
to revive our trade with our overseas customers is in buying more of their goods,
thereby furnishing them with more dollars
to buy our products. And, further, until this
is accomplished I am afraid we will find it
very difficult for my province to compete in
European markets and at the same time
maintain for our workers the standard of
living enjoyed in other parts of Canada.
What I wish particularly to draw to the
attention of the Government is that we shall
be very unlikely to increase our purchases
outside Canada if we place further impediments and restrictions in the way of our
imports. Somewhere in Europe people need
Nova Scotia apples and fish, while we need
their manufactured goods; somewhere in the
free countries of Asia thousands of people
need our surplus wheat, while we need their
rubber, tea and other exports.

SENATE

Surely, surely, the wisdom and genius which
prescribed military co-operation between free
nations of the world can now meet this new
threat by suggesting a system of economic collaboration. Common consent among governments is, of course, one of the fundamental
steps toward this goal. Are the rules of international trade so rigid, so hidebound, that
to alter them by common consent would
cause the system to collapse?
Doubtless there are in each of those countries certain groups which will oppose the
change toward freer trade as vigorously as,
or even more vigorously than, they opposed
the increase of armaments. I believe, however, that these impediments can be overcome, that the spirit which welded us together
in the military field, will similarly prevail in
the economic field. I believe too that Canada,
with ber favoured economic position, her
great natural wealth, her industrial capacity,
and ber men of vision, can meet this challenge and indeed give leadership in establishing new rules of freer international trade.
I am sure that anyone who listened this
afternoon to the powerful address by the
President of the United States to the General
Assembly of the United Nations could not
help but be impressed by the urgency of the
moment and the necessity of turning from
armaments toward peaceful objectives.
In that call to all men of good will, in
whatever corner of the globe they may be,
he emphasized the utter futility of the arms
race and the need not only of diverting these
new forces toward peaceful ends but also
toward raising the standard of living in
undeveloped areas of the world.
While military strength has an important
role in maintaining the freedoms which we
have gained and cherish, it is on the economie front, and on that alone, that the future
harmony and peace of the world now depend.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, the debate
was adjourned.
ONTARIO-MANITOBA BOUNDARY
SECOND

Hon.

BILL

READING

Mr. Macdonald moved

the

second

reading of Bill B, an Act respecting the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and
Manitoba.
He said: Honourable senators, before discussing this bill, which, as the title suggests,
is to establish the boundary between Ontario
and Manitoba, you may be interested in
hearing something with respect to what has
taken place in days gone by, between these
provinces respecting the boundary.

The British North America Act, 1871, provides thatThe Parliament of Canada may from time to
time, with the consent of the legislature of any
province of the said Dominion, increase, diminish
or otherwise alter the limits of such province,
upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed
to by the said legislature . . .

During 1897 and 1898 a boundary commission, comprising one representative of the
province of Ontario and one of the Dominion
of Canada-the province of Manitoba having
declined to take part in the limitation of the
boundary-surveyed and marked on the
ground the boundary line between Ontario
and Manitoba from the north-west angle of
the Lake of the Woods to the Winnipeg river.
Officials of the Department of Justice
expressed the opinion at that time that the
boundary line could be established only by
legislation; that if the Legislatures of Ontario
and Manitoba consented the Parliament of
Canada could, by virtue of the provisions of
the British North America Act, 1871, pass
an act declaring that line to be the boundary
between the two provinces. The provinces of
Ontario and Manitoba were invited to accept
the boundary as surveyed. Ontario accepted
the invitation and passed the required provincial legislation, but Manitoba 'declined.
In 1912 the boundaries of Ontario were
extended north to the 12th base line and
then north-east to a point where the 89th
meridian intersects the shore of Hudson Bay.
Similarly, the eastern boundary of Manitoba,
which had been established from the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods to the
12th base line, was extended to the point
where the 89th meridian intersects the shore
of Hudson Bay.
In 1921 Ontario and Manitoba were
invited by the federal government to join
in the survey of the extended boundary.
Honourable senators will recall that this
extended boundary line was put into effect
but was not agreed upon by the two provinces. Manitoba again declined.
Canada
and the province of Ontario each appointed
a representative, and a survey from the
Winnipeg river to the 12th base line was
completed during 1921 and 1922 in accordance with the descriptions contained in the
Ontario-Manitoba Boundaries Extension Act.
In 1929 both provinces passed acts of consent that the boundary as surveyed and
marked on the ground from the north-west
angle of the Lake of the Woods to the 12th
Base Line, by the two commissions above
referred to, be accepted as the boundary
between the two provinces. Honourable senators will note that that line is not the whole
boundary between the two provinces. However, the Parliament of Canada did not pass
any legislation to confirm that part of the

DECEMBER 8. 1953
boundary which Manitoba and Ontario had
agreed upon. From the 12th base line to
the eastern end of Island Lake and thence
to the shores of Hudson Bay, the boundary
was later surveyed and marked on the ground
by commissions upon which the two provinces
and Canada were represented. However, up
to that time the provinces had not passed any
legislation with respect to the extended boundary line. In 1950 the federal parliament passed
legislation amending the Manitoba Boundaries Extension Act, 1912, and the Ontario
Boundaries Extension Act, 1912, to incorporate
certain changes affecting this part of the
boundary. The legislatures of the two provinces had already passed acts consenting to
the changes in that part of the boundary.
There has been considerable mining and other
activity recently along the boundary line between Ontario and Manitoba, and honourable
senators will appreciate the problems that
arise through mining claims being staked in
this area in such proximity to this boundary
that prospectors and miners cannot determine
in which of the two provinces their claims
have been staked.
Honourable senators, the purpose of the
bill before us is to establish an unalterable
boundary line between the two provinces. In
order to do this it is necessary that both the
provinces and the dominion should pass legislation to that effect. Commissioners were
appointed by Ontario and Manitoba and the
dominion to establish this line along the full
extent of the boundary between the two provinces. This line has now been completely
surveyed and marked on the ground by monuments of a permanent nature. Ontario and
Manitoba have requested that the boundary
line so surveyed and marked should now be
confirmed as the true and unalterable boundary between the two provinces, and the legislatures of these provinces have passed acts
to that effect. The bill now being presented
for second reading will, if it becomes law,
give effect to the request of the provinces of
Ontario and Manitoba.
I do not think I need say more in support
of this measure. In view of the fact that both
Manitoba and Ontario desire this legislation
I doubt whether it is necessary to refer the
bill to committee, but I shall leave that matter
in the hands of honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: If this bill is passed will
Manitoba and Ontario each have an ocean port
or the possibility of having one?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have a sketch
before me which shows that each of these
provinces has a portion of the shore on
Hudson Bay.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I am sure we all appreciate the clear
83280-Sj

explanation that the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has just given.
I am not from the province of Manitoba,
though I lived there at one time. I regret
that the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) is not here, for I am sure he would
have some interesting remarks to make about
this bill. However, there may be some
members from Manitoba who will speak on
it. In 1910 I made a canoe trip, starting
from Minaki, Ontario-it was called The
Crossing in those days-and travelling all
along this boundary line down the Winnipeg
river, into Manitoba -and beyond the English
river as far as Lac du Bonnet and the Pinawa
channel, where the Winnipeg Electric Company has its hydro plant. So I kn'ow something about the difficulties involved in
staking out that whole boundary, which runs
for hundreds and hundreds of miles. Incidentally, the Winnipeg is a mighty river and is
very wide in some places. In fact, it took
us a day or two to find where the river
flowed into the lake.
There are one or two points upon which
I should like to be i.formed, and perhaps the
Leader of the Government could give me the
information now. I should like to know
whether the boundary line runs down the
centre of the Winnipeg river or along its east
-or west bank. Also I should like to know
who owns or controls the hydro-electric sites
in that area. I recall that on our canoe trip
we passed many sites which, if developed,
would produce a great deal of electric power.
I should like to know whether these sites
are shared by the provinces of Manitoba and
Ontario, and just exactly how these matters
are settled between the two provinces.
I have nothing further to say at this time,
and while I do not know that it is necessary
to send the bill to committee I would be
prepared to attend and discuss it there.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information with respect to the line along the Winnipeg river, other than what is set forth in
ithe schedule attached to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I read that section but
found it difficult to follow. I am sure that
a surveyor could do a better job than a
lawyer.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: I agree. As a lawyer,
I should say that the boundary runs along
the centre line of the river, but I should not
like to give a definite opinion on it. As to
the question raised by my honourable friend
about the hydro sites, there is no information
before me at this time. May I emphasize,
however, that this boundary line has been
agreed upon by the two provinces, and if

SENATE
there had been any difference of opinion
between those provinces I do not think they
would have agreed as they have done.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: In other words, they
,are satisfied?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the two provinces are satisfied. And, as already pointed
out, both provinces have passed legislation
setting forth the boundary as described in
the schedule to this bill.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Mr. Speaker, I should
like this matter to go to committee, because
it affects my territory considerably. There
is much information that might be valuable,
in the light of the future of that whole
district, especially with regard to ocean
ports. If it would not be inconvenient to
the house I should like to have the bill sent
to committee, so that we may find out just
where the boundary line runs.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to either the
Committee on Transport and Communications or the Committee on Banking and Commerce. The honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has informed me that
a meeting of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce has been called for tomorrow;
but no meeting of the other committee has
yet been called. However, I leave it to
honourable senators to determine to which
committee the bill should be referred.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The Banking and Commerce committee and the Transport and
Communications committee are composed of
practically the same members, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then I move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
EXPLOSIVES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act to amend the
Explosives Act.
He said: Honourable senators may be interested in some of the background and purposes for which this legislation was originally
enacted.
This act was first introduced in the Parliament of Canada in 1911, under the Laurier
Government, but did not pass through all its
stages before the government went out of
office.

It was introduced by the Borden Government in 1914 and was passed, but proclamation of the act was delayed on account
of the war until 1920. Based on the British
act of 1875, which was also the basis for the
Explosive Acts of countries such as South
Africa, New Zealand, Belgium and others,
the purpose of the legislation was purely ta
provide a measure for public safety in order
to control the use of explosives.
The Explosives Act of 1914 continued in
operation until 1946, when it was revised
because of post-war conditions. During the
course of World War II, under the War
Measures Act, a certain number of regulations were made for obvious reasons in order
to achieve a closer control over explosives.
The post-war revisions consisted of minor
amendments to correct certain administrative changes in the department, introduction
of means of transportation not already
included in -the act, and to incorporate some
of the regulations under the War Measures
Act which it was thought advisable to retain.
During the thirty-three years in which
the act has been in force it has proved of
value as a public safeguard. Honourable
members will appreciate that in the postwar period of expansion wide-spread use
was made of various types of explosives. As
a result of this act the quality and uniformity of explosives marketed in Canada have
greatly improved. And although the use of
explosives marketed in Canada has quadrupled since the act was first passed, the
number of accidents has shown a steady
decline, owing to the control exercised by
inspectors of explosives under this legislation.
However, a number of amendments are
necessary. One of the chief amendments is
to make clear that the act is applicable to the
crown in addition to subjects of the crown
charged with the use or control of explosives.
Probably I can make that clear by saying
that people employed by a government would
come within the provisions of the amended
act. Up to the present time it has been held
that the crown was not liable under the
provisions of the act. An exception is made,
of course, in the case of explosives under the
control of the Minister of National Defence.
Other amendments include broadening of
the definition of factories to include land adjacent to the site on which the manufacture
of explosives is carried on. The terms of
licenses under the act are dealt with, as well
as certain regulatory measures for the importation and manufacture of this commodity
in such manner as not to endanger security.
An amendment to section 5, which concerns
the importation of small arms ammunition,
makes them subject to the usual restrictions.

DECEMBER 8, 1953
Some concern, however, was expressed for the
freedom of tourists from the United States
coming to this country to bring their own
hunting equipment if they were required to
obtain a permit before crossing the border.
It is now clear, however, that by regulations
under the Act, United States hunters will be
excepted from the necessity of obtaining a
permit to bring in certain prescribed quantities of small arms ammunition for these
purposes.
Further amendments deal with appeals to
the minister in the event of an unsatisfactory
directive or order by an inspector, the inspection of magazines, the authority of police
officers to make arrests under the Explosives
Act and the authority of the minister to
order the destruction of explosives which
appear to be abandoned or in a position to be
dangerous to persons or property.
The bill contains a number of clauses. I
feel sure that honourable senators will desire
further information, and it has been suggested
that the measure be referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. If it is the wish
of honourable senators, after the bill has
received second reading, I would be pleased
to move that it be referred to that committee.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with the principle of this bill I think that
we have no complaint. It is apparently a
necessary measure. On first reading it I was
wondering just how friends of mine who
come from the United States every season to
hunt big game would be able to bring their
ammunition into Canada, but the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) bas
explained that the regulations which will
be issued under subsection 1 of section 5
of the act will prevent any difficulty in that
respect.
I am a little bothered about one of the
other provisions, however. The bill amends
section 24 of the act in such a way as to
give police officers-they are called "peace
officers" in the section-power to arrest without a warrant. I think in the act as it now
stands there is some confusion as to just
what is meant by a peace officer. I believe
it was contended that he must be a federal
peace officer; but according to the new
section any peace officer-whether a provincial or a federal officer, I presume-will
be empowered to arrest without a warrant.
In general, I certainly am not in favour of
authorizing the making of arrests without a
warrant, but it seems that in a case like this
it might be necessary.
Then it seems to me that the new section
28 of the act gives too much power to the
minister. Under the present aot, powers conferred upon the minister could be delegated

by the Governor in Council to some other
authority, but the amended section would
enable the minister to delegate his authority
to anyone without any intervention by the
G'overnor in Council. I would like to have
that further explained, as well as some other
matters, and I agree with the suggestion of
the leader that it would be well to refer the
bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
wish to ask one or two questions about this
bill. Why is it that every hunter coming into
the country is able to get a licence to import
ammunition, when he can buy all the
ammunition that he needs in this country
without a licence? A person can go to any
hardware store in Canada and buy all the
bullets that he needs for his guns, twentytwo calibre or any other calibre.
An Hon. Senator: Americans cannot always
get the exact kind of ammunition they want,
though.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They may not always be
able to get just the same kind of ammunition,
but what I am concerned about is protection
for the public.
Secondly, I am a little perturbed over a proposed amendment which
would give a peace officer power to arrest
without a warrant. The amended section 25
of the act would read:
Any person employed under this act who without due authority from the minister discloses any
confidential information is guilty of an offence ...

and is liable to be arrested without a warrant.
Now, I think that is going pretty far,
because under the proposed amendment to
section 24 (2):
Any peace officer may without warrant arrest
any person whom he finds committing or whom he
on reasonable ground suspects of having committed
an offence against this act.

I also point out that one of the offences
under the act is the non-disclosure of information or the giving of false information.
Suppose an inspector came to my place,
where I have a magazine for powder-as I
have had for many long years-and asked me,
"How many cases of powder have you?" and
I said, in an off-hand way "Oh, about twentyfive". Then if be examined the magazine and
found, perhaps, fifty cases, I would be liable
to arrest by him without a warrant. I maintain that this is carrying legislation and
police power pretty far.
Until I get a better explanation in committee, I certainly will have to oppose those
two provisions.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I am not greatly concerned about the
broadening of the factory provisions of this

SENATE

act, but I am concerned about the transportation of explosives. I bring up that angle
because of the explosion which took place in
the port of Halifax thirty-six years ago-on
December 6, 1917-when some seventeen
hundred persons lost their lives through an
explosion resulting from the collision of two
ships in the harbour. I am wondering
whether there is any provision in this bill in
regard to transportation, or whether it simply
enlarges upon the definition of the place
where explosives manufacturing is carried
on. Perhaps the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) could enlighten us in
that respect.
There is another angle with which I am
concerned. As I understood the leader, the
bill would exempt the Department of National
Defence from the provisions of the act. I feel
there should be some control by the minister
over all officials handling explosives, particularly in an area such as the port of Halifax, which is quite thickly populated in the
district where the magazines are located.
Perhaps the leader could give us further
information on this point also.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The acting Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) raised the question of hunters coming into the country from the United
States. In reply I would say that under the
regulations authorized by this measure there
will be no difficulty in that respect. There is
no doubt that Americans will be permitted to
bring in ammunition for hunting.
Objections raised by the acting Leader
of the Opposition and the honourable senator
from New Westminster with respect to
power to make an arrest without a warrant
raise a very important question and also a
very difficult one. Honourable senators can
see that at times it may be very necessary
to make an arrest without a warrant. I need
not describe a circumstance in which it
would be absolutely essential that an arrest
be made forthwith. While I agree that we
might wish that the section were not necessary to the act, my feeling is that if the act
is to be enforceable the section is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Our objection is that
the power might be abused.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is true, it might
be subject to abuse; on the other hand, if
the section were not in the act many people
might run the risk of great personal danger
and destruction of property.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The power to arrest would
apply to any infraction under the act.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is correct; but,
it is hard to say for what offence an arrest
is necessary, and for what offence it is not.
I doubt if it would be possible to cover that
point with an amendment which would be
satisfactory to the house. The question, honourable senators, can of course be pursued
when the bill is considered in committee,
and indeed I hope it will be further discussed
at that time.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) asked whether
the act when amended will regulate the
transportation of explosives. My answer is
in the affirmative; in any event, the act
would regulate the importation of explosives
into the country and their storage here. I
would suggest that my honourable friend
raise the question again when the bill is
before the committee.
Honourable senators, I think I have
answered all the questions asked, and I leave
the motion for the second reading of the bill
to the consideration of the house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third

He said: Honourable senators, when Newfoundland united with Canada, in 1949, certain
cable companies which were doing business
on the island and in Canada and other countries operated the telegraph and cable lines
which connected Newfoundland with the other

the explanatory note, which reads as follows:
The purpose of this bill is to empower the

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Exceilency the GovernorGeneral's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin for an
address in reply thereto.
Han. J. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
as bas been the custorn of many senators
when rising to participate in this debate, I
wish first of ail to express my very deep
regret at the absence, through an accident,
of the honourable leader of the Conservative

that bas befallen him.

Mr. Speaker, I wisb, sir, to address a word
to you. We who served witb you wben you

are proud that you are today our Speaker.
It would be difficuit indeed for me to say
how pleased I arn by the appointrnent of the
honourabie senator frorn Brantford (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) as Leader of the Government in the Senate. The experience he gained
first as a private member of the House of
Cornrons and afterwards as Speaker of that

I shouid like to say a few words with particular respect to the honourable senator
frorn Victoria. She bas not only done a
great deal of beneficial work in a political
way, but bas devoted herseif wboiebeartedly
to the general developrnent and public good
in the province of British Columbia.
Honourabie senators, I now have to inflicit
upon you rny contribution to this debate, in
wbich one is free to discuss aimost any sub..
jeet. I have chosen to speak to you on two
subjects: First, the application of the Canadian Pacific Airlines for permission to carry
air cargo frorn, roughly speaking, Montreal
and Toronto to Vancouver, and the refusai by
the governrnent to allow tbe application; and
second, the action of the Prime Minister and
bis cabinet in setting up a new department
designed particularly to deal with not only
the probierns but also the development of
the natural resources of the northern part of
Canada.
I shahl deai later witb this second subject,
but may I now say that during the years 1

SENATE
was a member of the other house I represented Cariboo, which then extended southerly to a point just outside the city of Vancouver and northerly to the boundary of the
Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories.
In this matter of the Canadian Pacifie Airlines I am going to make two remarks which
are not, though they may appear to be,
utterly inconsistent. The first is that I was,
and am, strongly in favour of the granting
of the application of Canadian Pacifie Airlines for this all-cargo charter. Later I shall
explain why. In the second place I wish
to refute-if I may use that word without
any implication of hostility-statements
critical 'of the government's action which
have been heard from many parts of Canada;
and not only expressions of disagreementthat is another matter-but to the effect ithat
the government was interfering where it had
no warrant or authorization to intervene.
That is not the case. I do not have to tell
honourable members that, by virtue of the
Aeronautics Act-legislation passed by this
parliament-not only had the government
the right to accept or reject the application,
but the absolute responsibility of taking
action rested upon them, and there was no
way in which that responsibility could have
been avoided even had the government
desired to avoid it. It has also been said
that the cabinet rejected the recommendation of the Air Transport Board. That is not
in accordance with the facts, as set out in
the order in council passed by the government, and the report made to the Governor
in Council by the Air Transport Board, which
I am not going to take time to read.
Let me now briefiy explain why I favour
the application of Canadian Pacifie Airlines
and sincerely hope that before very long the
application will be renewed and approved
by the Governor in Council. Two things
should be remembered. First, in the order
in council this paragraph appears:
The Committee-

That is, the Governor in Council.
-note in the report of the Air Transport Board
that "the application by Canadian Pacific Airlines
would involve a major change in policy, and they
are of opinion that such a major change would
not be in the public interest at this time.

That is, the Committee, or the Governor
in Council, are of the opinion that "such a
major change wrould not be in the public
interest at this time".
The concluding part of the order in council
reads:
The Committee, therefore, advise that the Air
Transport Board be informed that the Governor in
Council is not of opinion at this time that it would

be in the public interest that the licence applied
for by Canadian Pacific Airlines to operate the
said air service be issued.

Honourable senators, I think the time will
come when the Governor in Council will feel
it is proper to grant the application. I should
now like to quote from that part of the
report of the Air Transport Board which
deals with the briefs presented to it by the
two parties involved, the Canadian Pacifie
Airlines, the applicant, and the Trans-Canada
Air Lines.
Because of the utilization which it believed it
could achieve for all-cargo aircraft on the proposed trans-continental route, C.P.A. stated that it
could provide better and cheaper all-cargo air
service to the north and northwest of this route,
that is the Yukon, Northwest Territories and
northern portions of the western provinces where
due to lack of transportation facilities and the
tremendous development which is taking place, ailcargo air service is of vital importance; and stated
that il had selected the route to Edmonton and The
Pas because of the particular need for air cargo
services in these northern areas. This need, when
linked to a scheduled all-cargo trans-continental
service, would result in fast and efficient connections between the industrial centres and the
development being undertaken in the North. Without the transcontinental cargo route not enough
utilization for large cargo aircraft could be achieved
on northern routes alone to justify any material
change in rates but if the trans-continental route
were granted C.P.A. would be able to and would
undertake to make substantial reductions in cargo
rates to the northwest.

Honourable senators, I am in complete
agreement with this part of the brief presented by the C.P.A.
I should like to pay tribute now to some
of the bush pilots who played leading roles
in the early industrial development and air
service of our northern country. Now and
then the pilots were awarded contracts to
carry mail, but these were insufficient to
cover operating costs. These men pioneered
air mail services in the far northern parts of
Alberta and the Northwest Territories as
far back as 1929. The first air mail service
in British Columbia, from Fort St. John to
Fort Nelson, began in 1936, and I shall
have something to say about this later on.
The honourable gentleman from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) is probably better informed
than any other person in this house about
the early development of the Northwest, and
he likely knows of the men I have in mind
as well as I do, even though many of them
were from my constituency. I am thinking
of the late "Wop" May who served Canada
in the first World War, and later performed
great services for Alberta and British Columbia. Then there is Don McLaren, who also
served his country with great renown in the
Air Force during the first World War. Mr.
McLaren has been with Trans-Canada Air
Lines for years and has been very helpful

DECEMBER 9, 1953
in the great work done by that company since
its inception. I am also thinking of the
service rendered to Alberta and British Columbia by "Punch" Dickens, Russ Baker,
"Ginger" Coote and by the men who operate
Associated Airways, the Mackenzie Air Services, and the Queen Charlotte Air Lines.
I should like to pay special tribute to
Grant McConachie, president of the Canadian
Pacifie Airlines, who was responsible for the
application before the Air Transport Board
for permission to operate an all-cargo air
service.
A few moments ago I spoke about the opening of an air service in 1936 between Fort
St. John and Fort Nelson, British Columbia.
I think everyone on the North American
continent now knows where Fort Nelson is,
but in 1936 only a few people, even in BritIsh Columbia, knew where it was. Fort
Nelson and surrounding airports like Watson
Lake, just across the border in the Yukon,
were brought forcibly to public attention
because of the war, but when I first advocated establishing a post office at Fort Nelson
in 1935 I had to tell the people where the
place was.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Exactly where is Fort
Nelson?
1 Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Roughly speaking, it is
situated on the route covered by the Alaska
Highway. It lies in the path of a great air
route which runs from Fort St. John, through
Fort Nelson and Watson Lake to Whitehorse,
and which is connected with Edmonton, Vancouver and Fairbanks, Alaska-only a few
miles from Siberia. As a result of the historic
meeting at Ogdensburg, New York, in August,
1940, between the late Prime Minister
Mackenzie King and the late President
Roosevelt, a Permanent Joint Board on
Defence was established. Shortly after this
the air route from Fort St. John to Whitehorse was militarized, and first-class airports
were built in the whole area. There were two
northern services operating at that time:
the Mackenzie Air Services, and the Yukon
Southern Airways, headed by Grant McConachie. The Yukon Southern Airways then
included what was the former "Ginger"
Coote's service from Vancouver to Fort St.
John. The Yukon Southern Airways covered
all that area of northern and central British
Columbia, with connections from parts of
northern Alberta and on to Edmonton. That
route was militarized by the Joint Defence
Board. With all due respect to those who
might have preferred that the Alaska Highway go down by the Mackenzie river, the
Joint Defence Board -chose the Grant
McConachie route, then called the Yukon

Southern, on to the north country. That is
why the American army shortly afterwards
decided to build the Alaska highway starting
at Fort St. John. Later on, however, the
starting point was shifted to Dawson Creek,
because it was the terminus for that portion
of the Northern Alberta Railways south of
the Peace River.
Since the C.P.A. took over the Yukon
Southern, air service has expanded, especially
in northern British Columbia, northern
Alberta and in the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories. They are now running from
Edmonton, through Prince George, into Terrace. Terrace is only a few miles from Kitimat, the place which promises to be one of
the greatest sources of aluminum production
in the world. That is one of the reasons why
I link together the development of the north
country with the granting of this application
to the Canadian Pacific Airlines. I hope the
application will be granted soon, so that the
work originally done in the north country by
Grant McConachie and other bush flyers will
be extended. Speaking personally, I would
suggest to the cabinet that from time to time
consideration be given to this application,
and as development continues-and if favourable decision should be reached-the time for
the granting of the application can be
determined.
I want to say a word in praise of the government. There is no question that they had
a legal as well as a moral responsibility to
take action, and I think they showed courage
in refusing to grant the application, because
they believed that was the proper action to
take at that time. I am sure honourable
senators will know, from what I have said,
that in urging that further consideration be
given to the application later on, there is
nothing whatever in my mind against the
Trans-Canada Air Lines. I think they have
done and are doing a great work, which could
be continued just as efficiently if this application is granted later, as if it were not granted
at all.
As I told you, honourable senators, for
some years in the House of Commons I had
the honour of representing the Cariboo country, which was the lodestone of a great deal
of that development. One of the chief necessities in that part of Canada is transportation services. I do not intend to deal at
length with this subject just now, but I do
wish to say a few words about it. Some
years ago I was chairman of the House of
Commons Committee on Reconstruction. I
am glad to take advantage of this opportunity
to express, as I have done on previous
occasions, my appreciation of the help given
to me by the honourable senator from Ottawa

SENATE
'Hon. Mr. Lambert), who presided over a
similar committee in the Senate. At that
time we recommended that agricultural,
industrial, mineral and transportation survey
be made of all the northwest country by the
federal government, the provincial governments concerned and the two great railway
systems of Canada. The purpose of the
survey was to assess the potential industrial
development of the natural resources in the
northwest country and the extension of
transportation facilities to that end. We
added a paragraph to that recommendation
to the effect that a similar survey should be
made to include all the northern country as
well as that of the northwest country.
I am very very proud of the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the cabinet, including our honourable leader in this house, for
the action they have taken in creating the
new Department of Northern Affairs and
National Resources. As the Prime Minister
has said, the resources of the far north are
the only resources left that come strictly
under the control of the federal government;
all the rest are completely under the control
of the various provinces. The Prime Minister,
with great foresight and good judgment,
created this new department, giving it a new
name, and emphasizing the fact that one of
its main responsibilities is the development
of the national resources of the northern
parts of Canada.
Honourable senators, I will not delay you
further. I just wish to express my great
pleasure in speaking of this new department,
which I think will materially increase the
development of natural resources, transport
facilities and primary production in the
northern parts of Canada.
Through the
functioning of this new department I think
the government will come to the conclusion
that the Canadian Pacific Airlines, a private
company built by the efforts of a group of
bush flyers which has grown into the large
organization that it is today, should be
granted its application for permission to
carry cargo.
Honourable senators, I thank you for your
kind attention.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri:
Honourable
senators, I wish at the outset to offer my good
wishes to our gracious Queen for a pleasant
journey and a happy return. May ber charm,
her great distinction and her good judgment
leave behind her, wherever she may go

through ber Commonwealth, through her
Empire, a memory of peace and goodwill.
God bless and protect our gracious Queen!
To you also, Mr. Speaker, I offer my good
wishes. Knowing your sound judgment and
your ability, I am convinced that while you
hold your high office we shall enjoy a period
of peace and good understanding. Let me
congratulate you on having acquired in so
short a time a French pronunciation so, shall
I say, elegant; and I am happy to tell you
that it gives us, French Canadians, a great
pleasure to hear you.
To the new Leader of this house (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) whom we have been delighted to welcome, may I offer also my good
wishes? Nature bas endowed him with great
qualities. His maiden speech proves that he
is very clever, but still more that he is a
great politician. There is a difference between
a politician and the dabbler in politics.
We from Quebec are proud to number him
as one of us since he came to our university
to learn our language, which he speaks so
charmingly. I must also say how much I
regret the absence of the Leader of the
Opposition in this house, the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), and I
ask the acting Leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), to
offer him my best wishes for a complete
recovery. As for you, Mr. Acting Leader,
I have no doubt that you will consider the
legislation submitted to this house with the
same objectivity as your chief, who has
shown such good judgment and so much
ability.
At the opening of this session we found
that the number of senators had increased by
a dozen or so. I am convinced that all the
newcomers will be a credit to the Senate,
because, in reading their biographies, one
realizes that the Prime Minister of Canada
knew well how to choose his senators.
Their ability and, the enlightenment they
will bring us will help to solve more readily
the problems that are going to be submitted
to us. Their advice will be useful to us; nay,
it will be necessary.
But let me point out in particular the coming into this chamber of three new lady senators, which brings to five their number in the
Senate. Following the example of their two
predecessors, they can, especially in dealing
with questions related to social measures, not
only be a support, but also a source of light
of immense value. They have only to follow
in the footsteps of both honourable ladies who
came before them to this house. Who could
be surprised at the appointment of ladies to
the Senate? Do they not represent about
50 per cent of the voters? Indeed they

DECEMBER 9, 1953
represent a larger proportion. We talk a great
deal about social security, social laws; but
what would be the use of all those social
measures if the family were not their corner
stone? Is not the nation composed of every
family in the country? And who ensures
family security, the great family security if
it is not our women, the mothers of our
families? The worth of a nation depends
directly on the worth of its families. We can
pass all possible measures, but if at the base
there is no family security our nation will
never grow or prosper or develop healthily.
The ladies in the Senate are therefore here
to represent the family, the basic unit of our
nation. It is in the midst of his family, in
his home, that a man learns to love, and sometimes to hate. It all depends on his mother.
The lady who moved the address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin)
referred to the Biblical statement that it is
not good for men to live alone, and she added,
"even in the Senate". I should say that this
statement is and will always be true. It is
not good for man to live alone, because man
is not a good educator in the proper sense
of the word. Education first starts in the
heart, and it is the mother who gives this
education, this training, to her children.
That is the reason why, in our times, when
there is so much talk about social security,

family allowances, old age pensions, etc., we
need to receive advice from those persons
who can make or destroy the home
Someone said that woman carries peace or
war in the folds of her skirts. It is true, for
it is she who, when raising her children,
instils into them that spirit of dedication,
of charity and of love which can make the
world better. A heartless woman-a rare
occurrence, fortunately-cannot but sow
hatred, and if such progapanda spreads too
much it could cause the destruction of mankind. A heartless man is like one of the
beasts deprived of reason which live in the
jungle, detest one another and devour one
another; the law of the survival of the fittest
prevails instead of the golden rule. Glory
then be to womankind, especially to the
women of this country. By paying this
tribute to you, ladies, I pay tribute to all
our Canadian Mothers, to whom we are
indebted for the development of this country,
its blossoming, its grandeur.
I would be remiss in my duty if I failed
to add a word of regret for our dear
departed. I do not wish to make a eulogy of
each one, as those who have spoken before
me have paid them tribute much better than
I could. However, I should like to mention
one of them; at the last session, he worked

with great zeal on the special committee
appointed to inquire into salacious and
indecent literature in Canada. I mean the
senator for St. Boniface, the late Senator
Davis. The best memorial that we could
erect to his memory would be to pursue his
work. His predecessor, the late Senator
Doone, had cleared the ground. Senator Davis
had, so to say, consolidated the work which
had already been begun and which must be
carried on. In the course of their investigations, social workers find out that too many
of our youth are just drifting. From a very
tender age, our children's heads are crammed
with a lot of unhealthy literature. I am not
talking only of salacious literature, but also
of all those comics which deal only with
murders, gangsters and crimes, a literature
which displays the most skilful ways to
cheat the law, to dispossess someone without
being caught. If at the end of those stories
guilty individuals are arrested, the imagination of young children, of teen-agers, tries to
go further and seek how those guilty individuals could have better succeeded in
escaping the hand of justice. That plays more
havoc than you could imagine. Would it not
be possible to find organizations which, to
satisfy the imagination of children, could
publish stories and illustrations worthy of
their attention and apt to develop the best
resources of their minds? Instead of causing
their imaginations to work on unhealthy,
destructive and negative schemes, let us guide
young people toward good, so that they may
elevate their minds, ennoble their hearts,
develop that creative and saving virtue of
love, of charity, that spirit of mutual help
with which we must dedicate ourselves to
was
spirit which
that
another,
one
bequeathed to us by Christ, two thousand
years ago, when He told us: "Thou shalt love
one another" and not "Thou shalt detest one
another".
Now, this important committee, which
was formerly under the chairmanship of both
our lamented colleagues, should not fall into
oblivion, but instead somebody in this house
should take over and revive it. May I be
allowed a suggestion? Could not one of our
lady senators take charge today of this
committee, set it up again and try to find a
remedy for the pollution of our youth's minds
and hearts through pernicious literature? If
a lady senator would consent to assume such
responsibility she would get the support of
the senators at large, who would do their
best to obtain concrete results. Their suggestion should not be negative; it is not sufficient to say "Don't do this, don't do that".
Something constructive should be put forward. We should be told how to uproot this
threat and how to fight evil with good.

SENATE
The Speech from the Throne mentioned
the housing problem and announced the
introduction of a measure to help the disabled.
Please allow me to say a few words on both
these problems.
I just spoke of moral education within the
family. In order that a family may live in a
suitable atmosphere, may live a truly family
life, and in order that communism may not
take hold among us, one of the best means to
adopt is to increase the number of home
owners who are heads of families. Being the
owner of his house, a man is also the owner
of that part of ground on which it stands,
and, therefore, owner of a part of his country.
He is on a bit of ground which belongs
exclusively to him and his family lives happily there. "Chez nous" is one expression
that can hardly be translated into English.
The phrase "at home" has not the same
meaning. "Chez nous" comprises more than
the place where we live. These words include
also the family, the roof under which we live,
that bit of our land which is our personal
property. This phrase includes everything:
family life, economic and even spiritual life.
In multiplying these "homes" throughout our
country, we multiply homes where people
are more attached to their native land and
love it more. By so doing we multiply also
homes where it feels better to live. This is
also one of the cornerstones of social and
moral security. One does not worry about
tomorrow, does not wonder if in a few
weeks tine one will be forced to move for
lack of space; one is at home, one lives in
ane's own house. Children who will soon
leave their parents' homes to establish their
own homes will say to themselves: "At home
things were done this or that way and today
in my own home we will continue to live the
way we were taught."
I take pleasure in bringing to the attention of this house, the splendid work achieved
by the Credit Unions of the province of Quebec with regard to the housing problem. More
than $115 million has been loaned by the
credit unions to their shareholders for housing purposes; this money is repaid by monthly
and sometimes weekly instalments.
In the large cities it is the corporations and
the insurance companies which make loans,
but in the small cities and in the rural areas
these companies are not interested in loaning
money. Consequently, it is the credit unions
which help the people of small means in the
small industrial and rural communities. I
cannot resist the pleasure of underlining the
splendid work achieved in this field by some
housing co-operative societies of the Three

Rivers district, in the province of Quebec. I
especially wish to give full credit for this
work to the president of the Fédération des
Caisses Populaires Desjardins, Mr. Laurent
Letourneau, who, in that district, has been
one of the most active promoters of the activities of the housing co-operatives.
To what extent will the legislation which
will be drafted help in the building of houses
and homes? I still do not know; but, having
confidence in the wisdom and in the judgment
of our Prime Minister, I am sure that the new
act will be even more humane, so to say,
than the previous acts, which have nevertheless achieved much good.
A social law, as humane as possible, will
help the unfortunate, those who possess no
worldly goods, the crippled, the paralytics
who do not have anything and who are
always worrying about tomorrow; and I hope
that all the provinces will take advantage of
that law. No barriers should remain between
the provinces when the welfare of our people
is at stake. One cannot invoke autonomy
when it comes to helping the needy. If I
mention that law especially, it is because for
many years, in my own small community, I
have been handling special cases together
with the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the
Family Service, the association for helping
needy mothers, the association for handicapped people, etc. Up to now, the problem of
helping disabled persons bas been difficult
to solve because these people cannot earn
anything and their morale is very low;
it is difficult to build it up. If we were
living in some other countries, perhaps
we would say: "These people are of no
use. Let us make away with them." But
who knows? One day, they may recover,
and those who today are outcasts may develop
into geniuses who will achieve more for mankind than the wealthy people who have not
even the time to think. A few months ago,
someone said to me: "I like our Prime Minister, he is so human." This legislation is
further evidence of his kindness.
A typical case occurred some months ago
where I come from, at the association for
handicapped persons. Here was a man who
for twelve years had been lying on his chair,
utterly helpless. His attendant would place
him on his chair in the morning, and would
put him to bed at night; he had to be fed.
Through a miracle he got in touch with us,
and through a second miracle he received
treatments from Dr. Dugal, who is performing
near-miracles in his magnificent clinic. Today,
after eight months, this man may not walk
as well as we do, but he does walk and can
use his hands. In the heart of that disabled

DECEMBER 9, 1953
man, hope and life are flowing anew. And,
that handicapped man is not an imbecile;
maybe something extraordinary will come
from him, because he had a lot of time to
think and meditate, and because he had
always faith in God.
We sometimes hear laudatory remarks
about the Senate, but more often disparaging
ones. It is claimed, for instance, that the
Senate does nothing, is of no use, that senators are asleep, and what else!
The Senate was organized as it is today
for the safeguard of all Canadian citizens,
and more especially for the protection of
minorities, that is to say, for the scrutiny
of legislation.
There is a fact which is unknown or which
is ignored: in this chamber, when legislation
has been introduced, and once three, four
or five objective speeches have been
delivered on the bill, it is useless, we believe,
to waste the time of this chamber in idle
and sterile discussions. Such legislation is
then referred to committees, where a great
work is performed. For some years, as
everyone knows, the great majority of
non-contentious pieces of legislation have
been first considered and then passed by the
Senate; this means that the Senate committees perform quite arduous work during the
whole session. To cite but a few instances,
let us take the legislation which revamped
the Bankruptcy Act and was delved into by
a Senate committee during three sessions,
if I remember correctly; it comprises hundreds of pages and is quite hard to study.
There was also an act consolidating the
army, air force and navy acts, considered by
the Senate committee before being referred
to the Commons. The Criminal Code was
also considered by the Senate committee for
months and months before being deferred to
the other place. Those bills having been
gone into without political passion, in an
objective way, the members have then less
work to do.
In my opinion, those are quite important
things. When at the end of the war the
Foreign Exchange Control Act was introduced, prorogation was delayed about ten days,
because the Senate committee sat in the
morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening.
If I am not mistaken, 70 amendments were
made to that bill.
What did the Senate do? People do not
realize the work we perform, and the reason
is that today they figure that any achievement calls for much noise in the limelight.
However, I never felt that noise could do
any good, but I often noticed that some good

was done without noise. To accomplish something, we do not have to destroy but to

which is often part of our work. When you
have not had to suffer from something, you
do not enjoy the happiness of not having to

(Text):
Honourable senators, I would like to say
a few words about the wheat problem, which
was dealt with by our colleague the acting
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
I do not claim that I can solve the problem;
but certain facts are evident, and I believe
that political economists could solve it.
During the past two or three years
Canada's grain crop has been above normal;
there is a surplus, and the government has
been held responsible for the lack of storage
facilities for all this grain. Some two years
ago, when the crop was heavy, there came
an early snowfall, and the farmers did not
have sufficient time to thresh and store all
their grain. If my memory serves me correctly, the government advanced to the
farmers $165 million on that grain. The following spring, after the snow had melted,
the grain that was outdoors was found to be
well preserved and the farmers sold it. Why
should the same situation not recur this year?
Nature's great warehouse is the least costly
and sometimes the best. This, however, is not
the point which I wish to stress today.
A few days ago the Food and Agriculture
Organization issued a memorandum warning
us that the western world must solve the
food crisis, that otherwise we shall be faced
with a revolution by the hungry populations
of the east, which increase by a hundred
million every four years. In Canada, we do
not know what to do with our surplus wheat;
in eastern countries, hundreds of millions of
people are underfed.
I recall that at the first conference of the
F.A.O., at Hot Springs, we discussed for a
whole week the world food problem and the
paradoxical and illogical position of certain
countries which destroy surplus food while
people in other countries are starving. After
eight days of debate, this sad state of affairs
was blamed upon a faulty system of distribution. This happened in 1942, eleven years
ago. What steps have we taken since then
to solve the problem of food distribution?

Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I hope that our government, usually so wise and judicious, will
do everything possible to assure the protection of the dairy industry, so vital to the
agricultural class. If tomorrow the government abandoned the policy of supporting the
price of butter, farmers would have to rid
themselves of their cattle, and the grain crisis
would be more acute than it is, for the consumption of grain would be considerably
decreased. We must bear in mind that farm
animals, especially dairy cattle, are great consumers of grain. I have said before, and
I say again, that for our country the dairy
industry is vital economically; that our
farmers who are butter producers contribute
to the prosperity and stability of the whole

Canadian economy, whereas the importation
of vegetable oils contributes to its destruction.
I conclude these remarks by asking the
powers that be to try to find a just and fair
solution of this problem. We shall arrive
at such a solution if we base our economy
on the fundamental Christian principles
which we hold in common. Our Governor
General, speaking on November 5 at the
annual dinner of the Council of Christian
Social Order, stated the following fundamental truth:
On the one hand we seem to own, to an unbelievable extent, power and wealth, together with
scientific knowledge and freedom; on the other, we
see, at least among other nations, that the masses
dwell in ignorance, servitude and pauperism and
that there exists a state of poverty and cruelty
which we do not dare look at, even in imagination.
-It seems that we have now lost sight of the divine
We are facing a
Being and the divine design.
terrible and terrifying machine which no one can
control any longer.

And His Excellency drew the following
conclusions:
The Church must face a world which is enslaved
not only by its passions, but also by its scientific
knowledge. I believe that its representatives could
associate more profitably with the large number of
enlightened laymen who attempt to find a solution.
Together, they could oppose, with intellectual as
well as spiritual weapons, the anarchy of pagan
barbarity. I am firmly convinced that the heart of
all our problems rests in our own hearts. It is
clear that we should neglect no means in attacking
this citadel.

Honourable senators, I shall conclude my
remarks by asserting that, if we wish to find
a solution to our economic problems, we
should not consider the mere cult of the
dollar sign; we should take into consideration the spiritual and moral values which
alone can guide the world and improve its
future.
With this principle in mind, and with the
trust I rest in my country and my compatriots, I believe that a new spirit is spreading over Canada and that our country will
lead the way for other nations, for the basis
of our economy will rest upon moral values.
Hoping that this will materialize, I repeat
the following words of one of our great
poets:
O Canada, mon pays, mes amours.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar, the debate
was adjourned.
ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second reading of Bill 5, an Act respecting the
use of election material for by-elections and
Northwest Territories elections.

He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
despite its title, is really a non-controversial
one. Its main purpose is to effect an economy.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am sure that will
bring great joy to the heart of the Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Finance (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and to his loyal and interested
followers.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is something new, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: This bill marks the
glorious advent of a young minister in the
government, whose maiden effort in the other
house was to provide for the saving of money
to the people of Canada. This opportunity
came about in a natural way in connection
with the preparation of material under the
Canada Elections Act. As honourable senators know, the Canada Elections Act of 1938
was revised early this year and a new law
came into effect in September. As the existing stocks of election material were prepared
pursuant to the Canada Elections Act of
1938, it would be illegal to use them in any
by-election or in elections in the Northwest
Territories. The purpose of this bill, as
outlined in section 2, is to authorize the
use of this material in such elections. This
will, of course, avoid the expense of printing
new election material.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would the honourable
gentleman inform the house how much money
will be saved?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I was just waiting for
my inquisitive friend to ask that question.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I was going to ask the
same question myself.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I was informed this
morning by Mr. Castonguay, the Chief Electoral Officer, that approximately $500,000
was spent in printing material preparatory to
the last general election. It is his opinion
that the adoption of this legislation will save
the country from $20,000 to $25,000 in the
forms and instruction used for by-elections
and for elections in the Northwest Territories.
Honourable senators, the explanatory note
to this bill is quite clear and I do not think
there is anything more I need say.
As the
bill does not contain anything contentious,
perhaps it need not be referred to committee.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I am in favour of any legislation that will
result in saving money and thereby cutting
down, even to a slight degree, the amount of
taxes we have to pay. I hope that this will
establish a worthy precedent which will be
followed throughout the session in other
legislation.

SENATE
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has explained the bill fully. I
am sure we all realize that it would be quite
an expense to print new election material to
be used in any by-elections and Northwest
Territories elections from now until the next
general election. Such forms might be used
for only one or two by-elections and the
rest would be wasted. There is no doubt
that the Canada Elections Act will be revised
again before the holding of another general
election. As a matter of fact, I understand
that a committee has been set up in the
other house to deal with the whole electoral
procedure. I am completely in favour of
the bill and I see no reason why it should
be sent to committee. It is a simple measure.
As I said before, I hope that its economy
feature will serve as an example to be followed in all other legislation that comes to
us this session.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
our colleague from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) was kind enough to suggest that
this measure would be one to 'rejoice my
heart. I was raised in a rather strict Presbyterian household, and one of the admonitions
laid upon us was that we should always be
thankful for small mercies.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I therefore welcome this
bill, for it will result in a saving to our
taxpayers. True, it will only throw a tiny
pinpoint of light on the great gloom of public
spending that oppresses this whole country
today at all levels of government. However,
the bill has my hearty support. It is a simple
measure providing, as the honourable senator
from Ottawa has explained, for the use of
election material at present on hand in
by-elections and Northwest Territories elections. I am sure that ample quantities of
the material for these purposes are available
in the electoral offices of this country. Of
course, it is important to have this material
available in the Northwest Territories,
because our Eskimo friends-or citizens, shall
I say-now have the franchise. An Eskimo,
emerging from his igloo would of course be
delighted to receive some literature or documents informing him of the manner in which
elections are conducted in Canada. Even if
he did not learn very much about the subject, he would have the material, anyway.
Honourable senators, I repeat that I support this bill whole-heartedly.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I wish
to say something that I hope can be drawn
to the attention of the proper authorities,
although it is not directly concerned with the

bill before the house today. In the last federal
election one candidate's name was so long
that no room was left for the voter to put
an "X". When the returns were counted
many ballots were discarded, because some
voters who could not find a place to mark
an "X" next to the candidate's name put the
"X" in the margin, and that portion of the
ballot was torn off by the returning officer.
Others marked the ballot paper in different
places. I think the authorities should take
steps to see that that cannot occur again. Up
to the present time in British Columbia we
have had a system of voting in by-elections
whereby the candidates are numbered, one,
two, three, four, etc., on the ballot paper.
Some voters accustomed to that system
marked the numeral "1" and an "X" on the
ballot papers opposite the name of the candidate of their choice. Those ballot papers
were thrown out. I think many old customs
should be reviewed in the light of modern
conditions. If a voter puts the numeral "1"
and an "X" after a candidate's name, surely
it is obvious that he intends to vote for that
candidate? I felt this matter should be drawn
to the attention of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Are you referring to
provincial elections?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No; I am referring to the
last federal election. In part of the constituency that I had to do with I think 65
ballots were discarded: some were marked
in the wrong place, and others were not
marked at all because there was not sufficient
space.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: What was the name
of the candidate?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I cannot disclose the name
of 'the candidate; I would not do so. Naturally, I would not be supporting other than
a Liberal candidate, and it is on his behalf
only that I speak, because he lost by a margin of 35 votes. As I have said, many ballots
were thrown out on the simple technicality
of having a "1" and an "X" marked on them.
Some ballots bore no marking at all, because
there was not enough room on them and
the voter was obliged to put his mark in the
margin, which the returning officer tore off.
I commend the government highly for this
measure. I think this is a red-letter day in
the history of legislation. The bill is to my
knowledge the first one which has proposed
economy of election material by a government department. At the same time, I wish
to say that I cannot understand why city
residents are treated differently from rural
people in the matter of being furnished with
information on where to vote. In cities
every elector is sent a copy of the voiters' list

DECEMBER 9, 1953
in his district and is also informed where
he may vote. People in the country receive
no such information at all. That might not
be a serious omission in settled rural districts, but in British Columbia, owing to the
growth of population and industry, hardship
is caused when people do not know where
to vote.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Are those lists supplied
by the government or by the party?
Hon. Mr. Reid: By the government. The
returning officer sends a list to all voters
in the city. In the city from which I come,
where the population is dense, the lists are
posted up, and at the top of each list the
location of the polling booth is stated.
An Hon. Senator: Where are the lists
posted?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On telegraph poles. Also
the lists are sent directly to the city voter.
So he has ample opportunity to see whether
his name is correctly given on the list, and
where he has to go to vote. But, as I say,
people in the country are not treated in this
way. This is unfair to them, for all should
be treated alike.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
with reference to what has just been said by
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), may I point 'out that
in the other place the minister proposed that
a committee be set up next year to deal with
this general subject. I shall certainly see
that the points raised by my honourable
friend are brought to the minister's attention.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Next sitting.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 9, an Act respecting the
National
of auditors for
appointment
Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, the provisions
of this bill are so clearly explained in the bill
itself that no explanatory note was considered
necessary. The bill provides for the appointment of George A. Touche & Company, of the
cities of Toronto and Montreal, chartered
accountants, as auditors of the Canadian
National Railways as defined in the act. A
sinilar bill is presented each year. Under

the provisions of the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act it is necessary to have
auditors appointed annually, and they report
annually.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are they also the auditors
of the accounts of the Canadian National
Steamships?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; the Act covers
that.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I have a few remarks to make in connection
with this bill. A similar bill has been presented to this chamber about this time every
year; except, I think, in the year 1935 when
this firm of auditors was not reappointed.
I have often wondered why it was necessary
to have outside auditors appointed when so
many good auditors are paid officiais of the
Auditor General's department. I remember
that in 1947 the present Minister of Fisheries,
speaking in the other place, went very fully
into this very matter and ended up by advocating that the Auditor General audit the
Canadian National Railways' accounts. That
would make it unnecessary to appoint any
outside auditors at all, and I think that under
the provisions of the act, which was mentioned by the leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
this policy could be adopted.
Can the leader give us any information as
to what this audit by George A. Touche and
Company costs the railway, or the people of
Canada? The fee for the audit amounts no
doubt to a very considerable sum, and when
the railway runs at a deficit, as it frequently
does, that money must be paid out of the
pockets of the people.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it would be
possible to have the audit made by the Auditor General, although an amendment to the
Act might first be necessary. However, the
audit would still be quite an expensive
procedure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: More expensive.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably more expensive than if an outside firm did it. The
staff of the Auditor General's Department
would have to be greatly increased, and I
think the cost would be considerably higher
than a private firm's fee.
There is a question as to whether the audit
should be done by a government department.
In my opinion, it is better to have the
accounts of a government-owned corporation
like this audited by an outside firm.
Now, with respect to the cost: the fee this
year is to be $75,000. That seems a lot of
money, but the task is a very big one. I
might give a history of the fee that has been

SENATE
paid over the years. Prior to 1938 the fee
paid to George A. Touche and Company was
$50,000 a year, but in that year it was
increased to $51,800 because the company
was required to audit also the accounts of
Trans-Canada Air Lines and the Canadian
National Railways' Securities Trust. In 1946,
the annual fee was increased to $55,000,
principally owing to the increased work
imposed upon the auditors as a result of the
substantial growth of Trans-Canada Air
Lines. Some four years later, in view of
the large increase in salaries and professional
fees, and the addi'tional work arising out of
the expansion of Trans-Canada Air Lines,
together with the increased railway operating
revenues and expenses, the fee was increased
to $65,000 per annum, effective July 1, 1950.
As a result of representations made by
George A. Touche and Company, and upon
the recommendation of the presidents of
Canadian National Railways and TransCanada Air Lines, the fee was increased to
$75,000 per annum from January 1, 1953, by
authority of Order in Council P.C. 1953-1370,
dated September 9, 1953. The representations made by the auditors were that their
salaries and overhead expenses have continued to increase; that since 1949 the
operating revenues of the C.N.R. and T.C.A.
have risen 34-8 and 49-8 per cent, respectively; and that these factors, and the additional work arising fron
the recent
recapitalization
legislation, have greatly
increased the time required to perform the
audit.
As I say, honourable senators, ithe fee
seems large, but when we consider the work
involved in auditing the accounts which are
included under the heading of the Canadian
National Railways I think we realize that
the expense is reasonable, in relation to the
work which must be performed.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Just to make sure that
I understand the leader correctly, I would
ask if he stated that the Canadian National
Steamships were included in the original
contract. If so, I would point out that while
there has been an increase in volume of
receipts and expenses so far as the Canadian
National Railways and the Trans-Canada Air
Lines are concerned, there has been a very
decided decrease in the business done by the
Canadian National Steamships, both in
receipts and also in the number of ships
operating. So, I would think that instead
of an increase of $10,000 in the fee there
should perhaps be a decrease. I would also
suggest that the increase in volume of receipts
and expenses does not add greatly to the
auditors' work: there are practically the same

number of items, only the figures are larger.
I doubt very much if that is a good reason
for an increase of $10,000 in compensation.
I am in accord with the thought expressed
by the acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), that consideration should be
given to having the audit carried out by the
Auditor General and his efficient staff. True,
there has been occasional criticism of Mr.
Watson Sellar, but we all know that he is an
efficient auditor and has a very fine staff.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I quite agree with
the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) that the Auditor
General is himself a capable auditor and has
an efficient staff, but for him to take on the
National Railways' audit would require a
very large addition to his present staff.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: However, the question of whether it is advisable to have this
work done by the Auditor General can be
considered in the future.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth asked me whether I was sure that
the Canadian National Steamships' books
were audited by the company which audits
the National Railways. My information comes
from the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), who suggested
that an audit of the steamship lines was
included. As I never knew the honourable
sena.tor to be wrong in his remarks in the
other house, and never yet in this house, I am
accepting his word for that statement.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting -of the
bouse.
PIPE LINES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. D. Euler moved the second reading
of Bill 10, an Act to amend the Pipe Lines
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is a
simple one. Its purpose is to correct uncertainties in, and perhaps omissions from, the
Pipe Lines Act passed by parliament in 1949.
Members of the house know that supervision and administration of that act is
placed in the hands of the Board of Transport Commissioners; and it was expected
when the act was passed that any company
desiring to build a pipe line for the transportation of oil or gas would of necessity
make application to parliament for a private
act granting a charter. In that way the company would come under the jurisdiction of

DECEMBER 9, 1953
the Board of Transport Commissioners. It
seems, however, that a flaw has been discovered in the law, and it may be possible
under certain circumstances for a company
to build a pipe line without applying to
parliament for its charter, and thus not come
under the jurisdiction of the board.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Have some companies
mot already built lines without applying to
parliament for a charter?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not sure that there
are actually in operation any companies
which have not a charter granted by parliament. My friend may possibly have in mind
pipe lines built entirely within a province,
which do not come under the jurisdiction of
the transport commissioners and are not in
issue in this legislation.
I am sure the house will agree that any
companies building inter-provincial pipe lines
should, like railway companies, apply to
parliament for a charter, and that their
operations should be under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Transport Commissioners.
While I do not think it is of particular
interest to members of the Senate, nor that
it should influence their consideration of this
question, the fact is that the bill has already
been passed by the other house. In the short
debate that took place there, the bill received
the full approval of members of all parties
represented in that chamber.
The bill, as I have said, is a simple one.
I leave it to honourable senators to indicate
whether it should be referred to a committee
for further consideration.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
my remarks on this bill will be brief. While
I agree with what the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has said, I
notice that the bill was amended substantially in Committee of the Whole in the other
house. It is now made quite clear that the
provisions of the act are to cover interprovincial pipe lines. The proposed new
section 10A reads:
No person, other than a person having authority
under a Special Act to construct or operate pipe
lines for the transportation of oil or gas, shall construet or operate an extra-provincial pipe line, but
nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
or prevent any person from operating or improving
an extra-provincial pipe line constructed before the
lst day of October, 1953.

There was some discussion in the other
place as to the meaning of the word "irmproving", and it was pointed out that it did not
mean "extending"; in other words, a company operating a provincial line could not
extend its operation into another province
or another country.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I think it was made perfectly clear that the procedure prescribed
applies to interprovincial pipe lines.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And more particularly
with regard to a line that may be constructed
across the international boundary, which of
course means into the United States.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask a question of the mover
for second reading. In reading the debates
of the other place, my attention was drawn
to a rather surprising statement by the minister, which perhaps I may be permitted to
read. He used these words:
When the Pipe Lines Act was passed in 1949, it
was considered that, in order to have the benefits
of the act, including the power of expropriation-

My question is, have pipe line companies
authority under the Act to expropriate property to the same extent that the crown or a
railway company has such power? When
the pipe line came into British Columbia, the
company came to an agreement with all
land owners affected by the construction
project. It seems to me that to give such
companies the right to expropriate property
is going a little too far.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think it is absolutely
necessary that a pipe line company be given
the right to expropriate property. For
example, it would be ridiculous to grant a
charter to build a railway from one point
to another and not allow the right of expropriation of land over which the line would
pass.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The Trans-Mountain pipe
line was built without expropriation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But that was only through
the mountains.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No; I disagree with that
statement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If everybody would
agree on the price to be paid for the land,
there need be no trouble over expropriating it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I still think it is giving
the pipe line companies a lot of power.
Although they will be making a good profit
out of the transportation of oil and gas,
I am quite sure that the consumer will be
asked to pay the regular price for his fuel.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But how could a pipe line
company, or a railway company, undertake
to build a line if it did not have power to
expropriate land, upon the payment of fair
compensation? It just could not be done.

SENATE

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Refer it to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I suggest, with deference
to the leader, that, if the bill is satisfactory
to all senators it might be well to give it
third reading today, and I would so move.
Hon. Mr. Reid:

Hon. Mr. Aselfine:

The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), seconded by the honourable senator

from Brantford (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), that
this bill be now read the third time.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There seem to be
some honourable members who object to third
reading today, and I do not think it would
be proper for me to try to rush it through
the house at the present time. The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
will, I think, agree with me that there is no
parti.cular urgency, and that the bill may be
allowed to stand for third reading until
tomorrow.

DEPORTATION ORDER
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I should like to refer to a dispatch
appearing in the Toronto Globe and Mail,
under the heading:
Girl Seaman Fools Crew and Captain.
This seems to be a very unfortunate
instance. According to the story an immigration board of inquiry ordered deportation of
the girl in question. Here, surely, was an
opportunity for Canada to secure an unusually
good new citizen. The dispatch says that
the girl, who is only eighteen years of age,
was handy with her fists, and that the captain of the ship on which she came to Canada
as a seaman described her as one of the best
helmsmen he ever had. I understand that
she threatened to jump overboard and swim
ashore while the ship on which she was being
deported was going down the St. Lawrence,
and that in order to prevent her doing so
she was locked in a roorn until the ship
arrived on the open ocean. I am sure we all
admire a struggle on the part of anyone to
achieve a worth-while purpose. A determined effort was made by this girl to secure

admittance to Canada, but she was refused.
In view of the circumstances, I for one would
be perfectly willing to pay her passage over
here; and if the reply to that is that it would
be against the law, against passport regulations and so on, I would say that this is
truly a case where the law is an ass.

EXPLOSIVES BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-AMENDMENTS
CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill C,
and Act to amend the Explosives Act.
Hon. Elie Beauregard: Honourable senators,
I move that these amendments be concurred
in now.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
before the amendments are concurred in,
perhaps either the acting chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) or the
leader of the house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
would make a statement as to their effect.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: Honourable senators,
I appreciate the reason for the anxiety
expressed yesterday by the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
as to the effect of these amendments. No
doubt he has in mind a catastrophe that
occurred in Halifax many years ago.
As honourable senators will note, the purpose of the bill is to tighten the control on

SENATE
all persons having to do with the production,
transportation or storage of explosives, or
handling of explosives in any way. The bill
would make the crown subject to provisions
of the Explosives Act, a condition that did not
exist previously.
What we accomplished in the committee
was briefly this: we clarified the clause making the crown subject to the provisions of the
legislation and also to the regulations which
will later be made by the Governor in Council. There is, however, an exception to the
obligations of the crown, in that the act does
not apply to the Department of National
Defence. My understanding is that it would
be hard to supervise the handling of explosives in the possession of officials of the
For instance, explosives for
department.
defence purposes might come into Halifax
by a ship of the merchant marine, or by a
naval ship, or by rail. The Minister of Mines
and Technical Surveys is responsible for the
administration of the act, and all departments, with the exception of National
Defence, should be subject to that administration. It has been said that explosives coming
by railroad, for instance, would be under the
control of the Transport Commission. No
such provision is made in this bill.
My suggestion is that we pass the bill in
its present form, and that the honourable
senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor) put in writing, in the form of an
inquiry, all that he has in mind by way of
suggestions: for example, with regard to the
Transport Commission, and with regard to
departments other than National Defence
that may have something to do with explosives. As the bill stands, the only department
to which the act does not apply is National
Defence. I agree that each and all of the
departments have the right to insist on suitable regulations covering anything they have
to do in this connection. However, I am not
a member of the government; I have no
responsibility other than my limited responsibility as acting Chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee. So, I repeat, all I can
suggest to the honourable senator is that he
put in writing, in the form of an inquiry,
whatever he wishes to suggest to the government; and if it is deemed advisable to adopt
his suggestions he may get a response in the
form of an amendment.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would like to thank the
acting Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce (Hon. Mr. Beauregard)
for his explanation and suggestion. Let me
make it clear that I have no objection to the
principle of the bill. My aim rather is to
safeguard the port of Halifax from the

recurrence of certain events such as have
happened there in the past; and it is
because of our experiences resulting from
those events that I have brought this
matter to the attention of honourable senators. I hope that I have thereby served a
good purpose. It may be that the departments concerned in the handling of explosives-namely, Defence, Transport, and Mines
and Technical Surveys-will avail themselves of the discussion which has taken
place here and, if possible, make regulations to safeguard the entry of ships, whether
common carriers or naval ships, bringing
ammunition and explosives into the port of
Halifax.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral's speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Jodoin
for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
it is an old and honourable tradition of this
bouse that, when a new parliament assembles
and a new Speaker is chosen from our number to preside over our deliberations, we
should offer him our good wishes and felicitations. If His Honour the Speaker is not
entirely submerged by the good wishes. that
have been extended to him by those who
have preceded me in this debate, then I
certainly tender mine to him most warmly.
And if he is submerged in good wishes I
hope that when he emerges be will learn that
I have extended my felicitations to him.
The responsibility of our Speaker is a
considerable one. It is his duty to preside
over the deliberations of this assembly, and
if at times we stray from the parliamentary
rules of debate it is his duty to quietly but
firmly direct our feet back onto the right
path. I have no doubt, sir, that you will
discharge the responsibilities of your high

DECEMBER 10, 1953
office in the tradition of the many who have
preceded you and whose work stands as a
glowing record in our annals.
I should also like to offer rny felicitations
to the new Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who was only
recentiy appointed to this chamber. I do flot
suppose it matters whether he is the Leader
uf the Government in the Senate or-as the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) suggested-the Leader of
the Senate in the Government. In this respect
I arn rather inclined to agree with my colleague from New Westminster, but that is
immaterial. We ail wish our new leader
well, and we are certain that his long
experience in public 11f e, which includes the
Speakership of the House of Commons during
the last parliament, will enable him to make
a useful contribution to the work of this
chamber. He will find, as I suspect he
already has found, that the tempo of discussion and the manner of debate here is somewhat easier-shall I say somewhat milderthan in the other place. That is ail to the
good; and it is in keeping with our tradition
and with what the framers of our constitution had in mind when they provided for a
second chamber. Some people in this country have the mistaken idea that when
members are appointed to this house they
immediately proceed to eat of the fruit of the
lotus tree and dwell forever after in a state
of dreamy forgetfulness. By our deliberations here and by our contribution to the
governing of Canada we shouid be able s0 to
establish ourselves that the Senate wiil earn
the respect and good will of ail right-thinking
Canadians.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Sînce the new parliament
was summoned congratulations have been
extended in many directions, and I wish to
add to them by sincereiy complimenting the
mover (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin) and the seconder
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. There are
few members now in either house who came
to parliament as early as 1917, when I did.
Since then I have heard a great many
motions moved and seconded, both here and
in the other house, for an Address in reply
to the Speech frorn the Throne, but-and I
say this with conviction-I cannot recaîl any
occasion when 'the speeches of the mover and
the seconder were expressed in more felicitous language and with greater clarity of
thought than were those of the two newlyappointed senators to whomn I have referred.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
83280--9

Han. Mr. Crerar: As an old-timer, I extend
to both of thern my warmest congratulations.
I feel it incumbent on me to say a word
or two of welcorne to the other new senators
who sit here for the first time this session.
Some of thern were unknown to me before
corning here; others I had known in the
House of ýCommons in stormier days. I know
these new senators will not be content to
rest upon their oars but will make useful
contributions here. It would be invidious to
single out individual members for speciai
mention, but I do express the hope that
the new senator frorn Lauzon (Hon. Mr.
Tremblay) will occasionally break into song
in this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We carry on our deliberations here in a very free-and-easy way, and
I have often thought that if from time to
time a littie spice were added it would help
us. When I was a member of the House of
Commons our colleague from Lauzon used
to lead the house in the singing of Alouette,
There's a Long Long Trail Awinding and
When Irish Eyes are Smiling. The honourable senator has an extensive knowledge of
music and song, and I hope that occasionally
he will put it to good use ini this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I now corne to a consideration of the Speech from the Throne,
upon which this debate is founded. Let me
say at once that the speech read by His
Excellency, which of course was given to
hirn by his advisors, is in many respects a
pretty clear-cut statement. It is brief, and
that to me gives it additional menit. It has
the further menit of being iucid and clear.
I think any person reading the speech can
get a clear understanding of its intent. I now
wish to deal with a few points mentioned
in it. First, there is an appropriate reference
to the coronation of our young Queen early
in the summer of this year, the occasion of
which evoked in a peculiar way expressions
of good will and good wishes from the whole
civîlized world.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Crerar: These expressions of good
will came not only frorn the subjects of Her
Majesty, but from a great multitude of others
who feit keenly the heavy burden of responsibility assumed by this young woman who
whole-heartediy had dedicated herseif to the
welfare of her people.
I turn now to another very important part
in the Speech from the Throne, namely, its
reference to the search for a permanent and
durable peace, and its affirmation that the

SENATE
purpose of the government, in full co-operation with our allies, is to continue to build
up and strengthen the free nations in their
efforts to deter and prevent aggression in the
future. That opens a very broad field. I am
convinced that the government could take
no other course than the one it has submitted
to parliament and has placed before the
Canadian people.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. M. Crerar: Rightly or wrongly, I
believe today that the world is at a great
crossroads of history. We are at one of those
occasional periods in history when the fate
of the world is pretty much in the balance.
That has happened before; and some of the
civilisations to which it has happened in the
past have declined. As far as I am concerned, I am pretty well convinced there is a
possibility that our civilization, as we have
known it, may disappear into a deep gulf.
That, let me repeat. is not beyond the bounds
of possibility. And so this suggestion that on
the advice of Her Majesty's advisers in
Canada we propose to continue doing our
part to maintain and build up a force to
resist aggression, is worthy indeed of our
whole-hearted support. Now that does not
mean that our support must be an unreasonable and a blind support. We, as a parliament, have a perfect right to criticize here
or there the methods by which it is proposed
to achieve the objective. That is particularly
true in the matter of spending by the defence
services. Parliament has a right, and not
only a right but a duty, to scrutinize these
expenditures, to see that our part is effectively done; but, with that qualification, I
whole-heartedly support the point laid down
by the government in this paragraph of the
Speech from the Throne.
I am not quite so optimistic, however, of
the hope expressed in this next paragraph as
the government would appear to be, from
a reading of it. That is the paragraph which
bas to do with this whole wretched business
in Korea. May I read it:
We have every reason for satisfaction that
through the use for the first time of collective
police action the objective of the United Nations
The
in Korea has been substantially achieved.
aggressors have been driven back, the fighting has
ceased and an armistice has been concluded. My
government earnestly hopes that a political conference will ultimately succeed in restoring peace
in Korea.

That, of course is a hope we all can echo
but I, for my part, am not very confident
that peace in Korea is going to be achieved
at an early date. We all recall the occasion
of this Korean war, and I think it is well
that we keep it very clearly in mind. Before
the war with Japan ended there was an

understanding that Russian forces would
occupy the northern part of Korea which juts
up against Manchuria, and that the United
States forces would occupy the southern part;
and the dividing line, as I recall, was to be
the 38th parallel of latitude. It is a matter
of history that Japan had long occupied
Korea, but Japan was now out of the picture.
Governments had to be established in South
Korea and in North Korea.
Now the Russians, it is quite clear, so
managed things in the northern part of that
unhappy country that they left a communist
government in charge. South Korea was set
up under a president and a parliament. I
am not here saying how democratic that
parliament may have been, but it was an
elective parliament, and South Korea applied
for and was granted admission to the United
Nations organization.
In June, 1950, the North Koreans, without
any declaration of war, without warning,
crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South
Korea and it soon became reasonably clear
that they had been equipped and trained for
the purpose. The United Nations took action
-the only action they could take under the
circumstances, under the provisions of the
charter of the United Nations-and decided
to resist the aggression of the North Koreans.
Thus, the war began. It see-sawed back and
forth for many months, and then there was
talk of an armistice; but the discussions for
an armistice between the two combatants
that should have been achieved in a matter
of a few weeks went on month after month,
for almost two years, until finally it was
achieved. But now very little progress is
being made toward establishing a conference
for the consideration of a peace treaty.
Without in any way being unfair or unjust,
I must say it does seem, and all the evidence
points to it, that China, which entered the
war with Russia behind her, wants to prolong as much as possible the consideration
of this treaty, and I think for a very obvious
reason. The United Nations have today in
South Korea more than 500,000 military
personnel, eighty per cent of whom are from
the United States. The United States are
carrying the great burden of the expenditure,
and this is costing the American treasury
more than two billion dollars a year.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question, for information? Does he include
the South Korean army, which is a very
large army, in the figure of 500,000 that he
just gave?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No. I should have made
clear that this figure is exclusive of the
South Korean forces. There are not only

DECEMBER 10, 1953
the military personnel, not only the soldiers,
but all the supporting forces, convoy lines
and all that sort of thing; and exclusive of
South Korean forces, there are more than five
hundred thousand United Nations personnel,
eighty per cent of whom are Americans.
Hon. Mr. King: Surely not 80 per cent of
the 500,000 are Americans?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes, 80 per cent are
Americans.
Hon. Mr. King: But is it true to say that
80 per cent of the fighting forces in Korea,
including the South Koreans, are Americans?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No; I said aside from
the South Koreans.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are you including the
South Korean army in the figure of 500,000?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No; that is exclusive of
the South Korean army.
Honourable senators, after those interruptions, to which I have no objection at all,
may I proceed?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend know how many South Koreans are
in the South Korean army?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No; I do not have that
information.
The fact is, honourable senators, there has
been a delay even in moving towards consideration of a peace treaty in Korea. I
suggest this signifies a desire on the part of
our opponents in this war-the communist
governments of China and North Korea--to
avoid a peace treaty or to delay it as long as
possible. What they desire, or appear to
desire, is neither peace nor war. I am convinced they do not want a resumption of the
fighting, but I equally believe that they want
to delay the accomplishment of peace. And
for what reason? For the reason that they
can force the United Nations to keep in that
area, some 500,000 personnel, exclusive of
the South Koreans, at tremendous cost to
the treasuries of the countries involved. This
situation has been one of the factors in
causing the frustration over Korea that exists
today in the United States. And we know
further that to some degree at least it has
been a factor in creating a difference of
opinion between the members of the United
Nations participating in the war in Korea.
But trouble exists not only in South Korea:
the French nation has been bogged duwn in
a conflict against the communist influence in
Indo-China for seven years, and it is draining
her personnel and wealth. What more effective measure could communist Russia and
China take than to cause that state of affairs
to continue as long as possible?
83280-9j

It is worthwhile remembering, honourable
senators, that China has an estimated population of 450 million people. It is becoming
very clear that the European influence on
the Far Eastern Asiatic countries is declining.
The North Koreans could not have carried
on the Korean war without assistance from
communist China, and even after China
entered the conflict it could not have been
maintained long had not Russia provided
military supplies for the use of China and
North Korea. Of this there appears to be
pretty clear evidence. And let us remember
all this was in violation of her undertaking
as a signatory to the United Nations charter,
by which she was bound not to give assistance to any aggressor nation against the
United Nations. It is difficult, honourable
senators, to see many rays of light through
this state of affairs.
I shail discuss now what I regard as a
most important declaration of government
policy. As honourable senators know, I have
not at all times found myself in wholehearted sympathy with everything the government has put forward in the past. But
this is a declaration which we can all
applaud. It has to do with Canada's trade,
and our efforts to extend the boundaries of
trade by liberalizing the conditions under
which trade between nations is carried on.
This declaration earnestly supports the agreements reached at Geneva, at Annecy and
Torquay having to do with the extension of
the Reciprocal Trade Agreements policy. This
declaration of policy, honourable senators,
is most important, for if Canada is to prosper
and grow as we hope she will, we must trade
with the nations of the world. In other
words, we must find markets for our products.
At the moment there is a good deal of concern in western Canada, from which I come,
over the uncertainty of finding wide enough
markets to absorb our surplus wheat. I shall
speak later to that subject; but I think it is
obvious that the course our trade is now taking is not a dangerous one for this country.
As a matter of fact, in the first nine months
of this calendar year approximately twothirds of our total international trade, including both exports and imports, were with
the United States. If that proves anythingand I think it proves something-it is that
the American market is, by and large, the
great future market for Canadian products.
I say that because the United States, with
a population today of 160 million will, at
the present rate of growth, have a population
of 175 to 180 million by 1960, and that is
only seven years away. In the history of a
country seven years is but a short time. If
we project our thoughts to the end of this
century, only forty-seven years away, we

SENATE

can assume that in all probability, unless
the world is devastated and ruined by war,
the population of the United States will then
have increased to 230 million, 240 million,
possibly 250 million. My memory goes back
to the arguments over the reciprocity issue in
1911. That is forty-two years behind us. It
is only necessary to look forward over a little
longer period, to the end of this century, to
throw into perspective the possibilities of
trade development. What position is Canada in to participate in that development?
One of the most amazing happenings since
the end of the last war is the amount of new
wealth which has been discovered in Canada.
For a long time we, at any rate in the west,
held to the hope that some day oil would be
found in the prairie provinces, but for many
years, except in a very limited way, that
hope proved vain. Today Alberta is one of
the great oil-producing areas of the world.
Oil has been found too in large quantities in
Saskatchewan, and even in Manitoba, where
only ten years ago any suggestion that oil
might be discovered there would have been
dismissed as fantastic.
Another important resource is our iron ore
reserves. It is well known that the great
supplies of good iron ore in the State of
Minnesota are being reduced to somewhere
near the vanishing point. Now iron and steel
are basic to development of any countryI was going to add, any civilization. We have
discovered in the far reaches of Labrador
immense bodies of very rich iron ore; there
is another large reserve about 130 or 140
miles west of Fort William and Port Arthur;
and in the hills north of Sault Ste. Marie
hundreds of millions of tons have been
located. So there are abundant reserves of
this great basic resource in our own country.
In the next place, I would like to remark
upon the revision of our own ideas about
Canada. It is interesting to read what was
written about this country in former days.
At the time of Confederation, and even fifty
years ago, the prevalent conception was that
north of a narrow strip along the international
boundary line, lay nothing but a frozen
wilderness of rock and ice and snow. That
notion has disappeared. Today, over all this
great pre-Cambrian belt which stretches from
the coast of Labrador on the east, through
central Canada and up to the Arctic, great
mineral wealth has been found, and there
are many geologists who believe that the
surface has only been scratched. Further
west, in British Columbia, discoveries of
equal importance are being made, and Canada's far western province promises to become
one of the richest of them all. These things

were not conceived of a few years back, certainly not half a century ago. They evidence
the immense potentialities of this country.
But in order to support a thriving and happy
population-for Canadians in the main, I
believe, are willing to work-it is necessary
to find markets. The resources I have mentioned are those which in the United States
are constantly diminishing, and the people of
that country will look to us in the future for
their main source of supply. I need not speak
of uranium, that new wonder metal. Quite
evidently Canada is one of the main sources
of the production of uranium oxide.
It is true that at times minor causes of irritation arise between ourselves and our
American friends. Recently the United States
threatened to increase the duty on Canadian
oats, and a rather sharp issue arose a year
or so ago in respect to some dairy products.
But to my mind any talk of retaliation against
the United States is foolish. I say that
because inexorably the logic of events points
to the benefit of Canada in this matter of
trade with the United States. Great bodies
such as their chambers of trade and their
banking association, as well as some of their
leading industrialists, are coming out frankly
in advocacy of a lower-tariff policy. If the
United States are to recover from the rest
of the world the principal, or even the interest, on the money which, in one way and
another, they have invested there, they can
do so only by lowering their tariffs and increasing their purchases from other nations.
This was the policy which, practised throughout the nineteenth century, and particularly
in the latter half of that century, made Great
Britain strong all over the world.
I have said enough about that. I want
now to say a word or two about wheat. I
am quite sure that my colleagues who have
been in this house during previous sessions
are under no illusions about some aspects of
this problem. I am as convinced as ever
'that the wheat marketing policies we have
followed in the last seven years have been
unsound, and I think the inevitably poor
results of these policies are now upon us.
However, I do not wish to discuss that phase
of the problem at this time. I wish to discuss,
rather, the criticism that is being made of
the government from certain parts of western
Canada, and even from some of our honourable friends in this chamber. We cannot
get away from the fact that the law of supply
and demand is bound to operate in the long
run. What is happening is that the great
vacuum of foodstuffs and other commodities,

DECEMBER 10, 1953

created by the disorganization of war, is now
being filled and most countries are returning
to a more normal state of affairs.
There is no doubt that the payment of high
prices stimulates the production of wheat
wherever it is grown. I am sure the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson), who knows a great deal about the
subject of wheat, will agree there is scarcely
a country where wheat cannot be produced.
For example, Turkey in Asia Minor has been
an exporter of wheat to western Europe in
the past few years. Sweden, which most
people believed could not produce sufficient
wheat for its own needs, has been exporting
that product to Great Britain, and wheat is
now being produced in North Africa. Wheatproducing countries, particularly Canada and
the United States, have experienced a succession of excellent crops. The total wheat
production in Canada in 1952 was estimated
at approximately 680 million bushels, and
this year it has been estimated to be at least
570 to 580 million bushels. Our wheat marketing has been affected by 'the policy of the
American government, which in turn has
naturally been influenced by Congress.
Politicians, of course, are just as eager to
harvest votes in the United States as they
are in Canada, and the American government adopted a policy of support prices which
left a burden on the treasury. It also left
the farmers free to produce whatever they
wished. That policy is still in effect, although
I understand the present Secretary of Agriculture in the United States desires to
change it.
I should like to place a few figures on the
record. Honourable senators are aware that
the crop year begins in August, when our
farmers commence to harvest their grain, and
because of the cut-off date at the end of
July we are able to have accurate statistical
data as to what wheat supplies are on hand
as of the first of August of each year. Our
carry-over as of August 1 this year-which
means the amount of wheat available in sight
on that date-amounted to 362 million
bushels. At the same date the carry-over in
the United States was 580 million bushels,
which is not nearly so large, comparing their
population with Canada's. An interesting
point is that in the four major exporting
countries of the world-Canada, the United
States, Australia and the Argentine-the
carry-over on August 1, 1952, was 503 million
bushels, which was somewhat short of the
normal carry-over even at that time. As of
August 1, 1953, the total carry-over for these
four countries was 1,083,000,000 bushels. The

Agricultural Research Department of the
Searle Grain Company Limited, which is
usually accurate in its calculations, estimates
that the carry-over of these four countries at
August 1, 1954, will be 1,400,000,000 bushels,
which figure is almost three times what it
was two years earlier.
In the face of these figures there can be
only one result-the operation of the old
law of supply and demand. Notwithstanding
all the devices that might be used to try
and maintain prices, unless there is active
intervention by the government and complete control of marketing and production or
the subsidizing of grain production, these
prices will naturally be reflected from the
conditions I have just outlined. So far as
I am concerned, I do not think that any
criticism can be made of the government on
this aspect of our wheat production. The
government cannot claim credit for the bumper wheat crops of the last three years, nor
can it be saddled with the consequences that
have resulted from that large supply of
wheat. It is time that we readjusted our
thinking on these questions.
What appals me more than anything else
is the growth of the idea that in some mysterious fashion a government can solve every
problem that is placed before it, that it must
solve the problems of individuals and of
communities. That is a dangerous idea. In
that connection, I should like to speak of the
position in western Canada. It is just fifty
years ago that the first grain growers associations were organized in Saskatchewan and
Manitoba, and Alberta followed a year or two
later. I feel bound to say that the leaders
of the farmers' organizations in those days
were rpen of vision as well as men of action.
They did not ask for favours from the government, nor did they ask for subsidized
prices, or anything of that kind. All they
asked was that the tariff discrimination
against them should be removed, because
they were paying a 25 per cent duty in agricultural implements; they wanted a fair
field, to which they were entitled. And later
they asked for and got amendments to the
Canada Grain Act giving them further protection. That early spirit appears to have
gone by the board. It is a matter of deep
regret to me that some of the most powerful of our farmers' organizations are coming
cap in hand to the government and saying:
"You must give us some protection, you must
put tariffs on the oils and fats that go into
margarine; you must give us price guarantees-you must do this, that and the other

SENATE
thing". I am too old to change, and I shall
never have any sympathy either here or
elsewhere with demands of that kind.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think such demands are
entirely wrong, and I am as convinced as I
can be of anything that they are wholly
inimical to the best interests of the agricultural community in this country.
May I refer to a paragraph in the Speech
from the Throne, which reads as follows:
As further steps in helping to improve social
welfare, co-ordinated plans for rehabilitation of
disabled persons are being worked out with the
provinces and a measure to facilitate the establishment nationwide of a federal provincial assistance program for totally disabled persons will be
submitted for your consideration.

That is an important paragraph in the
speech, and is well worth thinking about. It
seems to me that today more and more
people are putting the emphasis on security
and that there is an increasing tendency to
sacrifice freedom and liberty for security.
That is true not only in Canada but in the
United States and in Great Britain. Therein,
I think, lies great danger. Security, of course,
is desirable. But what are social security and
social welfare costing this country today? It
is interesting perhaps to view this matter
objectively. It is estimated by government
experts that our gross national production
this year will reach $24 billion. Of course,
that does not mean that the people of Canada
will get $24 billion, for certain deductions
must be made from this amount to arrive
at our net national income. This net income
will probably be about $19 billion. The net
national income represents the total amount
received from the activities of all the Canadian people.
The first question I wish to put to this
honourable house is: How much of that
amount today is absorbed in taxation?
Taking all levels of government in Canada,
federal, provincial and municipal, I suspect
that fully one-third of the net national
income is paid in taxes by all the Canadian
people. I have not the figures for the past
two years, but I have those for three years
ago. Taxpayers are able to pay this large
amount by virtue of the fact that Canada is
a rich and productive country and her people
are skilful and willing to work. But that
ratio is too high. There are sound economists
who contend that the danger limit is reached
when more than 25 per cent of a country's
net national income is absorbed in taxes.
From this total burden of taxation, I should
think about 1 billion, 600 million dollars is
spent today on social welfare of one kind
and another, if soldiers pensions-which, of

course, must be paid-are included, and of
this sum well over $1 billion is spent in the
federal field.
Hon. Mr. King: Does that include federal
and provincial?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I said at all levels of
government, federal, provincial and municipal.
I am not against social security at all, but
I do suggest that this expense is a very
heavy burden, and I raise the matter so that
honourable senators may think about it, because if there should be a decline in our
economy and something in the nature of a
depression or a severe recession, what would
the effect be on taxation, and could we maintain the heavy cost of these social security
charges?
If it were found impossible to
maintain these services, ex.cept by inflated
currency, which of course would be madness,
this country might be confronted with
dangerous political trouble. That is my considered view, and I put these thoughts to my
colleagues here, not with any thought in
mind that I know more about this matter
than anybody else does, 'but as being well
worth the serious thought of honourable
senators.
I have spoken far longer than I had
intended. May I say this in conclusion.
There is no doubt that the world today is
passing through very dangerous times. The
great danger to the world, as I see it, is not
alone the danger of war and destruction
that may come. The greater danger lies
in the deterioration and possible disintegration of the moral and spiritual forces of
mankind that are the very foundation and
basis of civilization.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is no use in trying to imagine for a moment that by purely
materialistic means can we move out of
these troublesome times into a sunlit future.
We ýcannot do it. It is a matter, I think
of some concern that those old sanctions that
are inherent in the moral and spiritual
qualities of mankind are today being subjected to strains and stresses greater than
they have been subjected to ever before in
human history; and I would humbly suggest
to my colleagues in this house that when
we are considering the multitude of matters
that come before us, we keep ever in mind
that material progress is not alone the
essential thing. We must keep our eyes
steadily on the effect of all our laws on the
moral and spiritual progress of our Canadian
people.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

DECEMBER 10, 1953
Hon. George P. Burchill:
Honourable
senators, I am sure we have all listened with
a great deal of pleasure and interest to the
speech made by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) who, after so
many years in the public life of this country,
can speak with such a wealth of experience.
I personally enjoyed his speech very much
indeed.
Now, honourable senators, I am not going
to make any lengthy contribution to this
debate, but I rise for the purpose of using
the occasion to make one or two observations.
If His Honour the Speaker has emerged
sufficiently from the congratulations which
have been showered upon him, I hope he
will accept mine; and I want to add this,
that I hope the repetition of congratulations
will not make them seem any less sincere.
His Honour the Speaker and I became associated before he was called to the Senate, in
the days of the formation of the Maritime
Lumber Bureau, and I have followed his
career ever since with a great deal of interest.
It is my sincere wish that he will enjoy much
happiness and success in his new position.
The honourable Leader of the Government
in the Senate, or Leader of the Senate in the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) comes to
this bouse from the Speaker's Chair of the
House of Commons, where he earned a reputation for impartiality and was held in the
very highest possible esteem by members of
all parties. His qualities of mind and character are such that I am sure this chamber
under his leadership will make a very effective contribution to the work of the Parlia-

him for his courage in standing up in this
chamber and saying what he really believes.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Another reason that I
wanted to say a word in this debate was to
express my pride as a Canadian, and also as a
New Brunswicker, in the recent announcement that a great Canadian scientist and
former citizen of our province, Dr. C. J.
Mackenzie, bas been awarded the Kelvin
medal. Dr. Mackenzie, a former president
of the National Research Council, and until
recently the president of the Atomic Energy
Control Board at Chalk River, has earned an
international reputation as one of the foremost scientists of the world. He bas made a
notable contribution to Canadian scientific
advancement, and in congratulating him as
a fellow Canadian, I want to add that his
native province is proud of such a distinguished son. Dr. Mackenzie is another of
the long list of eminent Canadian church
leaders, educators, men in public life, jurists,
bankers and industrialists, in all parts of
Canada and in fact in the United States, who
have come from very humble homes in the
Maritime-perhaps I should say the Atlantic
-provinces.
My colleague from Nova Scotia,
the honourable senator from Milford-Hants
(Hon. Mr. Hawkins), who spoke in this debate
yesterday, referred to the exports from the
maritime provinces. I just wonder if he
agrees with what I have said before, that the
most valuable export from the Maritimes is
brains.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
ment of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: For proof of that one
While we do not always agree with all need not go any further than the present
the views of the Leader of the Opposition membership of this chamber. We have the
(Hon. Mr. Haig), I am sure we all agree that honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
the Senate is poorer without him. I know Mr. King), the honourable senator from VanI am expressing the views of all members couver South (Hon. Mr. Ferris), the honourof the Senate when I say that we hope he able senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turwill be restored to health before long and geon), the honourable senator from Ottawa
make an early return to this chamber.
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), and the honourable

a lasting effect on most of us, and after so
many years of fair sailing, it is the part of
caution to keep one's eyes cocked to the
windward, so it is reassuring to hear the
views expressed by these men who should
know of what they speak.
When I entered the Senate the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
told me that stories did not go well in parliament. However, I am going to take a chance
and tell a short story which I think expresses
the view of Canadian business today. On a
train running between London and Aberdeen
a lady noticed that the gentleman with whom
she was sharing a seat got off at every station, where he appeared to have some business, and always came back to his seat just
before the train started off again. When ber
curiosity could no longer be contained, she
asked him why he did this. He replied that
he had been to London to consult a specialist
about his health, and having been told that
he was suffering from a serious disease which
might result in his death at any momenthe was-as a true Scotman-buying his ticket
from station to station.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Burchill: In spite of the reassurances we have today, I should like to
remind honourable senators that there are
in Canada at least two economies: that of
Ontario and Quebec, and that of the Maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: What 'about the West?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Never mind the West at
the moment.
For the past twelve months there has been
a definite slowing up of business in the
Atlantic provinces-my friends from Newfoundland will forgive me if through habit
I sometimes refer to the Maritime provinces
-and I cannot give any better proof of this
statement than by pointing to the fact that
the telephone toll calls in the Bell system,
which operates in Ontario and Quebec, show
an entirely different trend from those in the
Maritime provinces. For the year 1953 the
Bell Company records an increase in messages of about 7 per cent over the preceding
year, while in our district of New Brunswick
-and I think Nova Scotia shows the same
trend-the calls have decreased in number
by 3 per cent, showing a total difference
between the two areas of about 10 per cent.
Honourable senators, I can think of no better
way of measuring the tempo of business
activity than by the use of the telephone,
which has become such an important medium
of communication in our economic and social
life.
I endorse everything the honourable senator from Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins)

said yesterday about the industrial situation
in the Maritimes and our dependence upon
export markets. Our problems arise chiefly
from the fact that we are obliged to buy in a
market where manufacturers enjoy a measure
of protection, and sell in a world market
against world competition; but we recognize
the fact that other sections of the country
have their problems too. The West has its
wheat problem; and yesterday the senator
from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) told
us of the butter problem; and the farmers of
the Atlantic provinces, including Prince
Edward Island, have their problems. But
while it is natural for us to be chiefly concerned with the prosperity of the particular
section from which we come we, as Canadians, if we are honest with ourselves, must
admit that we have little to complain of and
much for which to be thankful.
I recently met a gentleman who told me
that his son had been one of a group of university students who had toured the Far
East during the past summer. They had visited India and had an opportunity of seeing
many parts of that vast country, and spent a
month at Kashmir University. The experiences of the group-the extreme heat, the
food, and the conditions under which they
lived-had been utterly exhausting, and the
boy's health had suffered as a result. The
young man's father made this observation:
"If the people of Canada could take a trip
to India and some other eastern countries
and see their standard of living and the
conditions under which people exist there,
they would never cease to thank God for
Canada and their Canadian citizenship." We
know that Canada, with its rich natural
resources and the character of its people, is a
great country.
And when independent
journalists declare that Canada is the best
governed country in the world, when Canada's voice at the United Nations is listened
to with respect all over the world, when
papers like the New York Times say that
other nations can take a lesson from Canada,
and when our currency selling at a premium
in the money markets of the world, I think
we should thank Heaven that Canada can
produce men of the stature and the statesmanship of Mr. St. Laurent, Mr. Howe, Mr.
Pearson, and Mr. Abbott. As for ourselves,
members of this chamber, it behooves us all,
in the light of our responsibilities as senators
of Canada, to see to it that we further and
support the policies which make for national
prosperity, national security and national
unity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

DECEMBER 10, 1953
Hon. James H. King: Honourable senators,
I debated in my own mind whether I should
take part in this discussion of the Speech
from the Throne. I have been associated in
a ministerial capacity with both a provincial
legislature and the federal parliament, and it
may be that had I the facility of speech
enjoyed by my honourable friends from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and from Bathurst (Hon. Mr. Burchill) who have spoken this
afternoon, my position in this country might
have been a little different. But I was trained
in a profession which does not talk about
itself; its members are under oath not to
reveal their professional relations.
I entered politics in 1903, just fifty years
ago, and I have had, I think, a wonderful
experience. It has been my privilege to meet
not only the great men who have come to the
Parliament of Canada, but many of those in
the legislature of the various provinces, and
the knowledge and the memories which have
flowed from that association are well worth
while.
From time to time, public life in this
country has been marked by much bickering,
great trouble, and unfairness in debate. It is
my impression in this connection that some
members of the House of Commons and
other legislative bodies have gone too far in
their criticisms of one another, and that
public life has deteriorated as a consequence.
My experience-and I am now old-leads
me to think that men who are selected and
elected by the popular vote, represent some
viewpoint which should be, and I think is,
respected by our political leaders, and I
regret any tendency to use language about
an opponent which is clearly unfair. If the
young men and women who are being educated in our universities, and may follow
us in public life, will study history and read
the lives of Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, Right Honourable Mackenzie
King and some of our political contemporaries, they will be inspired, I believe, to
elevate the tone of public life. Membership
in the Parliament of Canada is, or should
be, the greatest recognition that any man
or woman who aspires to public service can
receive. We have in some of our educational
institutions today mock parliaments, and I
hope that our universities and high schools,
and all those persons who, throughout our
educational system, are responsible for
developing the ideas of young Canadians,
will try to persuade them that, in the selection of those who should represent the
people in the legislatures and parliarnent of
this country, their choice should be made
from men and women whom they can respect
and hold in high esteem.
83280-10

There has been a tendency to belittle
public men. As far as I am concerned, I have
been in public life for half a century, and
practised medicine for twenty years, and I
have no apologies to make to the public for
either of these activities. I have done what
I thought was right within my profession
and as a politician, and, surveying what has
taken place during my lifetime in the legislatures and the parliament of Canada, I have
no personal regrets.
Absorbed in our day-to-day activities,
probably we do not realize what has happened in Canada over the past thirty to
thirty-five years. In 1921-22, when I came
to Ottawa, no foreign power was represented
here. Great Britain was ably represented in
this country by a High Commissioner.
Canada soon began to send representatives,
capable men like Strathcona and Perley, to
Great Britain. The first minister from a
foreign power, Mr. Phillips of the United
States, was appointed to Canada in June 1927,
about three months after our present Governor General, the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, became Canada's minister at Washington. It is generally recognized that Canada
is rapidly becoming a great country, and
some twenty to twenty-five nations now have
diplomatic representatives in Ottawa. One
reason, among others, why they are here is
to study the development of Canada.
Although this country is new in the field of
international politics, it is the world's third
largest trading nation, being superseded only
by the United States and Great Britain. However, Canadians should continue to be modest
and not go shouting these facts from their
house tops. Nature has provided us with
great natural resources, and I disagree with
those who maintain that we should conserve
them. In my opinion we should sell whatever goods other nations are ready to buy
from us, and I believe this has been the
policy of our present government.
Much has been said during this debate
about Canada's wheat production. Canadians
should realize that wheat is one of the most
valuable commodities we have to offer on
the world market. It takes hard work to
grow wheat successfully, but I am certain
that our farmers, those blessed with devoted
wives and children and good farms, are the
happiest men in Canada today. The Canadian government does not look upon our
farmers with disfavour, by any means, but
we must remember that great changes that
have taken place in agriculture, as in other
industries. Such industries as agriculture,
mining and fisheries have taken advantage
of m'odern scientific developments. I remember that when the eight-hour day was introduced in British Columbia the mine owners

SENATE
predicted they would be ruined, but the use
of modern mining techniques have kept the
mines flourishing. The honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
recently told the bouse that it costs thousands
of dollars to equip a modern farm. The day
of the hoe and rake, which I used as a boy,
have passed. No Canadian industry has a
greater chance to prosper than agriculture,
so long as it employs modern scientific
methods, organizes within reason, and
refrains from demanding subsidies in Ottawa.
After all, the success of that industry, like
the success of any other, depends on the
principle of supply and demand. This is not
an easy thing to control, and it can only be
done by smaller and larger communities,
national and international areas working
together.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has had long experience in
public life. He assembles his facts with care
and speaks with eloquence. He made a great
speech this afternoon, une that I am sure
would have proven of immense value to the
United Nations Assembly had it been
delivered before that body.
Honourable senators, I rose today because
as one of the senior members of the SenateI believe I rank seventh according to length
of service-I wanted to pay tribute to those
persons who were recently honoured by
being summoned to this chamber. I heartily
congratulate them and express my pleasure
in seeing them here. I know they will become
valuable members. I think the Prime Minister showed great wisdom in selecting and
recommending the appointment of the three
lady senators who were sworn in at the
opening of parliament. As a native of New
Brunswick, I am pleased that one of them
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) is from the senatorial
area known as the Maritimes. I am also
delighted that women have made such a
mark in the public life of Quebec that it was
felt appropriate to select a lady (Hon. Mrs.
Jodoin) to be a representative of that great
province here. And the new senator from
British Columbia (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) is well
qualified to represent that part of western
Canada in this distinguished chamber. I am
sure that they will join with the two ladies
who have been members of the Senate for
some years, in making valuable contributions
to the work of this chamber and of various
committees.
We have heard excellent speeches in this
debate, so good that I hesitated before taking
part in it; but I do wish to identify myself
with the first debate in this new parliament,
the eighth new parliament that has met since
I first came to Ottawa.

The honourable senator from Cochrane
(Hon. Mr. Bradette), an old friend of mine,
delivered an excellent speech. He was elected
to the House of Commons in the year 1926.
He was then a young man, and managed a
business in northern Ontario. Not only did
he become a useful member of the House of
Commons, but within his first four years as
a member he graduated from Ottawa University. The honourable senator is a splendid
example to young men aspiring to a seat in
parliament. The other day he spoke about
the serious relationship existing between
labour and management in his constituency.
I listened to his speech with great interest,
because his political experience has been
much like my own. I thought he spoke with
fairness, and in the hope that the unpleasant
relationship existing in the mining country
would cease. He was criticized by an officer
of one of the great labour unions, who
referred to his speech as having been made
"in the sanctuary of the Senate". I do not
object to the term used by the labour leader.
However, it is here and in the House of
Commons that these matters should be discussed; for, after all, parliament is supreme.
I have had a long and wide experience.
I went West in 1898, and had the opportunity
to act as physician and surgeon to the labour
forces that built a great railway, the
one through the Crowsnest Pass. I had
travelling to do, not in an automobile or on
a speeder, but on horseback, on railway pump
cars and in box cars, and I slept and ate
with those who were engaged in that great
railway undertaking. I now wish to congratulate the labour unions and their
organizers upon the fact that they have, I
think, succeeded in giving labour almost a
leading place in our activities. That place
is not superior to the position of parliament
or of the legislatures, but after many long
years of struggle labour today does command
a prominent place.
British Columbia has been pretty far in
advance in enacting social legislation. In
that province we have laws providing workmen's compensation, various forms of social
security allowances, and so on. I think the
legislature there has been of the progressive
type, probably because people of the West
are less conservative than those in the eastern provinces. A few years ago the then
coalition government in British Columbia
passed a law requiring that in the case of a
labour dispute, and before a strike was
declared, there must be a vote on the issue
by members of the union, and that vote
must be taken under government supervision.
I think our organized labour friends have
accepted that legislation pretty well. We

DECEMBER 10, 1953

know from experience gathered over many
years that it has been necesary for the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures to surround the franchise with great
care, so as to prevent abuses in the registering of public opinion. The same coalition
government of British Columbia passed what
is known as a conciliation measure, whereby
in the event of trouble between labour and
management there would be an opportunity
for them to go before a conciliation
board. I think that a conciliation board
serves a useful purpose. I am not sure what
has happened recently in the province, but I
understand the newly-elected government
has dismissed the permanent board and is
appointing from time to time a temporary
board. I am not quite sure of this, but I
believe I have read somewhere that a suggestion was made recently in Quebec that
that province should set up a board of conciliation. Now, when a suggestion such as that
is made nobody should get angry or take
offence. After all, experience has shown, not
only in our lifetime but through the centuries
that it has been necessary for governments
everywhere to set up tribunals to decide
what is fair between individuals. Today this
principle has been carried much further.
Tribunals now decide what is fair between
corporations and corporations or other institutions. And, as we all know, the United
Nations established an international court by
which problems that exist between countries
may be considered and decided. I am very
sorry to say, though, that very few representations or cases have been referred to that
court. It is in line, I think., with the views
of people with common sense that there
should. and must be some tribunal to which
those who have grievances may apply for
settlement.
I would not for a moment suggest that
the right to strike should be taken from
labour. However, I believe that we may
hope that some day, in the interest of the
nation, which comes first, and in the interest
of labour and of management, it will be
found to their common advantage to have a
board to deal with questions in dispute between them. It may be called a conciliation
board or given some other title; but in any
event we may hope that in time there will
be a tribunal before which those who have
contending views may state their case and
have a final decision made under the laws
of the country. I realize that that suggestion will not be looked upon with favour by
labour leaders, but I think it is worthy of
their consideration. We know that organized
labour today is able to select from among its
83280-10J

number leaders with experience and knowledge and pay them more than is paid the
Prime Minister of Canada; and it can employ
experts who understand conditions, and can
direct labour organizations.
Conditions have changed to a vast extent
over the past fifty years. There was a time
when a man could build a factory and start
an industry, and it was his own. That is no
longer possible. The need for developing the
world's resources has brought about the formation of large companies in which the public
may become financially interested. But having regard to the disputes between management and labour, I am afraid that today the'
dominant attitude is "Let George do it, and
pass the cost on to the public."
Very little reference is made today to a
great book on labour by a great man: I refer
to Industry and Humanity by W. L. Mackenzie King. If we read and digested the
principles laid down in that book, we could
readily not only solve our national problems,
but also remove some of the obstacles that
impede international trade.
Honourable senators, before closing I should
like to express my regrets at the absence from
the chamber of the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and to extend to
him my sympathy in the death of Mrs. Haig.
I hope that he will soon recover from the
recent accident he suffered, and that he will
return to take his place in this chamber after
the Christmas recess.
May I add that we are indebted to the
acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). In the past he has been required
to devote much time to the work of the
Divorce Committee, but now that he is free
to turn his attention to other things I hope
he will give us the full benefit of his wealth
of knowledge and experience. We are always
pleased to hear from him, and also from his
colleague the honourable gentleman from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner); for while
there may be no crowding among the Conservative party members in this chamber,
individually they are strong.
To the honourable Leader of the Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) I
wish to express our great pleasure in his
appointment. He brings with him a vast
knowledge not only of parliamentary procedure, but of public affairs generally. I
would ask him to inform the government that
we in the Senate are ready to expedite the
business of parliament to the fullest extent;
but also to warn the government that we
reserve our right under the constitution to
review all legislation, and to reject and amend
according to the dictates of our conscience.

SENATE

I should also like to remind the honourable
leader that the government has a responsibility to maintain the Senate at its full
complement of 102 members. I know that
there has been difficulty at times in making
a satisfactory selection of candidates to fill
vacancies in this chamber, but in my opinion
vacancies should not remain unfilled for as
long as five or six years. If the government
met its responsibility in this regard, the
Senate would I think have proportionately
as many new members this session as has
the House of Commons.
To you, Mr. Speaker, may I say on behalf
of those of us who have been associated with
you for some years, how grateful we are that
you have attained the most distinguished
position parliament can offer, that of Speaker
of the Senate. To me it is a great pleasure
that you have succeeded to that position. I
know that you will control this body with
liberality, but with good judgment: that you
will let us go our own way sometimes, but,
not too far.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, for Hon.
Mrs. Wilson, the debate was adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
VICTORIAN ORDER OF NURSESSECOND READING

commission was the Honourable Mr. Justice
Colin Gibson of the Supreme Court of
Ontario.
This commission presented a report to the
last annual meeting of the order in May,
1953, recommending that the order should
apply to the Parliament of Canada for the
passing of an act re-incorporating it. Acts
of incorporation have been secured from parliament during recent years by the Red Cross,
the Canadian Legion and other organizations
of a somewhat similar type.
The bill as presented to parliament, in addition to certain general powers usually
granted to non-profit organizations of a
charitable nature, contains provisions respecting the corporate structure and organization
of the order, defining its powers and objects
and the qualifications of members and governors and providing for their election or, in
certain cases, their appointment. It also contains provisions to set up within the order
a Council of Nurses, which has not previously
existed.
The order presently carries on a visiting
nursing service in approximately 115 different communities throughout Canada.
It is hoped and expected that if parliament
grants a new charter the status of the order
will be enhanced and that this will be an
incentive to its continued growth and the
establishing of additional branches in communities where there is a need for its services and where it does not now operate.
I would like, at this time, to say a few
words about the major role the Victorian
Order of Nurses is playing in helping to
relieve over-crowded conditions in Canadian
hospitals located from Newfoundland to the
Pacific coast. The order in 1952 had 112
branches, and the strength of its nursing
staff was 500. This enabled it to provide
home nursing services in a number of new
areas, particularly in Newfoundland.
V.O.N. nurses make nearly one million
visits throughout the year to the homes of
Canadians in all walks of life. A total of
some 130,000 patients are cared for annually,
53 per cent of them mothers and babies.
Medical and surgical cases account for 40 per
cent of the patients, while the remainder of
the patients are persons requiring health
supervision. Many of these patients would
have taken up hospital space if the nursing
services of the order had not been available
to them.
Of the million annual visits, about 26 per

SENATE
Honourable senators, I should like to
express the hope that the honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), fully
restored to good health, will soon return to
his place as Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate. Shortly after the grievous loss of
his wife, he himself suffered an accident
which almost took his life. A stay of some
weeks in hospital must have been considerably irksome to one of his active temperament.
I am sure our women senators are gratified
that a women's bureau will be established in
the Department of Labour. In looking over
the qualifications required of the person to
head that bureau I came to the conclusion
that she will have to be a paragon; indeed,
I wonder if such an individual could be
found. The Liberal party convention of 1948,
which selected the present Prime Minister
to head our party, passed resolutions recommending that a woman be appointed to the
Civil Service Commission and also to the
Unemployment Insurance Commission. In
view of the large number of women employed
in the Civil Service and under the supervision
of the Unemployment Insurance Commission,
it would seem only proper that a specially
qualified woman should be appointed to each
of these posts. I notice that in the brief
they presented to the Prime Minister and
the cabinet last week the National Council
of Women urged the appointment of a woman
to the Civil Service Commission.
I should like to express disappointment in
the announcement that our postal rates are
to be raised next April. Although our air
mail service is a decided advantage to people
living in remote areas of Canada, it is far
from being an advantage to those in some
other parts.
At St. Andrews. New Brunswick, two or
three years ago I wondered why second-class
mail for Ottawa always arrived in less than
twenty-four hours, whereas letters, first-class
mail, took forty-eight hours and sometimes
even as long as seventy-two hours. I discovered that letters were being sent by air by
a route which necessitated a direct re-routing.
I do not know if the new plan to send all
first-class mail by air will improve postal
service in Canada as a whole.
I was highly gratified by and enjoyed tremendously the experience of representing
Canada at the Fourth General Assembly of the
United Nations in 1949. There I was, with
a good many of the other women delegates,
appointed to Committee Three, which dealt
with social and humanitarian questions and
to which the specialized agencies of the United
Nations report. I fear that many of us know
all too little of the work carried on by the

specialized agencies.
The World Health
Organization alone, by measures adopted, has
saved far more lives than were lost in the
two world wars. I was more directly concerned with the work of the International
Refugee Organization and was exceedingly
sorry that at that session of the United
Nations it was decided to cease its activities
and to appoint an international commissioner
for refugees under the auspices of the United
Nations. This international comissioner has
never had a satisfactory budget and has constantly been harrassed by seeing the need and
being unable to place people properly.
There, too, we heard of the work of the
U.N.I.C.E.F., that is, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, and it
was exceedingly gratifying to know that its
work would be carried on not primarily as
an emergency problem but with a view to
more permanent policy for the betterment of
children's health and well-being in underdeveloped countries. This organization has
done marvellous work, and it is only to be
hoped that its budget will bo sufficient to
carry on the work in the years to come.
One point upon which there was unanimity
in that committee was United Nations
scholarships. Under the United Nations they
are helping students, and graduate students
are brought to Canada and the United States
from the under-developed countries to study
our methods of forestry and many other subjects, so that they can go back and teach
their own people. We also can profit from
being sent to other parts of the world to
learn. Our own Dr. Keenleyside heads the
technical assistance program under the
United Nations. I am speaking from memory,
but recently I heard him on the radio tell
of the tremendous demand for technicial
assistance from many countries in all parts
of the world. He said that last year they
had only been able to carry out one-quarter
of the projects for which they had been
asked and for which they felt there was a
real need. They do not undertake a project
unless the country which is to benefit makes
application for it and promises all the assistance within its power. He said that with
the funds at present available they would
be able to carry out possibly only one project
in ten in the coming year. I was gratified to
learn this morning from Mr. Cavell, the
superintendent of the Colombo program, that
the outlook was better and that because they
had at least 70 applications from technicians
who were willing to go out to these other
countries they would be able to carry out
undertakings to a much greater extent than
Dr. Keenleyside had thought would be
possible. The difficulty had been the scarcity
of dollars to pay the technicians, who are

DECEMBER 14, 1953
available principally in Canada and the
United States, and therefore must be paid in
dollars.
We have heard much about the shortage
of food in certain under-nourished countries,
and I do hope that in some way our surplus
wheat can be used for the benefit of people
who are really in need. We can point to
Greece as a shining example, for Canada
came promptly to its aid and has secured
support for al the democratic programs there
since. Canada saved Greece from falling a
victim to the enticing doctrines of communism. As Confucius well said, "An empty
stomach does not dwell on high principles."
Undoubtedly the greatest power in Asia is the
people. Many countries have now acquired a
measure of self government, and unless we
help them along that road to independence
and a better way of living it will not be surprising if they succumb to the lure of the
doctrines so enticingly presented to them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Ray Petten: Honourable senators, I
should like at the outset to add my congratulations to al that have been offered in
this chamber during the last two weeks to
Mr. Speaker on his appointment as our
presiding officer. I am sure ail honourable
members agree with me that it is a fitting
recognition of the service he has given as
leader in this house, and that his tenure as
Speaker will be notably successful. We al
hope that abiding good health wil permit
him to enjoy to the full this crowning
achievement of a lifetime devoted to public
service.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pefen: I should like also to say
how much I welcome our new leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). Though he is a new member
of this chamber, he is certainly no novice,
and common report has it that, in another
place, he presided with a distinction which
I think we now feel confident he will give
to his new task.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Petten: May I also, if it be not
regarded as a presumption on my part-for
I am a fairly new member myself-extend a
sincere welcome to the new members of the
Senate and assure them that here they will
find, as I have found, an atmosphere of good
will and friendliness, and an underlying
determination on the part of everyone to
further the interests of our great nation.
Particularly, I should like to join with other
honourable senators in the words of welcome
they have expressed to the new lady members of this bouse, two of whom opened this
present debate in a manner worthy of the
best traditions of parliament.

And I am sure that, as a Newfoundlander,
I will be pardoned for saying a special word
of welcome to my old friend, the honourable
senator from Bonavista-Twillingate (Hon.
Mr. Bradley). The honourable gentleman
came to us from another place, where he
was the outstanding member from our province during the past four years, as well as
being the first minister from that province
in the government of Canada. But those four
years in this parliament were only a small
part of the honourable gentleman's career as
a parliamentarian. We in Newfoundland will
never forget that his was the last voice raised
in defence of representative institutions at
the time when they were temporarily extinguished in our province, and it was fitting
that his should have been the first voice
raised in the parliament of Canada as the
representative of the people of Newfoundland.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Petien: Honourable senators, one
of the advantages of being a member of this
house is that for a space of time-all too
short, perhaps, in some cases-one bas the
companionship of, the intimacy and the great
privilege of association with, some of the
best minds that this country has produced.
When you add to that the unfailing courtesy
and gracious friendliness of men like the late
Honourable. John Caswell Davis, and the late
Honourable Danny MacLennan, as he was so
affectionately known, both of whom have so
recently left us, then the honour of being
a member of this chamber becomes immeasurably enhanced. We who knew and loved
them miss them very much indeed.
I miss very much also the honourable the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) from
his accustomed place. This chamber is not
the same without his brilliant, witty comments, his outstanding philosophy and truly
remarkable grasp of current affairs. I do
hope he may soon return to us and long
remain.
I should like to congratulate the honourable the acting Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on the very able manner
in which he has performed his added duties:
duties not as onerous, perhaps, as those to
which he bas become accustomed for many
years as chairman of our busiest committee,
but certainly much more diversified.
Honourable senators, I have listened in
this chamber to much talk by distinguished
senators of the desirability, nay the absolutely necessity, of national unity of al races
and creeds if Canada is to continue on that
path of greatness which seems to be her
manifest destiny. I have preached that doctrine at every available opportunity both
here and in my own province. Down through

SENATE
the centuries Newfoundlanders have shown
an intense loyalty to what they regard as
the Mother Country, a loyalty which has
been demonstrated on many a hard-fought
field, through many a desperate engagement,
both on land and sea, from the shores of
Quebec when they helped repel Benedict
Arnold's invasion from the south in 1776, to
Flanders Fields where the old Royal Newfoundland Regiment earned the commendation from the Supreme Commander, of
"better than the best", and our naval contingent the great Churchill's compliment of
the "best small boatmen in the world".
With all their long proud history, they now
wish to be proud of their new country, the
greater Canada. This broad Canadian outlook, which the Newfoundland people have
already acquired, was clearly indicated in
the welcome they extended in the historic
events of last August to the new Secretary
of State of Canada. By the accident of birth
the Minister was not a Newfoundlander, but
the Newfoundland people by an overwhelming majority have made hin one by adoption.
They have welcomed him as a distinguished
public servant, already a national figure, who
could most ably represent them in the federal
cabinet, and I have no doubt that the judgment of the Newfoundland people will be
confirmed by events.
I think it would be a mistake, however,
for the people in the rest of Canada to feel
that, from now on, there is no need for any
special consideration of the needs of our
province. In less than five years we have
not yet reached the point where we can take
our Canadian status entirely for granted, or
where it is yet time for the rest of Canada
to take us entirely for granted.
It is generally recognized that Newfoundland felt the effects of the depression of the
30's with even greater severity than the rest
of Canada, and that the very frugal administration of the Commission of Government
left us far behind any other part of Canada
in the provision of those services and
amenities which are now accepted as normal
and almost as the rights of Canadians elsewhere. It is true that immense progress has
been made in the provision of services and
the development of amenities in the past
four and a half years. Both the Department
of Transport and the Canadian National Railways have done a great deal to improve
transport and communications, both of which
are especially necessary in those provinces
which are on the extremities of our country,
in the far east and the far west, and I feel
sure that my colleagues in this chamber from
British Columbia will have a special sympathy
for our situation.
We are particularly pleased at the .progress
which has been made with the new car ferry

to operate from North Sydney to Port aux
Basques. This was launched only last week,
and we hope and believe that what has
already been done is an earnest hope of what
is to come and that, by the time the 23rd
parliament has been elected, Newfoundland
will really have caught up with the rest of
Canada in transportation facilities.
We have been glad to see the development
in the postal service, particularly the delivery
of mail by air in the winter months. Our
experience with the Post Office Department
is that most of the officials are anxious to
continue to improve the service just as
rapidly as they can.
In this connection, there is one suggestion
I would like to make. In most other parts
of Canada, post offices in small places are
generally in rented premises. In the smaller
settlements of Newfoundland it is only very
rarely that suitable premises can be found
to rent, and the tradition in Newfoundland
was to have as post office buildings very
modest buildings, many of which are wearing
out, and many more of which are totally
inadequate to look after the vastly increased
volume of mail. I would hope that the government and the Post Office Department
would be able to take account of this special
situation in Newfoundland and provide for
the replacement of many of these buildings
just as rapidly as possible.
I may say that we are greatly encouraged
in Newfoundland by the visit recently of the
new Minister of Public Works to the province. The Minister of Public Works knows
the Atlantic coast and knows the problems
of the people there as well as does any
member of this parliament. His family has
had a long association with Newfoundland,
and we are very hopeful that he will carry
on that family tradition of close association
with our province. He will find there plenty
of scope for his abilities in his official
capacity.
But our greatest expectation, so far as
the federal government is concerned, is for
a steadily expanding federal activity in
the development and modernization of the
fisheries. We have been greatly encouraged
by certain developments which have taken
place in the past few months, and by the
evidence in the Speech from the Throne
that the federal government intends to continue to expand and to accelerate its part
in fisheries development.
I know that the new Minister of Fisheries
really wants to do a good job for Newfoundland, and I am rather glad that, by temperament, he himself is somewhat impatient,
because I am sure that will help him to
understand and to sympathize with the
impatience which some of us may show at
what is being accomplished.

DECEMBER 14, 1953
But the real key to fisheries development,
it seems to me, honourable senators-and this
also is indicated in the Speech from the
Throne-is the maintenance and expansion
of markets on which we can reasonably hope
to rely. If we can have suitable markets at
reasonably remunerative prices, I am one of
those who believe that private capital will
be forthcoming to take advantage of those
markets, and that the processing plants and
distribution services we will need will, in
fact, be forthcoming.
I have been particularly pleased by the
great personal interest the Minister of Trade
and Commerce has taken in our marketing
problem. We in Newfoundland, like other
Canadians, admire the minister for his
energy, his know-how, and his capacity to
get results, and we are glad to know that one
of his ablest and most trusted officials has
been entrusted with the chairmanship of a
committee to study the future of the markets;
and I can assure all honourable senators that
we in Newfoundland will look forward with
the keenest interest to the outcome of the
endeavours of this committee.
We have brought to Confederation a third
of a million consumers, who have added substantially to the domestic market for Canadian producers, and I am sure Canadians
in every province would be astonished at the
increase in the past four years in the volume
of sales in Newfoundland, of goods produced
in other provinces.
We also have, in the two great paper mills
at Grand Falls and Corner Brook, in the iron
mines of Bell Island, in the mines at Buchans
and on the West Coast, flourishing industries
which are making a substantial contribution
to the total national production of Canada,
and, through these corporations and their
employees, making substantial contributions
to the income of the Canadian government.
Many of us believe that, both in Newfoundland itself and in Labrador, we are
probably on the threshold of important
mineral developments; and with this object
in view some of the largest mining concerns
in the world are now carrying out explorations on the island and in Labrador. The
findings are extremely encouraging.
It is my own conviction that the completion
of the Trans-Island road will give a real
stimulus to the development not merely of
the tourist traffle but of all kinds of secondary
industrial and commercial activities, no doubt
many of them small in themselves, but
adding up, in the aggregate, to something
pretty substantial.
As time goes on, I believe Newfoundland
will become an increasingly fruitful source
of recruits for the armed forces of our country. My attention has been drawn to the

fact that the oldest regiment in Canada, dating back to 1775, is at present without an
armoury or any place with adequate facilities
for training. As honourable senators well
know, to receive and obtain full value for
military training, it is not only necessary to
have enthusiastic personnel on unit strength,
but also most necessary to obtain in full
measure complete support from the community, and at the same time to maintain esprit
de corps, pride in regiment and constant reference and reminder of regimental history.
This state of affairs can only be accomplished by the provision of adequate accommodation-some place which the regiment
can lay claim to as being its home; a place
not only where training is carried out, but
which makes possible the display of regimental properties, a constant reminder of its
glorious and gallant history. In addition, it
should be a place which the community can
visit or use under certain conditions, a practice which again lends support to regimental
recruiting and training.
The city of St. John's is probably the only
capital city in Canada without an armoury,
apart from the fact that it is the home of the
Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the 166th
Regiment of Field Artillery, the 56th Independent Field Squadron RCE (RF), No. 112
Manning Depot together with four army cadet
corps. In this connection we welcome the
past interest, and bespeak the continuing
interest, of the Minister of National Defence
in the development of facilities for the training of the reserve forces in our province.
Finally, honourable senators, I am confident that if we all do our part to understand
one another the people of the rest of Canada
will, as the years go on, become increasingly
proud of our province, which is at once the
oldest and the youngest member of the Canadian family.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Duffus: Honourable senators, in
giving consideration to the debate on the
Address in reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech from the Throne at
the opening of this the twenty-second parliament, I seek the indulgence of the house to
make a few brief observations.
I feel assured that all honourable members
of the Senate will be happy, and at the same
time deeply concerned, with respect to the
current royal visit of Her gracious Majesty
Queen Elizabeth and her distinguished husband the Duke of Edinburgh, who have embarked on a commonwealth tour covering
some 50,000 miles and extending over a period
of six months. I venture to say, that beyond

SENATE
doubt they will be received with joyous enthusiasm wherever they go, and that their
visit will increase the loyal sentiments and
good will of all Her Majesty's subjects. I
have used the word "concerned": but we
trust that God in His infinite wisdom may
guide and protect them to their journey's end,
where they will be happily united with their
children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.
It is with deep respect that we offer to His
Honour the Speaker our warmest congratulations and our very best wishes for success
in the administration of his exacting duties.
Most of us here have enjoyed a cordial association with him during his eight-year tenure
as Leader of the Senate. His dignity, kindly
attitude, cheerfulness and inspiring confidence
were a source of pleasure and pride to us at
all times. I join honourable members in expressing the sincere hope that he and his
charming wife may long enjoy health and
happiness together.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear
Hon. Mr. Duffus: I humbly tender a warm
welcome and sincere congratulations to the
affable and capable leader of the Senate,
the honourable member from Brantford (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald).
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: It was my pleasure to
have served with him in the other place, where
he was popular with all members. After long
and faithful service he was appointed Deputy
Speaker and, subsequently, Speaker of the
House. There he served with singular distinction and dignity: he was kind, courteous,
and impartial in his decisions. He comes to
this chamber with a very enviable record
of devotion to duty. I venture to predict that
he will emulate the best traditions of the
long line of illustrious leaders who have preceded him. Coming from the banner province
of Ontario; possessing, as he does, so many
fine qualities of heart and mind; his legal
training and his long experience at the Bar
and in public life also give the assurance that
in him we have a capable leader and minister.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: It is my conviction that
all honourable senators will unite in wishing
our honourable leader and his gracious wife
good health, and happiness together for many
years.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: It is now a very great
pleasure for me to extend cordial felicitations
to the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon.
Mrs. Jodoin), who so eloquently presented
the motion for the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. Her charm and

culture, characteristic of her race and her
native province, will enhance the dignity and
prestige of this chamber. We confidently
hope that she, in turn, will derive much
pleasure and satisfaction from her association
with the varying responsibilities which devolve upon this house from time to time.
I would also extend a special welcome to
our honourable colleague from one of the
Atlantic provinces, the member from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson). We offer her
congratulations not only as a senator but
as a distinguished member of the Bar. From
her contribution to the debate we know she
will be most helpful as a legal adviser in
the deliberations of our committees, and I
am sure her assistance will be valued by
us all.
One of the most important items mentioned in the Speech from the Throne was
that of our responsibility to increase the
strength of our defence forces. Although
there is now a truce in Korea, all will
agree that it is wise to maintain our forces
and equipment there, because hostilities may
be resumed on very short notice. In fact,
world conditions are such that nearly all the
free nations have found it advisable to build
up their military, economic and moral
strength.
We must not overlook for a
moment the possibility of long-range bombing
attacks upon what may prove to be the
arsenal of democracy in North America.
With this threat overhanging us, the defence
of this hemisphere, particularly in the Canadian section, is largely a matter of strengthening the air force, and this is a very costly
business. The equipment alone is appallingly expensive; but we Canadians, like our
neighbours, are fortunate in having a high
national and individual income. Both countries also possess the kind of production facilities which invest them with major importance
from the defence point of view, and we would
be unwise not to take advantage of the fact.
The air force, part of which has a specially
important role to play, is based at North Bay,
in Ontario. It is being built up in the
closest kind of working co-operation with
the United States. That co-operation consists
in the first place of a ring of radar stations
designed to give us the earliest possible intelligence of enemy attack. The radar works
on somewhat the same principle as television,
although it is rather a line of sight; and
although the range is limited, it is being
rapidly extended farther and farther afield.
Beyond North Bay are radar stations which
operate around the clock and pick up on the
radar screens any aircraft within their areas.
Even though an aircraft is identified, through
the flight plan or otherwise, as friendly, it

DECEMBER 14, 1953
must be watched. This is done through sending out from the radar station transmitter
the fan or vein, a pulse which goes out on
line of sight and, when it strikes an object
-be it the ground, a ship, or an airplanecomes back in the form of a wave which is
visible on the radar screen. The identification
of these signals requires highly-skilled operators. Their training and equipment enable
them to transmit at once the information they
pick up to fighter control stations, where it
is sorted and followed up. Then, if necessary,
it will be sent out over the air by operation of
other radar sets, and thus contact can be
established with an enemy even though that
enemy cannot then be seen.
We have the kind of facilities to carry out
this operation, and to protect the more settled
parts of Canada and the United States. This
requires setting up radar stations and establishing systems of communication by wire,
wireless or micro waves. Then the plan
requires the backing of interceptor aircraft
that can take to the air with a minimum of
delay and fly with sufficient speed to engage
the enemy before he strikes at our vital
sources of power and strength. This is a
complicated operation which requires the
highest degree of team work, and also very
expensive equipment for radar, communications and aircraft. North Bay was selected as
one of the principal fighter stations in the
operation because it is geographically suited
to protect the industrial centres of Canada
and the United States against a certain line
of attack.
Honourable senators, I feel I can say with
little fear of contradiction that our military
technicians and fighting men and women of
the Canadian navy, army and air force are
advancing in skill, gallantry and determination and are endowed with a dynamic spirit.
Our country, with a population of fewer than
15 million people, bas a fighting force of
some 110,000 personnel all told. Mark you,
Canada's army is the only volunteer army
in the world, and it is justly admired by all
nations. Side by side with nations mourning
for their dead, and side by side with Silver
Cross mothers, our boys and girls are ever
ready to do their full part, whenever and
wherever necessity demands. Truly theirs
is a proud record.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: No doubt all honourable
members noticed in the press of November
30 the list of atrocities perpetrated by the
Reds in Korea. According to the press reports
the communists had murdered 29,815 soldiers
and civilians, most of the soldiers being from
the United States.

Honourable senators, it is with some diffidence but without egoism or any personal
feeling of satisfaction, apparent or implied,
that I say to this house that the death of
Stalin removed from the world an evil man.
But this evil that he helped so much to
strengthen and spread did not die with
him, for there are others who are quite
capable and well equipped to carry on his
work. Despite the hysterical adulation of his
followers, Stalin was a non-compromising
communist. He was a living symbol., and
communistic propaganda will strive to make
the same sort of symbol of his successor.
What too many of us fail to understand is
that the men who get to the top in communism must of necessity, judging from the
cruelty that has existed in communistic
activities, be brutal, ruthless and evil. Communism is the sort of system which not only
breeds such men, but must be controlled by
them. It is a system which destroys the
morals and the mind, and places a premium
on cunning and savagery. We can only expect
Malenkov and his colleagues to be more or
less savage and cunning, as Stalin was. If
the Russians decide to be more approachable and more friendly it will be because
they see more advantage for the Soviet in
taking such a course, and not because they are
impelled by any deep regard for humanity.
Just because Stalin is dead we have no reason whatever to believe that the communists
will abandon their cherished doctrine that
they must govern the world, nor must we
believe that they will give up their plans
to make that doctrine a reality.
We should be glad that we have not had a
minority parliament in Canada during the
past trying years, but that our parliament
has had sufficient foresight, strength and
morale to see to it that Canada does its part
as a member of the United Nations in combating any alien cause or enemy. Why do I
stress this? It is for the very good and
obvious reason that, as honourable senators
are aware, whether we like it or not communism is spreading and communistic aggression is increasingly our most wicked and
ruthless enemy. Communism is an organization which symbolizes blood and death, and I
caution honourable members of its inevitable
consequences. Does anyone here disbelieve
me? Listen to these words of the present
leader of Russia, delivered before he became
premier, in a major policy declaration in
Moscow on November 19, 1949:
If there is another blood bath, there will
weeping mothers in America.

be

Would that not affect all of us: our families,
our homes and all we possess?
"Man's
inhumanity to man makes countless thousands

SENATE
mourn." Surely, we should have no faith or
confidence in such a man or in such a nation.
In my humble opinion, Canada and indeed all
the free nations of the world should continue
effectively to build up and strengthen their
fighting forces sufficiently to cope with whatever occasion demands.
"Self preservation is the first law of
nature." And, if I may quote again:
To thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

I now come to Canada-our country, this
great nation. Canada is great because it is
dedicated to a great ideal and a great principle; she is great because there has been
built around her a truly Christian concept of
society. What a contrast. No one would
suggest that our way of life is perfect, but no
one can deny that, year by year, in correcting
our shortcomings we have been successful
in meeting the terms of economic and social
justice.
I would be remiss if I did not remind the
house of the Veterans Charter of 1946. That
charter is the finest expression in the world
of a nation's gratitude to those who so
unselfishly served, and it was our privilege,
and duty to the pioneer past to grant it, since
we have so great a heritage and so adventurous a future.
In closing, may I say that Canada has
today a great challenge to meet, and a great
responsibility to shoulder. May our beloved
country, under God's guidance, grow in
stature, health, strength, stability, happiness
and prosperity; may she be successful in
bringing every benefit to all her people from
sea to sea-this Canada, our home, our native
land, and, in so many instances, we are proud
to say, the land of our adoption. What a
thrill of pride goes through our beings
when we realize the full significance of these
words: Canada, this beautiful, bountiful land,
stretching from ocean to ocean and ranking
high among the great nations of the world!
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pratt, the debate

DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN AFFAIRS
AND NATIONAL RESOURCES BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

On the order for the second reading of Bill 6, an Act respecting the Department of Northern Affairs and National
Resources.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
Leader of the Government, or the Leader of
the Senate in the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has asked meHon. Mr. Lambert: Move the second
reading.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A question has been
raised, Mr. Speaker, whether I should speak
first and move the second reading of the bill
afterwards, or move the second reading
before I begin to speak.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Move it first.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think that the
practice of making the motion first is hallowed by tradition and experience, and that
the other is in accordance with the book of
rules, which says that an honourable senator
shall speak first and move afterwards. Certainly, as long as I have been here the
general practice has always been to move
the reading of the bill first and to speak
afterwards. If I had to rule, I should have
to abide by the book, which directs that an
honourable senator shall speak first and move
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Honourable senators, now I can start all
over again. It might be useful and interesting to members of the house if a short historical survey were given of the development
of the part of Canada to which this bill is
directed.
In the year 1670, Charles the Second,
sometimes known as "The merry monarch",
granted a charter to a company of gentlemen,
at whose head was Prince Rupert. The
charter gave very extensive privileges to
this new company, which was called "The
Company of Adventurers of England trading
into Hudson's Bay", and later came to be
known as the Hudson's Bay Company. When
the King granted the charter he was in a
very generous mood; he was under an obligation to Prince Rupert, because in the parliamentary wars twenty-five years earlier
Rupert had been one of the great leaders
on the side of the King, who was his father.
The charter embraced all the lands-all the
area whose waters drained even from remote
regions into Hudson's Bay. That will give
an idea of the dimension of the empire given
to these gentlemen adventurers. In 1870, two
hundred years later, and three years after the
confederation of the Canadian colonies, this
whole area was ceded by the Hudson's Bay
Company to Canada for a cash consideration
and then became part of the great public
domain of our country. It will be borne in

DECEMBER 14, 1953
mind that before the area was ceded to
Canada the administration of law was in the
hands of the Hudson's Bay Company.
The province of Manitoba was formed in
1870. The next big event that touched this
huge area was the development of the Yukon
in the closing years of the last century. Gold
was discovered in the creeks adjacent to
what later became Dawson City, and the
great gold rush started to that area. In 1898,
in order to have more effective supervision
of this particular area, a division was made
of this vast area just mentioned and the
Yukon territory was set up as an administrative unit.
Then in 1905 two additional provinces
were created in western Canada: Saskatchewan and Alberta. Saskatchewan on its
eastern border was adjacent to Manitoba,
and Alberta on its western border was
adjacent to British Columbia.
In 1912 the boundaries of these three
provinces were extended northward to the
60th parallel of latitude and since then that
part of the area has been under the respective
jurisdictions of these three provinces. In 1930
the final act of the transfer of the natural
resources within the provincial areas was
accomplished and to all intents and purposes
these western provinces now occupy precisely the same position as the original provinces that entered Confederation in 1867, so
far as their natural resources are concerned.
In 1936, when the Liberal administration
under the late Mackenzie King came into
office it decided to amalgamate certain governmental activities and two departments of
government, one being Interior and Immigration-Interior still had to do with the
Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories-and the other department being concerned with mines and Indian affairs. Both
were united into one department under the
title of Mines and Resources, and it was that
department which your humble servant had
the duty of presiding over for a period of
ten years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In 1949 it was thought
desirable, I suppose because of the increasing
complexity of government and the everwidening sphere of government, that a division should be made. And so, out of the
Department of Mines and Resources there
was created, first, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration; second, the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys; and
third, the Department of Resources and
Development.
The Department of Resources and Development had to do with the Yukon Territory

and all the area north of the northern provincial boundaries and also with the national
parks, historic monuments and the like. Now
a further change is being brought about by
this bill. The Department of Resources and
Development will, after the passing of this
legislation, pass out of existence, and the
department will henceforth be known as the
Department of Northern Affairs and National
Resources. That is a brief historical sketch
of the developments since 1870.
May I now say a word about the character
of this area lying north of the provinces. It
extends from Baffin Land on the east to
Alaska on the west. Over the greater eastern
part, from the coast of Labrador, dipping
down into the central provinces, going northwesterly through Ontario, Manitoba and
northern Saskatchewan and up to the Arctic
Circle, is an area that is known as the preCambrian, or Great Northern shield. The
pre-Cambrian shield is composed of the oldest
rocks known to geologists, or at any rate so
I have been told.
Over on the western side is a great mass
of mountains referred to as the Rocky Mountains. There are really three distinct ranges,
and in combination they are known as the
Cordilleras. Those mountains continue north
to the northern boundary of British Columbia;
and again, curiously, there is then a dipthat is the best word to describe it, I believe
-and it is through that sort of pass that the
Alaska highway was built and over which lies
the main air route from Edmonton to the far
northwest. North of this there is another
mountain range, known as the Mackenzie
Mountains, extending north to the Arctic
plain.
During the course of my responsibility as
a minister of the department, I had occasion
to travel over a good deal of this territory
and it was very interesting. I should add
before I deal with this that in between the
pre-Cambrian shield and the great mass of
the Rocky Mountains lies the great plains
which widen out at the southern part of Canada from Winnipeg to Calgary and beyond
and then extend north, forming the basin of
the Mackenzie River. This whole area has a
slowly growing population, as I shall
presently indicate. Its resources are commencing now to be developed, and they show
great promise.
Dawson was once a city: in 1901, by a
census count, it had a population of approximately 27,000. That of course was the result
of the gold rush of 1898-99, when some very
large individual fortunes were made from
panning gravel for gold. I visited it in 1942,
and found it completely a ghost town. I

SENATE
slept one night in a hotel called the
"Floradora", which was a famous name fifty
years ago. The buildings in this place that
once had been a city of 27,000 people and
now has only a few hundred souls, have
fallen into ruin and decay.
While there I visited the old Government
House. As honourable senators may recall,
in the days of the gold rush there was little
communication between this gold camp and
the outside world: there was no telegraph
or radio service, and mails were very
irregular because they came by way of the
Yukon River from Whitehorse to Dawson
city. Consequently, considerable authority
had to be given to government officers and
police authorities in order to maintain law
and order in this mining camp of some
20,000-odd people; therefore quite a substantial government house was built-partially, I
suppose, to impress the inhabitants of the
place. The last occupant of Government
House was the Honourable George Black,
who was at one time a member of the House
of Commons and, for a few years, Speaker
of that house. He gave up his governorship
and occupation of Government House in 1916
to raise a battalion, which he took overseas.
It was decided at the time that a successor to
Mr. Black would not be appointed, and so the
building was closed; and it remained closed
until only a few years ago.
I found this old building surrounded by a
picket fence that was falling down; in the
front yard where once haýd been a lovely
lawn, there now were trees twenty feet
high. I got into the rear of the building and
there saw everything just as it had been left
twenty-seven years earlier: the dishes and
cutlery on the table, the stoves in the kitchen,
the carpets on the floor, the bookcases filled
with books, the piano in the drawing-room,
and everything else just as it was when the
last governor had walked out in 1916.
The question has been asked why some
disposition was not made of the furnishings.
The answer is that nothing practical could
be done with them: any attempt at salvage
would cost more than the furnishings could
sell for. Consequently, they were left there.
I am informed that within the past four or
five years the building has been turned over
to an order of Sisters, who have converted
it into a hospital.
One who travels north -of Dawson crosses
the most rugged country, I imagine, in the
world. Our party were travelling by plane,
and I must say that nature was in a sportive
mood when she tossed up the Ogilvie Mountains. Having passed those mountains, we
flew on towards the Arctic, a distance of 250
to perhaps 300 miles over a level plain of
tundra country with brief patches of low

bush; thence easterly over the Richardson
Mountains to Aklavik, which is located at the
delta of the Mackenzie river some 140 miles
within the Arctic Circle.
To look at another part of the north
country, one who travels north of Churchill
up to the Arctic will see more tundra country, but still with the basic pre-Cambrian
shield. The astonishing thing is that the
pre-Cambrian shield, which is now known to
contain great mineral wealth, was by the
early geologists thought to be barren rock
so far as mineral wealth was concerned. And
it was not until the building of the Temiskaming Railway when, as a result of blasting
through rock a vein of native silver was
uncovered, geologists learned of the mineral
wealth in the pre-Cambrian shield. We know
now of the huge iron ore resources in the
Labrador, and of other mineral wealth
extending through the northern parts of
Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and on up to the
Arctic Circle.
Honourable senators, this area which I
have described in some detail will come
under the administration of the proposed
legislation. Perhaps, at this point, I should
comment on its economic status.
I have already mentioned that in 1901 the
Yukon Territory had a population of 27,000;
in 1951 it was 9,100. Of this number about
2,550 resided in the town of White Horse,
and of these about 1,500 were military personnel and their families. Included in the
total of 9,10,0 were approximately 1,500
Indians. In the area known as the Northwest
Territories, which is east of the Yukon Territory, the population estimated by the 1951
census was 16,000, of which 5,300 were
whites, 4,500 were Indians and some 6,200
were of the Eskimo race. There has been
a remarkable growth at White Horse, which
is situate at the southern end of the Yukon
Territory, at the point where the White Horse
Railway comes in from Skagway. It was the
passage of the Chilkoot Pass, over which this
railway runs, which some fifty-five years ago
posed the biggest problem to gold-seekers
during the inrush to the Yukon Territory.
In 1952 the production -of minerals in the
Yukon Territory amounted to $11,386,000, of
which a substantial portion came from the
operations of a dredging company which is
working over many of the old creeks with
large dredges and salvaging what gold is left.
I saw something of their operations when I
was in the district a number of years ago.
The balance of the mineral production in
this area comes mainly from the Mayo district, where several profitable mines are
being worked. Mayo is located a short distance-according to my recollection, about
150 miles-north and east of White Horse.

DECEMBER 14, 1953
In the Northwest Territories, exclusive of
radioactive ores, which in the past came
from the Eldorado mine, on Great Bear
lake, the total production last year amounted
to $8,944,000. It was derived from several
gold camps located on the northern shores
of Great Slave Lake, and now known as the
Yellowknife country. When I was at Aklavik
in the month of August, on the occasion
I have mentioned, I saw some oats and
barley which had been planted by a local
doctor to see how they would grow. Though
the results were not very impressive, the
grain had grown. But, the same day I saw
some beautiful flowers and excellent garden
produce. At that time the only means of
locomotion was to walk. I think I would have
paid $25 an hour for a taxi, because it was
a warm day and I had to cover a considerable
distance on official visits to the hospitals under
the respective auspices of the Roman Catholic
Church and the Anglican Church, and the
schools connected with them; and also, of
course, I had to see the cathedral.
The idea that this country is a harsh and
barren land every month in the year is all
wrong. On two occasions I have been to
Bear Lake. My first trip was early in September, and it was a disagreeably warm day
-a fact of which I have a very lively recollection.
The only other product of economie importance at the present time is furs. I have not
any recent figures relating to the Yukon, but
in 1951-52 fur production in the Northwest
Territories was of the order of a million and
a half dollars. As far as one can see, the
future development of that area will be
mainly in the exploitation of mineral
resources.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: What about the fish?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I said "mainly". I shall
refer to fish a little later. There are, however,
definite possibilities in respect of oil. Oil
was found many years ago at Norman Wells,
which is down the waterway approximately
1,400 miles from Edmonton.
The honourable acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) referred to
fish. The problem is to get them from where
they are to where they can be marketed.
However, very substantial quantities have
been taken out of Great Slave Lake since
a motor road was built several years ago
from Grimshaw, on the Northern Alberta
Railways, to the mouth of Hay River, where
it empties into Great Slave lake.
At this point I want to mention another
matter which I think is of some importance.
At times we hear fear or concern expressed
that the presence of our American friends

in the north country on defence business may
lead to some difficulties. I do not for a
moment share these apprehensions. We are
glad that United States detachments are in
the north country participating in measures of
defence. As the Prime Minister said during
the discussion of this bill in the other place,
Canada lies between Russia and the United
States, and to understand clearly what this
signifies one should refer not to an ordinary
map but to a globe. The defence of this
northern area is therefore a matter of as
great importance to the United States as it is
to Canada.
Canada's claim to this area in the north can
now be said to be effectively established.
According to international law there are, I
am advised, four ways of determining the
ownership of territory. The first is by exploration and discovery. That is not now
deemed to be conclusive. A country might
send an expedition to explore some area, as
was commonly done a few centuries ago, when
mariners were circumnavigating the world;
then the representative of some other nation
would come along and plant his country's flag
on the same ground, and at once a dispute
arose.
The next principle usually accepted is that
of contiguity, which means proximity to a
territory already occupied. According to the
most complete test available, that of effective
occupation, Canada unquestionably bas full
right to all the Arctic Archipelago as far
as the North Pole
There is another principle, known as the
sector principle, which deals with longitudes.
There are 360 degrees in the circumference
of the earth, and these parallels of longitude
are far apart at the equator but converge
at the North Pole. According to international
law, Canada bas a pretty valid claim to all
land lying within certain sectors right up to
the pole. Canada also has the advantage
of effective occupation, for she now bas
weather stations sending in regular reports
from the far north. One of these stations is
as far north as Ellesmere Land, which I
understand is only about 600 miles from the
pole. In addition, Canada also sends ships
into the far northern waters every summer.
At any rate, I do not think Canada's claim to
these northern regions will be disputed.
It might be worth mentioning that a few
years ago a civilian organization, known as
the Arctic Institute was set up in Montreal.
This institute, which is in no way sponsored
by the government, is carrying on active work
in collecting and classifying data about these
remote places. The purpose of this legislation is to give recognition to the growing
importance of the vast area in this north
country.

SENATE
Honourable senators, from reading this bill
I would say that practically all the powers
contained in it now exist in the legislation
which governs the Department of Resources
and Development. I think we should note, as
the Prime Minister himself pointed out
recently, that by changing the name to the
Department of Northern Affairs and National
Resources we emphasize the importance of
the northern country to Canada. The new
department will not need any additional staff,
for we are not setting up a new piece of
governmental machinery.
We are simply
changing the name of the department and
clarifying some of its powers. For instance,
section 5 of the bill provides that Eskimo
affairs will come under the department. The
Indian Act specifically excludes the Eskimo
from the administration of Indian Affairs.
Yet the courts have held that Eskimos are
Indians: I think this was decided in a ruling
handed down in 1939. Despite this ruling, the
Department of Resources and Development,
like the old Department of Mines and Resources, kept supervision over the Eskimo,
who received family allowance benefits and
so on. If an Eskimo committed a crime, the
R.C.M.P. were quick to investigate and bring
the culprit to justice. For many years the
department has been endeavouring to make
these people self-reliant.
It is interesting to note that there was some
discussion in the other house about the reindeer herd which is east of Aklavik. Reindeer
were originally brought into Alaska from
northern Europe. In 1929 Canada bought some
3,000 head in Alaska and in the following
three years they were herded around the
northern shores into the Aklavik delta. When
they arrived there were 2,370, by actual
count, but since that time the herd has
increased to 7,700. An interesting experiment was carried out when small individual
herds were given over to Eskimos who had
gained sufficient experience in herding reindeer for the government. If this practice is
further developed it may result in the Eskimo
becoming economically independent, for the
reindeer is an extraordinarily useful animal.
Honourable senators, section 5 of the bill
provides that the duties, powers and functions of the new department will extend to
the Northwest Territories and the Yukon
Territory, which constitutes the largest part
of this whole area; to Eskimo affairs; forest
and water resources of Canada that are not
under provincial jurisdiction; irrigation projects and water power developments; national

parks and historic places and monuments,
and so forth. Practically all these powers
exist within the present Department of
Resources and Development.
Honourable senators, I repeat that in the
main all we are doing is changing the name
of the department. The main purpose in
doing so is to put the emphasis on northern
development; the Government of Canada will
have a department for that purpose and
citizens will realize more and more that there
are important resources in this part of the
dominion.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before the honourable
senator sits down, I would like to ask him a
question. Can he tell me what it costs the
federal government to administer the Yukon
and the Northwest Territories, and what
revenue is received by the federal government from all sources in those areas?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I have not that information here, but it will be available when
the bill goes to committee, as I think it should.
I move the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
understand that the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), would like to
have this bill receive the second reading this
evening. Therefore, although the hour is
quite late, I will say what I have to say about
the bill now.
When I heard that the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was going
to explain the bill I knew we would be given
a very interesting explanation of it, for he
has had a great deal of experience in connection with mines and resources.
He
certainly has furnished us with much valuable information. However, he told me he
would take only 20 minutes to do so, and I
find that he exceeded his estimate by at least
a few minutes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He covered a lot of
territory. If I may interrupt the honourable
acting Leader of the Opposition, I would say
that we have not received certain bills from
the other place that were expected and for
that reason I would have no objection if my
honourable friend moved the adjournment of
the debate now.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

ADDRESS

IN REPLY

ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the open.ing of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mis. Jodoin for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
1 wish to avail myseif -of this opportunity to
comment on some matters referred. to in the
Speech from the Throne.
Before doing so, may I congratulate His
H1onour the Speaker on the eminence to which,
he has risen in this bouse. I arn sure he
carnies to that high office the confidence and
good will of this entire body.
This house is fortunate also in having as
Leader of the Government the honourable

giving particular attention ta the development
of markets for our fisheries and to the encouragement Of More modern methods in the Atlantic
coast fisherles, particularly in the province of
Newfoundland where the methods are ini the
greatest need of Improvement.

I wish to refer to that clause in the speech
particularly and also to aspects of Canada's
external trade. In that matter my province
is vitaily interested.
It is not; generally
realized that Newfoundland is more dependent on foreign trade and less favoured by
domestic trade, or I might caîl it interprovincial trade, than any other province
of Canada. Officially that tact is known,
but it does not; appear to motivate policy
to any great degree. Canadians generally
are not; aware of it, which is not to be
wondered at, but I think it is up ta ahl
Newfoundlanders ta put that fact across
as f orcibly as possible.
Newtoundland. needs special treatment in
the provision of fareign trading facilities. 1
can say it earns it, and I can say further
and most emphatically it pays for it. In
return, however, it gets only the bare fringe
of special consideratian in that respect.
Newfoundiand, I say, pays for special consideration in foreign trade. I know that
having made that statement I shouid not just
leave it there. 1 should tell you why, and
it is a pleasure for me to do so. Here are
some of the tacts. For every dollar we sehi
to the other provinces of aur production, we
buy at least fit teen dollars, if not twenty
dollars of their production. While exact'
figures are not available, it is a saf e estimate
that Newfoundland buys up around 150 million dollars' worth of goods, perhaps considerabhy more, tram the other provinces.
We seil iron ore to the Sydney mills in Nova
Scotia, and that's about ail. I arn not complaining on that score. The geography we

SENATE
cannot correct, and wouldn't if we could. The
other provinces produce at home practically
everything of a similar nature to what we
produce, and they are all nearer their natural
markets in this interprovincial trade.
There is quite a live issue in the matter
of freight rates to and from Newfoundland
which I haven't time to deal with today,
but I hope I may be able to do so in the near
future.
Naturally our people must produce to live.
They must produce from the sea, the forests
and the mines. They must sell the products
of their labour in the world's markets to get
the money to buy in Canada. What they
buy in the other provinces is not only manufactured goods, but a larger proportion of
agricultural products than one province
usually buys from another. The reason is
that

Newfoundland

is

not

so

blessed with richness of soil and appropriate
climate as are most other provinces.
As I was saying, Newfoundland's chief
products, which are of the sea, the forests
and the mines, have mostly to find a market
outside of Canada. In that respect we are
different from any other province. With all
the prominence that is given to the wheat
problem, for instance, I would point out
that there is a domestic trade within the
dominion for about 30 per cent of a good
crop. All the principal grain together, including wheat, have a domestic trade of
about 55 per cent. Vegetables, eggs, dairy
products and almost everything one can
think of, including goods manufactured on
the mainland, have their basic sale right in the
provinces of Canada, including the province
of Newfoundland. Anything done, therefore,
to facilitate foreign trade for Newfoundland
is no handout-it is financially and in every
other way done in the general interests of
Canada.
Newfoundland lives by exports to a degree
unknown to most areas of the world. We
think of the Dominion of Canada as one of
the greatest exporting countries of the world
-and so it is. Comparing the exports to the
gross national product, Newfoundland just
before union with Canada had a ratio of
exports three times greater than the Dominion
of Canada as a whole. It is about the same
today.
In the year before union, Newfoundland
with 370,000 people was fifth in importance
of the export markets of Canada. With the
greater switch of buying of manufactured and
all lines of goods to the other provinces since
then, the importance of Newfoundland trade
to Canada has increased immeasurably. This
is accounted for chiefly by the operation of
the Canadian tariff.

Two main factors enable Newfoundland to
make this great contribution to the industrial
life of the other provinces. First, it is our
production, as I say, of the sea, the forests
and the mines, which, in the sum total, must
nearly all be sold outside of Canada. Second,
it is the expenditures within Newfoundland
by the Americans in the maintenance and
extensions of their great bases. Other factors could be mentioned, of course, but they
are minor in comparison.
What I want to bring out in mentioning
these facts is just this: The economy of
Newfoundland is the development of generations off there by itself. Fundamentally it is
not a Canadian economy. Geography and
history have made it so.
By reason of these factors the province has a
unique problem in its foreign trade. It requires
special treatment; and as I said before, it
earns it and deserves it.
A saying that makes me thoroughly sick
is one that is heard so often, not only up
here but sometimes from people in high office
in our own province; it is: "Of course, this
or that can hardly be done for Newfoundland, because other provinces would demand
the same and it would be impracticable".
People who say this forget that not only
have we not grown up for the past eighty
years or so with the other provinces, but in
the matter of foreign trade facilities-and it
is that to which I am referring at the
moment-we turn over the benefits derived
from those facilities largely to the Canadian
industries in the other provinces.
I can well imagine a ready reply to this
being-"and so would be the effect in any
part of Canada of an extension of foreign
trade". I want to make this clear. To say
just that would be entirely wrong and missing the point of my whole argument.
I state again, the money brought in to
Newfoundland from exports abroad is used
to facilitate a one-way trade such as does
not occur between any of the other provinces
in the dominion. We buy the products of
the other provinces, who in turn buy practically nothing from us; and this, as I say
again, sets up an entirely unique situation
in the dominion of Canada.
The clause in the Speech from the Throne
from which I quoted refers to the development of markets for our fisheries and the
improvement of methods of production, particularly in the province of Newfoundland.
Marketing and production are, of course,
interlocking factors. Planning for production
is futile without planning for marketing.

DECEMBER 15. 1953
I would like to pay a tribute to the federal Department of Fisheries for its earnestness in approaching the problems. In the
matter of improvement of production that
department bas undoubtedly more scope and
authority within itself than in marketing.
The problems of marketing are tied in with
several departments of government.
The approach to the whole problem of
Newfoundland fisheries was studied by a
committee under the chairmanship of Sir
Albert Walsh, Chief Justice of Newfoundland.
Two years of strenuous work resulted in a
factual statement of great value. It deals
chiefly with long term development in the
field of production, but bas very little of
practical application or recommendation to
marketing problems.
The report points the way to greater production per man, which, if attained, would
repair a great weakness in our codfishing
industry. It is, of course, of that industry
that I wish to speak particularly, because
it is a far greater employer of labour than
any other. Really it is the low average production, coupled with the seasonal employment, which has made the earnings entirely
inadequate to modern needs.
The codfishery employs nearly all the
Newfoundlanders engaged in our fisheries.
The other fisheries are just supplemental to
it. That is a natural condition, because cod
is the most prolific of the fish in our waters
and it is the only product of the fisheries
which is not subject to any great fluctuation
of supply. This is a factor of tremendous
importance and value.
The codfishery falls within two branches:
the quick frozen product, and the salted
product.
Contrary to the opinion often expressed,
the Newfoundland fishing industry, which
bas taken a bad beating, has not taken it
lying down. The industry bas been revealing
the pioneering, gambling spirit which created
it and bas maintained it for over four
hundred years. Within the past eight or ten
years Newfoundland business firms, by
investment of their own capital, by borrowing from the government, the banks and the
public, and by plowing back earnings, have
invested between $15 million and $20 million
in cold storage and filleting plants, trawlers,
refrigeration vessels and equipment, and so
forth. It is questionable if one of those
plants has paid a dividend in that time. They
have earned money, but the earnings have
gone back into extensions and for working
capital, and some new plants are now under
construction.
I think it is as good an
example of enterprise as you will find
anywhere.

Al that type of production is dependent
on the American market, and will be for a
long time to come. How fickle that can be
for any article competing with American
production we ail know. Anyway, Newfoundlanders have had the courage to tackle
a progressive job in that field and take their
chances, because at least there are not any
currency difficulties which, in other fields,
is really a nightmare.
After that display of confidence to which
I refer, one may reasonably ask: Why is the
industry reported to be so depressed? The
trouble lies with the old-established branch,
the oldest export trade in North America,
the salted codfish industry. The number of
fishermen employed in that is many times
more than in the other branches of the
fishery. As a matter of fact, if the present
investment in the frozen fish industry were
increased several times over, the number of
fishermen engaged would be small in comparison with those who have been catching
codfish for salting.
The emphasis in my remarks on this subject, of such importance to our province, is
laid on the need for the stabilization of the
salt codfish industry. If we lose that industry
we lose the fishermen. You cannot pull
fishermen off the street as you may other
workers. They have got to be born and bred
at the industry or they are not fishermen.
In this important salt codfish industry, very
little money has been invested in modernizing
the production and other facilities. In that
respect many of those engaged in the trade
have come in for criticism. The reason for
this lack of investment is obvious. No one
bas any faith in the maintenance of our position in the foreign markets. In fact we have
been losing ground fast, one market after
another bas been closed or nearly so. With
a policy that could be depended on for future
years, I am very sure the same enterprise as
has shown itself in the frozen fish industry
would be shown by those engaged in this
more important branch.
For centuries the trade was carried on with
many European countries, South America,
Central America, the West Indies, areas in
Africa, and so on. Since union with Canada,
one place after another has become restricted
and closed to our fish.
For many years Newfoundland came under
the British trading and currency agreements
with European countries. That arrangement
was called off with Confederation in prospect
because, well, Newfoundland's export trade
was regarded as a Canadian problem. I, for
one, feel that there was plenty of room for
fruitful negotiation and bargaining which at
the time of union was never pressed-at least,

SENATE
never pressed as I felt it should have been.
As a matter of fact all the thought was given
to the set-up of government, its services and
finance, and very little emnphasis was placed
on the fundamental feature of the enforced
changes in trade. It is by trade that people
live, and that was sometimes forgotten. However, that is another subject and I will not
pursue it at the moment.
It is true in our European trade the Italian
market has been kept going fairly well, but
with open and closed periods, and there has
been no sound basis that can be depended
on for future policy. A trifle of the product
has filtered through to Spain, which formerly
was one of our leading markets. Brazil,
which was a market for 300 years, has dried
up; and so it goes on.
My reason for bringing this out is to show
that here is where special consideration and
facilities should be provided. For reasons,
some of which I have mentioned, the province
of Newfoundland in its foreign trade requirements should not be compelled to run to a
pattern cut out for dominion-wide trade
generally.
Honourable senators, I must ask you to bear
with me while I dwell a short time longer on
this particular industry, salted codfish. Its
importance to Newfoundland justifies a first
place in the consideration of the Government
of Canada. As I said earlier in this talk,
there is a very creditable plan brought out
recently for the development of fish production. In our province it attempts to plot the
future: so much to the good. The industry
is sick. It has now a health program for the
future, if it lives. Its survival depends on
keeping fishermen continuously at their
vocation, which is fishing. That can only be
done over the near years by having value
behind the only product most of them can
handle; that is, salted cod. One of the reasons for this is that they live and fish at a
thousand coves and hamlets, and their processing under those circumstances, in the
main, can only be by salting.
If we don't put value behind the product
by marketing and exchange facilities, the
best codfishing grounds in the world will be
abandoned by Newfoundlanders and that
trade will be carried on by foreign countries,
some of which have been our leading customers. When our breed of fishermen goes,
the industry dies. The medicine bottle, already
labelled, will remain on the shelf.
I can well imagine the reaction to my words
being: is the salt codfishery in itself worth
saving? We hear that question asked in
Newfoundland, but not by informed people.
One hears it occasionally up here as well.

I was surprised to notice a comment by a
member of the other house from Newfoundland to the effect that our traditional markets
are impoverished and we should concentrate
on the American continent with its 170 million people. In the first place, some of our
markets are not impoverished. The buying
power of some of our major markets to the
south is well maintained. The difficulty, of
course, is the weak foreign trade position of
many of the others in terms of dollars.
What is the alternative to the abandonment as hopeless of these long-established
markets? It is indeed the concentration on
the American market for the product processed in other ways, which in any case will
be a slow change-over and we shall lose
most of our fishermen in the meantime. If we
could work out a permanent policy of liberal
trading with the United States-yes, something approaching mutual free trading with
that great country-that would be a different
matter. We love to talk about the unfortified
boundary between Canada and the United
States. Don't let us be so complacent as to
take such foolishness too seriously. With the
clamour for protection in the United States
against everything which we and they produce, and a similar clamour going on here
extending to trade by trade and item by
item, we are waging across the boundary a
customs shooting war which is very real.
Under present conditions to think in terms
of confining a vital trade to the United
States, and a trade which is already under
great pressure in that country for more protection by tariffs and quotas, is sheer folly.
Getting back to my point: Is the salt codfish trade worth preserving? In effect, here's
the answer: The leading producing countries
of salted ground fish, mostly cod, are Norway, France, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Denmark and Canada. In the past three years
the .production of those countries .was
1,300,000 tons. For the previous three years
it was 1,000,000 tons. The production, therefore, was increased in the past three years
by 300,000 tons over the preceding three
years, or an average increase of 100,000 tons
per year-a lot of fish. That is in addition
to the salted fish produced in increasing
quantities by Portugal and Spain for their
own use right off their own shores.
All that quantity of salted fish has gone
into consumption mostly in the markets with
which we have been accustomed to deal for
centuries and have now lost. Salted codfish
is the oldest product of international trade
from the western hemisphere, and world
trade in it is increasing, notwithstanding all
one hears to the contrary. Instead of dying
of old age, it is still growing in stature.

DECEMBER M5 1953
Now, what is the comparative position of
Newfoundland production? There has been
a definite decline in the past three years.
Fresh and frozen production has increased
to a very moderate degree, but flot nearly to
the extent that salted fish production has
declined. How different is this problemn from
most others. In most Canadian products, such
as wheat, if a surplus exists, it is because
of increased production. The codfish industry
has its surpluses coincident with reduced
production.
For the three years 1947-1949 Newfoundland
produced in salted cod 160,380 tons, and in
the three years 1950-1952, since we entered
union with Canada, the production has been
130,800 tons, or an average decline of 10,000
tons per year.
I will put it this way. Against a world increase in production of 30 per cent over
three years there was a decrease of 18J per
cent in Newfoundland production over a similar period.
In presenting these facts I would like to
leave with you a background of the relative
importance of its fisheries to Newfoundland.
The percentage of those employed in flshing,
compared with the total gainfully employed
in ail industries, is greater in Newfoundland
than is the percentage employed in any industry or group of industries in any province
of Canada except those farming in the Prairie
provinces and Prince Edward Island. In fact,
according to the last census figures available
to me when I was preparing facts for this
talk, the number of fishermen in Newioundland
is about the same as ail the fishermen of the
three Maritime Provinces and British Columbia combîned.
Canada's great trading areas, apart from the
United States, are not the countries of great
significance to Newfoundland in its exports.
A very earnest policy of keeping our trade
moving, in what have always been our natural
markets, should be followed. There is another
very special reason for that in the fact that
from the countries to which Canadian export
trade moves most freely there is very little
demand for our type of product. In consequence of this we cannot share proportionately
in the Canadian trade with those important
markets.
I would like to finish these remarks with
a few words concerning United States and
Canada trade. For a great deal of my lifetime my business bas taken me to the United
States many times a year. On this continent is the greatest trading area of the
world and certainly potentially and actually
of the greatest value to Canada. On our side
of the border the development going on is
becoming a matter of worldwide interest.

.With the increasing population to the south,
possibly soon to get topheavy, and on our
side the great potential growth, the fruits of
which our neighbours will need, we and they
have a perfect case for mutual understanding and co-operation.
Instead, both sides now are bickering over
issues many of which, seen in perspective,
are non-essential. I say that both sides are
doing this.
Both have everything to gain and nothing
fundamental to lose by growing dloser and
dloser together economically. One thing we
can be sure of: either we shahl either grow
dloser together, or go farther apart. The
present trend is dangerous.
I arn glad to hear it announced that an
organization on a top level is being set up
by both governments to keep policy in respect
of trade under review. I arn sure that will
be of value, but what is needed to augment
it is a movement that will stretch from coast
to coast in both lands, putting across to the
people how we can be of benefit one to the
other. United States-Canada Clubs-or cal
them what you like-hundreds of them,
operating everywhere, both here and in the
United States, using the press, television and
every other agency to create well-informed
and well-balanced public opinion about our
two countries, would pay off tremendously.
A very useful effort in this direction, at
least from the Canadian point of view. was
made last year by a body of interested
citizens of Canada and the United States.
Most of you will recall the programs broadcast under the auspices of the Town Hall
of New York. in the course of which twenty
absolutely first-class and highly informative
addresses were given by leading citizens of
Canada. This sort of thing is highly valuable,
but it can only touch the fringe of the need.
Our well-developed and highly competent
Trade Commissioner service operates effectively; likewise, the similar organizations of
the United States perform a highly useful
function here. Both, however, operate in a
restricted field as far as public knowledge
and sentiment are concerned. In education,
arts and letters, and possibly scores of
activities, we have an intermingling of
groups.
But in the economic field, reaching down
to the average citizen, I think I can say there
is a wall of ignorance between us. There is
undoubtedly the will to understand, and
there is very generally, I arn sure, a full
measure of respect one towards the other.
With that background we have an ideal
setting for the promotion of mutual interest
in our trading and economic problems by

SENATE
organized effort in both countries. That effort
must reach the people or it will remain
altogether inadequate.
We can never get a solid, sensible basis of
trading relations without more understanding
of the problems involved by the general
public in both countries. There must be a
knowledge of how a correlating of interests
helps us all. That can only come, as I say,
through properly organized and widely
spread publicity by press, radio and on the
public platform in both countries.
As things are now, on both sides of the
border, it is obvious, I am sure, to you all
that we are growing into the habit of bickering, but I feel that with widespread organized
effort we can correct that and develop
together on a much broader and more fruitful plane.
Hon. Mr. Petten: Would the honourable
member permit a question? How, would he
say, does the quality of fish products in
Newfoundland compare with that of our
competitors?
Hon. Mr. Prati: I am glad to be asked
that question. Of recent years, average
quality has fallen off very considerably,
largely because the people generally have
been discouraged by the cost of production
and the low returns. In Newfoundland we
have a distinctive type of quality which we
call sun-dried fish. It enjoys a preference in
certain markets and, except for a small
amount along the Gaspé coast, it is the only
product of its type to be found in any fishproducing area. I think honourable senators
would be interested to know how sun-dried
codfish originated. Around the time of the
Spanish Armada, I think it was, a Spanish
fishing fleet was proceeding to Newfoundland
waters to fish. England was in short supply
of salt, so she captured a number of these
Spanish vessels and brought them into
English ports. The salt was given to English
fishing vessels, which proceeded to Newfoundland waters. They found they had not
enough salt to treat the codfish according
to the approved method of the day, so they
light-salted the fish and, after washing it,
spread it on beaches and boughs on shore
and preserved it by sun drying. That marked
the beginning of sun-dried fish. This method
was copied by the Portuguese, who shipped
codfish to North Brazil, which was then
called the Portuguese Dominion of the South.
My honourable friend from Bonavista
(Hon. Mr. Petten) asked about the quality of
the fish. It is rather a tragedy that our market in North Brazil is almost completely
inactive, for it was one of our best markets
for that type of fish, which market was
started in the period I have just mentioned

and has continued ever since. For the past
has
two hundred years Newfoundland
exported sun-dried codfish directly to that
country, but we have been unable to ship
any substantial quantity in the last three or
four years. I have been told directly by
importers in that country that the demand
is so great that if they had the opportunity
of getting import licences and dollars with
which to purchase, no other quality would
go there except our sun-dried, which they
have been used to for generations. They do
not want any other quality from other markets. Unless we can keep our fish moving
there, that historical preference will die off.
In other markets also that quality is considered distinctive. It is very unfortunate
that at the present time there is a general
falling off in the average standard of quality
of codfish, owing to the discouragement
caused by low prices and the lack of stability
in the trade.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I suppose he is
aware that a well-known firm in the United
Gorton Pew Company of
States, the
Gloucester, Massachusetts, buys a great deal
of salt codfish from the Maritime provinces.
Does he know whether Newfoundland, which
he says has a surplus of salt codfish, sells
any to that company?
Hon. Mr. Prati: I am very pleased to
answer that question. The Gorton Pew Company does buy the Newfoundland product,
which is cured in brine rather than in dry
salt. That American firm buys quite actively
from Newfoundland.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senator,
the question is on the motion of Hon. Mrs.
JodoinHon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before the question is put may I
have leave to say a few words? I promise
they will not be in rebuttal to anything that
has been said during this debate. I would,
however, be less than human if I did not tell
the house that I deeply appreciated the many
complimentary references which have been
made to me in my new position as Leader of
the Government in the Senate. I have appreciated greatly all that has been said, even if
the remarks have been greatly exaggerated.
During the last few weeks I have sent
marked copies of the Senate Hansard to the
members of my family, knowing that they
will enjoy them and hoping that they will
hand thern down to their children and to
their children's children.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
having attended the sittings of the Senate

DECEMBER 15, 1953
since the opening of the present parliament
I feel that I arn now one of you. I feel that
my initiation is now complete and that what
has been said about me here as Leader of
the Governiment has been said on behalf of
ail honourable senators.
Some Hon. Senators.: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
I should like to
congratulate honourable members on their
conducting this debate on a high plane.
There has been nothing acrimonjous about
it.
Some honourable members have expressed criticism of what other honourable
members have said, and there has been
criticism of the government. It is only proper
that honourable senators should criticize
when they think it necessary to do so, but
any criticism 1 have heard during this debate
has been constructive rather than destructive.
I can assure you I arn happy indeed to be
numbered amongst the distinguished citizens
who make Up this assembly and who serve
their country so well.
I have noted the suggestions that have
been made during the course of the debate.
It was suggested that certain matters should
receive the immediate attention of the government, and 1 have already placed those
matters before the government. Some honourable senators suggested that joint committees of both houses be set up for certain
purposes, and I have brought those suggestions to the attention of the government and
will continue to do so. It was suggested too
that certain Senate committees 'be set up.
Those proposals wifl receive my full consideration, and I shall discuss them with
other members of the Senate and with the
government, so that such committees as may
be appointed can be assured of obtaining
the information they desire.
In conclusion, I should like to say once
again how much I have enjoyed listening to
the speeches in this debate; and I wish to
repeat my congratulations to honourable
senators on the splendid manner in which the
debate has been conducted.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Address was adopted.
DEPARTMENT 0F NORTHERN AFFAIRS
AND NATIONAL RESOURCES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned. debate on the motion o! Hon. Mr.
Crerar for the second reading of Bil 6, an
Act respecting the Department of Northern
Aiffairs and National Resources.
Hon. W. M. Asellin.: Honourable senators,
before I make my remarks on this bill, I
would like to say that I think we have
83280-11

listened to a very fine speech from the
honourable senator from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt), and I wish to take this
opportunity of congratulating him Qn his
excellent address.
My remnarks with regard to the bull before
us will be very brie!; I might have completed themn last night, but it was nearly
ten o'clock when I rose to speak and the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was kind enough to say that it would
be quite in order for me to adjourn the
debate, which I did. At that time I was in
the act of congratulating the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
upon the very comprehensive manner in
which he explained the bill. I heard some
honourable senators say afterwards that he
took a long time to do so, but I thought his
remarks were full of meat. No speech of
his has ever been too long for me to listen to.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
gave us a very fine, interesting and instructive lesson in the history and geography o!
that part of our great northwest which is
under discussion. For the benefit of honourable senators who were flot present at last
night's sitting, may I say he told us that
the northern boundary of the provinces of
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba is the 6Oth parallel o! latitude, and
that the northwest territory which we are
now considering embraces ail the land north
of that parailel from the eastern boundary o!
Alaska to Hudson's Bay, and as for north
as the North Pole.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: From Baffin Land to
Alaska.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Weil, it is a huge territory anyway. The honourable senator from
Churchill did flot tell us this, but I understand that it embraces about one and one
hall million square miles.
My honourable friend also deait with the
principle of the bull. The explanatory note
says:
The purpose of this bill is to redefine the present duties and functions of the Minister of
Resources and Development so as to give greater
emphasls to bis responsibility for the administration and development of the North and for Eskimo
affairs.

That briefiy is what the bill is for, although
it covers other matters as well. There can
be little objection to the principle of the
bill, and I am not going to speak further
in regard to it, except to mention some of the
points that the bill covers. Sections 5 and 6
enumerate the duties, powers and functiqns
of the minister, who I think takes the place
of the commissioner appointed under the

Honourable senators, I understand that the

questions I would like to ask when the committee sits.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Has the honourable
senator the assurance that the provinces are
anxious to take on this territory? I have
some doubt of it myself.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I have no definite
assurance from the different provinces, but
I am quite satisfied that they would be glad
to do so.

Another amendment in the bill provides
for the application of these allowances to

In general, I think that covers the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is no objection to

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh moved the
second reading of Bill 28, an Act to amend
the National Parks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments proposed by this legislation are intended to solve certain problems that have arisen
out of the administration of our national
parks. The purposes of the legislation are
clearly set forth in the explanatory note,
which I will read:

with a province or persons for the development and operation of certain public utilities,
such as telephone, electric power and gas
services, for use in park areas. An example
of the need for this particular feature in
Jasper National Park, where a company was
authorized to build a small power plant on
the Astoria River, and has since operated
under lease. Our needs in this area have
now grown to such an extent that it is considered feasible to allow the company to
purchase a plant and extend its present
facilities.
Another amendment which seems reasonable is the desirability of allowing certain
municipalities or persons to acquire water
supplies from the park at a reasonable
charge.
Many streams and rivers rise within the
park boundaries, and many persons outside
the park are dependent on these waters for
their domestic supply. Our park operations
and developments sometimes pollute these
streams and interfere with the natural flow
of the water. The amendment now before
us would permit those persons to obtain an
unpolluted water supply from within the
park. The necessary facilities for bringing
the water to the park boundaries would be
installed by the park's administration and
reasonable charges would be made for the
water supplied.
Another proposed change in the Act is a
provision for issuing permits for the use of
camp grounds. The present act makes no
provision for the issuing of permits authorizing public use of the camp grounds or for
the levying of a charge for lots in the camp
grounds. Owing to the large increase in the
use of these camp grounds, it has become
necessary to have regulations to govern their
use. The proposed amendment provides for
the Governor in Council to make such regulations so that proper control may be
established.
The present act provides for the leasing of
lots in townsites for the purpose of residence
or trade, and for the leasing of lots in other
subdivisions during summer months. Provision is also made for the granting of licenses
covering land outside townsites. Lots in
townsites are leased for year-around occupancy when used for the purpose of residence
or trade, whereas lots in subdivisions are
leased for the summer months, and only for
the purpose of residence. The granting of
licenses for lands in unsurveyed areas is
restricted to purposes for the entertainment
of visitors outside the townsites. It is proposed to enlarge this authority to include
schools, hospitals and churches. Authority

is also being sought to grant leases for these
purposes rather than licenses, as a lease is
a little wider in its scope than is the ordinary
license.
Honourable senators, I submit that the
changes contemplated in this act appear to
be both reasonable and necessary.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Before the honourable
senator resumes his seat, may I ask him if
he is able today to give us any figures indicating the popularity of the national parks.
For instance, does he know the number of cars
that entered the Waterton Lakes Park or the
Riding Mountain Park last year? If he has
not the information today, could he obtain it
and give it to us when the bill is considered
in committee tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I would be glad to
get that information for use in the committee
tomorrow. My knowledge of the parks applies
only to those within the province of Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Alberta has three parks.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: If Jasper and Banff,
which are adjacent to one another are counted
as one, we have three parks, namely, JasperBanff, Waterton Lakes and Elk Island.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The province really has
four parks.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: That is right. As I
say, Jasper and Banff are in the same territory, and for the purposes of our discussion
I count them as one.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, I

That Newfoundland

should have a national park is, I believe,
generally admitted, and I am one of the many
who subscribe to the idea with enthusiasm.
One of the chief purposes of a national
park is to provide a place of recreation for
visitors from other parts of the nation, and
hence a park is a national rather than a
provincial matter. It provides something that
is typically Canadian and to some extent
preserves wild life.
I think it is too early to request a national
park in Newfoundland because, first, we need
better communications between the island and
the mainland than we have now; and secondly,
we should have a good trans-island road
before we lay out a national park. I do think,
however, that the idea of a national park for
Newfoundland should be agreed upon in principle with the province, and a site selected.
I have heard the area around the Terra Nova
river mentioned, and I would suggest that
the minister take this matter up with a view
to selection of a site which would be traversed

park; each of these parks, if my memory
serves me, embraces something like fifteen
hundred or sixteen hundred square miles.
It is highly important that these places
shall be maintained both now and in the
future as closely as possible in their natural
condition. From time to time proposals for
commercial developments in our national
parks have been made, but public opinion
has always resisted these suggestions. During
the last war, in order to guarantee a steady
flow of water from the mountains down to
the turbines of the Calgary Power Company,
which supplied electricity to vital war plants
in the Calgary area, it was necessary to
change Lake Minnewanka in Banff National
Park. This beautiful little lake was accordingly expanded to create a storage reservoir
so that water could be fed from it to maintain the level of water in the Bow river
necessary for the continuous development of
electrical energy. Many people throughout
Canada criticized this work, one commentator describing it as a desecration of the park.
Honourable senators, any attempt to commercialize our national parks would vitiate the
whole intent and purpose that lay behind
the establishment of a national park system.
Public opinion is sensitive about this. I hope
it will continue to be sensitive and to insist
that the original purpose of these parks be
maintained and carried out in their administration. That is why I was in some doubt
about one or two sections of the bill, but these
doubts have been somewhat relieved as the
result of discussions I have had with some
officers of the department.
May I say that I am at a loss to understand what section 2 of the bill means. I
think section 2 of the existing act, with the
proposed amendments, should have been
printed on the page containing the explanatory notes. It is rather difficult to understand the purport of the amendments without having the original section before you.
There does not appear to be anything objectionable about the other sections of the bill.
They tend to extend to some degree the
powers of the parks administration, and provide for leasing land for the establishment of
schools, churches and cemeteries. Permanent
centres are developing in the larger parks,
but all within the framework of the original
intent and purpose for which the national
parks system was established. Certain facilities have to be provided in the parks; and
many of the parks can be made a source of
considerable revenue through wise and prudent administration. No exception can be

taken to reasonable charges for the use of
certain facilities. Things given for nothing
are not appreciated by people as much as
things for which they are charged at least
something. That is a human axiom. A number of our parks have large reserves of standing timber. Some of these are being harvested
by modern methods, but when the administration of the parks came under the old
Department of Mines and Resources no one
was permitted to put a manufacturing plant
of any kind within a park. Timber could
be bought and removed from the parks to
manufacturing plants outside, and that is as
it should be.
I have no doubt that this bill can be fully
justified in committee, where I hope it will
be sent. That would give us an opportunity
to have further clarification on some of the
points which to me at least are not very
clear.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I had intended. My honourable colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has
told me that I am getting into the habit of
making long speeches.
I therefore must
conclude.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I, too, feel that our national parks
should remain in their original state to as
great a degree as possible. However, honourable senators will realize that it is necessary for some people to live in these parks,
and I understand that villages have already
been established in a number of them. The
honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) will correct me if I am wrong,
but I am informed that the village of Banff
comes under the jurisdiction of the dominion
government and is not a separate municipality as are the other municipalities in the
province.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The same is true of
Jasper.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you for that
information. Probably I am correct when I
say that all villages within the boundaries of
our national parks come under the jurisdiction of the dominion government. Honourable senators will appreciate that it is necessary for these communities to have stores,
churches, schools, hospitals and places of
entertainment. I think it is well that the
question was raised as to whether the parks
are not becoming commercialized, for I am
sure everyone in this house feels that the
parks should remain in their original state
as far as possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DECEMBER 15, 1953
REFERRED TO

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: Honourable senators,
before moving that the bill be referred to
committee, I would suggest to the acting
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
that possibly some of the people living in our
national parks are not so keenly interested in
wildlife as he is and would like to attend
church services, at least on Sunday. I cannot guarantee that it would do him any
good to go to church, but I am sure it would
do him no harm.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I may say to the
honourable senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) that I doubt whether his recommendation is necessary, for I have frequently
seen the acting Leader of the Opposition in
church.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: I am glad to hear
that. Perhaps I got a wrong impression.
There are two pretty-fair-sized villages in
the Jasper and Banff parks, and people live
there the year round. The schools, hospitals
and churches are chiefly for them, although
occasionally tourists might find it necessary
to use the hospitals and desirable to attend
church.
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
DIVORCE PETITIONS AND STATISTICS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce Nos. 141 to 148, both inclusive, dealing with petitions for divorce.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine, Acting Chairman of
the committe, moved that the reports be
concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, I now move
that the reports be concurred in, but before
the motion is put I wish, on behalf of the
Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Divorce (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who is unavoidably absent, to present a preliminary report.
To date 334 petitions have been filed. At
the rate petitions are coming in it is expected
that fifty or sixty more will be received by
December 23, the last date when petitions
may be filed. The committee has already disposed of 142 petitions, and seven have been
withdrawn. It is expected, therefore, that a
probable total of 400 petitions will be disposed of by the end of the session; so that
approximately 200 will await disposition
when the committee resumes its hearing in
the new year.
The motion was agreed to, and the reports
were concurred in.

STAFF OF THE SENATE
SIXTH

ECONOMY
OF INTERNAL
REPORT
COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. A. L. Beaubien, Acting Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, presented and
moved concurrence in the sixth report of
the committee.

SENATE
The Clerk Assistant reading:
Your committee have in obedience to the order
of reference of December 15, 1953, considered the
following report from Civil Service Commission:

Some Hon. Senators: Dispense.

The Hon.

the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this report be taken into

consideration?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
as the Senate will probably adjourn today
for the Christmas recess I would move, with
leave, that the report be concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I do not wish to object,
but we have not heard the report read, and
therefore we do not know its contents. A
similar thing happened last year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: In brief, the situation
is this. The Civil Service Commission has
recommended for approval revisions in salary
ranges of Senate employees who come within
the Civil Service Act, and the committee
recommends that these revisions be approved.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The report of the
Civil Service Commission appears in yesterday's Minutes of the Proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I had not noticed that the
figures were given in the Minutes. Have these
figures been passed by the committee without
any amendment at all?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Yes.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I wish to inquire about two items in the
report. At the top of page 149 of the Minutes
the present and the proposed salary ranges
for the Chief of English Minutes and Journals
are shown. It is proposed that the present
minimum salary for this position, $5,240, be
increased to $5,760; and that the present
maximum,

$5,900,

be

increased

to $6,490.

Immediately beneath that item are the present and the proposed salary ranges for the
Chief of French Minutes and Journals. The
present minimum for this position is $4,520,
which it is proposed to increase to $4,970;
and the present maximum is $5,180, which
it is proposed to increase to $5,690. That is
to say, the proposed maximum salary for
this position is $800 less than the proposed
maximum for the corresponding English position. I cannot see why that discrimination
is made. I quite appreciate that most of the
debates in this house are spoken in English,
but the French staff has to remain on duty
for the same length of time as the English
staff. Possibly the mover of the motion (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) will reply that these recommendations have been made by the Civil
Service Commission, but I am sure that he
will agree with me that parliament is supreme

in such matters. In my humble view it is
not a very safe policy to make such discrimination

between

French

and

English

employees.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I would like to have an
answer, Mr. Speaker. It is all right to
shout "Question", but I am stili without an
answer.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The answer is this:
The Civil Service Commission has recommended a revision of salaries, as specified in
the report; and the reason why the Chief of
French Minutes and Journals receives a lower
salary than the Chief of English Minutes
and Journals is, as I understand it, that the
Chief of English Minutes and Journals has a
great deal more work to do. That is the
only answer.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Well, the Chief of
French Minutes and Journals spends the same
amount of time on duty here as the Chief
of English Minutes and Journals. Mind you,
I have no objection whatsoever to the
increase. There is no question of prejudice
or anything of that nature in my mind. Those
who know me know perfectly well that I
believe there is only one kind of citizen in
this country, and that is a Canadian citizen.
If we agree to the principle that all citizens
of this country are on the same footing, that
we are all Canadians, then there should be
equal treatment for everybody. Our fellowcitizens of the English language deserve
great credit, and I lift my hat to them for
the big part they have played in the development of this country, in making it what it
is today; but when we are so anxious to
build up a united nation, without any differences whatsoever between our people, why
is there such discrimination as is disclosed
in this report?
Honourable senators, I think it is high
time for us to make it plain to the whole
country and the rest of the world that Canada has set itself up as an example of a
country in which everybody lives in harmony
and concord, and justice is done in equal
measure to all citizens. I submit that at a
time when so much trouble in the world is
being caused by discrimination and racial
prejudice, we should be very careful to see
that there is no discrimination against any
of our citizens, especially within the body of
this parliament. We shall be setting a very
bad example if we continue such discrimination as is revealed in this report. Let there
be no prejudices. Let there be fairness to
all. We should now make a firm decision
and return these recommendations for salary
increases as reported in the Minutes of the
Proceedings to the Civil Service Commission,

DECEMBER 16, 1953

asking that English and French positions
which are in the same category-as are the
two that I have mentioned-be placed in the
same salary range.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Honourable senators, I
do not want to delay this matter. I am not
a member of the Internal Economy Committee, and in any event I could not have
attended its meeting this morning as I was
at another committee meeting. I have not
read this report, and therefore have no
criticism to offer on it whatsoever. I just
want to ask, for my own information, what
the accepted procedure is. Does the Civil
Service Commission recommend increases
and the Internal Economy Committee automatically pass them? Has the committee any
authority over the matter at all?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: None whatever. The
procedure in cases of this kind is that the
Civil Service Commission makes certain
recommendations, which the government may
adopt, amend or reject. The government has
accepted the commission's report which was
referred to the Internal Economy Committee,
and the committee adopted it unanimously.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Thank you; that is quite
satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Honourable senators,
I wish to say that I share the sentiments
expressed by my colleague from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Dupuis). I too feel that the Civil Service
Commission in its recommendations should
show no discrimination and cause no friction
between the two races in the matter of
salaries.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Beaubien that, with leave of the
Senate, the report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts be concurred in now. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators, I
believe the opinion I have expressed is shared
not only by all Canadians of French origin
but also by a large number of our Englishspeaking friends, and I deem it is my duty
to object to the adoption of this report now.
The Civil Service Commission and the members of this house will, I hope, ponder over
what I have said about the injustice of this
discrimination in salaries.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, as this report can be adopted only with
the unanimous leave of the Senate, in view
of the objection raised the order must stand.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the house decides to allow this
83280-12J

order to stand, may I point out that if the
report is not adopted today the officials and
employees of the Senate will not receive
their pay increases until well after Christmas-perhaps not until sometime in February.
As I understand the remarks of the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis),
they are to the effect that he would like what
he has said to be brought to the attention
of the Civil Service Commission. I do not
think he would want to delay the adoption
of the report and thereby deprive the Chief
of French Minutes and Journals of even the
increase in salary that the report recommends.
I can assure my honourable friend that if
the report is adopted now his remarks will
be brought to the attention of the commission.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators,
with the explanation of our distinguished
leader and his promise that my suggestions
will be brought forward and recommended to
the Civil Service Commission for immediate
consideration, I would have no reason for
holding up the passage of this report today.
I am sure that if this matter is treated
seriously the proper increase in pay can be
made retroactive to the effective date. At
any rate, I bow to the suggestion of my
leader, and, with the assurance he has given
me, I have no further objection to the adoption of this report.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I too withdraw my objection, after the
explanation given by the honourable leader.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
SEVENTH

REPORT OF INTERNAL ECONOMY
COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. A. L. Beaubien, Acting Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, presented and
moved concurrence in the seventh report of
the committee.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I inquire of the
honourable senator whether this report relates to a five-day or a six-day week?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Seven days. By this
report it is intended to grant to the temporary employees of the Senate the approximately ten per cent increase which has been
granted to the permanent employees. That
is the whole purpose of the report. Temporary
employees do not come under the Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Do I understand my
honourable friend to say that these per diem
rates are for seven days a week?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That makes a great
difference.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Do the employees work
seven days?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No. I think it should
be clearly understood that this report is
simply to automatically · onfirm a statement
c
made by the Minister of Finance three days
ago, to the knowledge of as well as for the
information of the whole world. All we are
doing is confirming the statement that was
put out by the Minister, accepting recommendations of the Civil Service Commission.
The details in so far as they relate to the
Senate are set down in the Orders of the
Day for the purpose of showing what part
of the total appropriation is devoted to the
Senate. If anybody disagrees with the report
I would suggest that he take up the matter
with the Minister of Finance and the government.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I do not want the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
to be worked up, to have his blood pressure
raised, and all that sort of thing: I merely
asked a question because I wanted information. In the preceding instance when increases were recommended the Clerk Assistant started to read the report, somebody said
"Dispense", and I-perhaps negligently-did
not look at the printed report in the Minutes
and therefore did not know what it contained.
Probably "all the world" knows what the
Minister of Finance said, but unfortunately I
did not read it. It is too bad.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And the honourable
senator is a newspaper man!
Hon. Mr. Davies: But surely a senator is
entitled to ask for information without having
a lecture read to him by a representative
of the government.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was adopted.
DIVORCE

PETITION

REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. W. M. Aseltine, Acting Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Divorce, presented the Committee's report No. 149, dealing with a petition for divorce.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: With leave, I move that
the report be now concurred in.
The motion was agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
could the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) inform the house what legislation we may expect from the other house
before we adjourn for the Christmas recess?
Could he also advise us when the adjournment will take place, so that we may
make our train reservations and other
arrangements?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I cannot say definitely what further legislation we shall receive before adjourning for
Christmas, but I am informed that the bill
to amend the Customs Act, which is now
being considered in the other place, may
come to us this afternoon. I hope that if
it does we can deal with it later today. When
our business has been completed this afternoon I shall move that the Senate adjourn
during pleasure, to reassemble at the call of
the bell.
For the Christmas recess I intend to move
that the Senate stand adjourned until
January 19. I believe the other house will
adjourn until January 12, so our holiday
period will extend one week beyond theirs.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does the honourable
senator expect to have Royal Assent before
adjourning?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is expected that
Royal Assent will take place this evening;
otherwise we shall meet tomorrow.
PRIVATE BILL
ASSOCIATED CANADIAN TRAVELLERSSECOND READING

Hon.

J. Wesley

Siambaugh

moved

the

second reading of Bill T-3, an Act respecting
the Associated Canadian Travellers.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like
to give a brief resume of the aims and objects
of the Association of Canadian Travellers.
This association was formed in Calgary in
1919, and in 1921 the federal government
granted it a charter with power to issue
charters to subsidiary clubs or branches
throughout the whole of Canada.
The primary purpose of the organization
was to form clubs across the country, whose
mernbers could get together at regular intervals for social activities, discuss their mutual
problems and get better acquainted with each
other. But as the years have passed a much
wider view has been taken of the duties and
responsibilities of the clubs, and in February,
1932, the association embarked on a plan of
accident insurance for members only. In

He said: Honourable senators, I move the

market, and who arrived here with the
impression that free trade would be the
policy of the government they supported,
were soon disillusioned; and I think I can
safely say that that policy has never been
implemented.
When I examined this bill and realized just
what it means I said to myself "Shades of
R. B. Bennett!", because legislation which
the Bennett government passed, and which is
still on the statute books, is practically the
same as the present bill: the difference, I am
advised, is very slight.
For the information of honourable senators
I may give a synopsis of the law as it stands
and the law as passed by the Bennett administration. The relevant section is to this effect,
that if the government is satisfied that goods,
other than those subject to the British preference, are being imported into Canada "under
such conditions as prejudicially or injuriously
to affect the interests of the Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor
General may authorize the minister to fix a
value for duty of any class or kind of such
goods, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this act the value so fixed shall be
deemed to be the fair market value"; and the
value so fixed was subject to no appeal.
Under the bill that we are now asked to pass
there is no appeal from the minister either.
So, I repeat, if there is any difference between
the present act and the bill before us, it is
merely one of degree. The intent is the same.
It seems to me that this bill merely brings to
light the attitude of the Liberal party all
through the years, and I shall expect the
free traders in this house to get up and
oppose this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are you in favour of it?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would leave the
Customs Act as it now stands on the statute
books.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
can assure the acting Leader of Her Majesty's
Loyal Opposition in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine)-whose party seems to be reduced
to an infinitesimal point at this moment-that
he is entirely mistaken if he imagines I am
taking part in this debate as a result of his
challenge.
The honourable senator made
some reference to my political past and to the
trade principles that I have advocated from
time to time. Let me assure him that I have
not changed those principles.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I still believe that an
expanding trade is good for our country and
that it is unfortunate if anything stands in
the way of that trade. Great as my efforts
have been in the past, I have never been

able to convince my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) of the soundness
of my theories.
Honourable senators, I have a few observations to make about this legislation. It is a
matter of regret that this bill comes to us
only twenty minutes before nine o'clock on
the night that the Senate is to adjourn for
the Christmas recess. This is an important
piece of legislation and we should not be
placed in the position-and this is not a
criticism of the Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)-where
we have to give important legislation hasty
consideration. The honourable member from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) explained the
principle of the dumping duty; that is, if a
manufacturer in the United States, say, offers
goods for sale in Canada at a lower price than
he was selling them in the United States,
that is considered to be dumping the goods
into Canada. It is well worth recalling that
this principle has been in our tariff structure
for well over fifty years. It was first introduced into parliament by the late Honourable
W. S. Fielding when he was Minister of
Finance in Sir Wilfrid Laurier's first government.
Now we are to have a new basis for determining whether or not goods are being
dumped into Canada. The new basis is that
in the discretion of the minister-and it will
be observed in this section of the bill that
the minister is given pretty wide powersthe value for duty purposes can be taken as
an average of the price of the goods in the
country of export, going back over a period
of six months. That means that if goods
were selling at say, 100 and they declined to
50, within six months, the minister could take
an average of 75 for duty purposes. If there
were a limitation to this departure in matter
of time it might be less objectionable; but,
honourable senators, this amendment will
shortly be embedded in our tariff structurefor I have no doubt the amendment will be
passed here-for all time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My friend the honourable
senator fron Waterloo says "not necessarily",
but I have no expectation that the measure
will be changed in the foreseeable future.
I want to emphasize that this change will be
fundamentally the basis for value under the
anti-dumping law, and henceforth the basis
for value will be, not the price for which the
goods are sold in the country of export,
but the average price in that country going
back for a period of six months. This will
apply not only to textiles but to all other
classes of manufactured goods imported into
Canada, so that the effect of the amendment,

SENATE
if I understand the section aright, will be to
raise the average price on which the dumping
duty applies. I do not think that is a sound
provision, and certainly I do not for a
moment think that we should be asked to
approve it in the matter of a few hours.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We should have an opportunity for consideration in committee, with
officers of the department present to explain
how they propose to apply the amendment.
In that way we woulid have something on
record.
Of course, I realize, as I think everyone
else does, that perhaps this is a trend of the
times, and that the day is gone wihen lower
tariffs were advocated as the means of increasing production and expanding trade in
Canada. We live in a period, or an age, of
selfishness, when it seems that everyone is
coming to the government for assistance and,
as I said the other day, demanding that the
government solve his problems. The farmers of Canada, for the most part, who have
always suffered and still do and always will
suffer under a protective tariff, are in some
instances seeking protection for a certain industry and urging the government to impose
duties against the admission of oils and fats
that go into the manufacture of margarine, or
are applying for protection against the importation of vegetables, fruits, and other food
commodities.
This bill gives encouragement, further
encouragement, to any interests which suffer
to come and lay their troubles on the doorstep of the government and demand that the
government do something about them. Now,
there is probably no matter that has been
more thoroughly discussed in the last few
years than our expanding trade and the need
of expanding trade. There has not been an
international conference called that has not
discussed the need of an expanded world
trade. Certainly it is necessary, and especially for a country like Canada, which has to
export anywhere up to probably twenty-five
per cent of her production. It is vital that
our trade expand and grow. Now, how are
you going to expand trade on the one hand
if, on the other hand, you take steps to prevent the importation or make more difficult
the importation of goods into Canada by
which our exports can be paid for? The whole
thing is entirely inconsistent, and that brings
me to this criticism: that there is apparently
no principle at all guiding public policy in
these matters, and it may well be that the
absence of a sound policy will ultimately
land us in chaos. I repeat that we should
have more time to consider this matter, to
call witnesses, to explore, to find out what
its significance is and what it may lead to.

But we won't do it; we shall pass the bill.
And, in closing, may I just say that this is
the sort of thing that brings this house into
disrepute throughout the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If we take important
matters like this and pass them through in
order to rush home at midnight or tomorrow,
we cannot escape criticism; and as far as I
am concerned I am bound to say that I think
the criticism will be well deserved.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to say anything with
regard to this bill, but the acting Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has done
me the honour to refer to me as one of the
Maritime free traders and he wonders what
I have to say about the bill. That is rather a
challenge that I do not feel like letting go by
without saying a word or two. I had thought
that this old shibboleth of free trade had
passed in this country and other countries
many years ago. The acting Leader of the
Opposition wants to know where I stand. I
want to tell him that I stand for the freeest
kind of trade that is advantageous to our
country. I am for Canada first, and I want
our workmen to have fair competition so that
they can make a living under conditions that
will not put them at too great a disadvantage.
Elements of control occur in all our trade
agreements. When we suggested a reciprocity
treaty with the United States many years ago,
the proposal was turned down by my friends.
They wanted "No truck or trade with the
You recall that, there was a
Yankees".
provision in that proposed treaty that if our
money went up or down a certain per cent in
relation to United States currency, or if we
subsidized a product, countervailing duties
would be imposed on our goods and they could
not be exported to the United States.
This anti-dumping clause has been in the
law for many years. To conform to this
provision in the law, foreign-made goods must
be sold in Canada at a price equal to the
price charged under like conditions in the
country of origin. If a foreign manufacturer
has surpluses and dumps his goods into Canada, that creates a condition which is not good
for the internal and economic affairs of this
country, and I think that condition has been
envisaged: it has been considered in the making of most trade agreements. The unusual
condition that exists today is one that the
government should keep an eye on. After
all, this is only a homeopathic dose, it is
nothing to worry about; it simply means that
foreign manufacturers are not going to be

DECEMBER 16, 1953
permitted to dump their goods into Canada
at unreasonably low prices fixed solely for
the purpose of getting rid of surplus goods
regardless of cost.
Honourable senators, we talk about tariffs
and protection, but to my mind tariffs are
only a minor item in the trade of today. What
worries me is how we are going to trade
with countries who have no money with
which to pay for our goods, or whose currency has been deflated to the point where
they cannot afford to buy from us. That is a
most effective kind of protection. Beyond
that, there are countries such as Great Britain
and Australia which deliberately prohibit
certain importations. I did not hear my honourable friend get up and say that was against
Liberal policy. No; that is against world
policy. For how can Canada be a free-trade
country in a protectionist world? We want to
trade with the other countries; we have
to do it on a scientific basis, and it takes the
best brains in our country to see to it that
it is done in the most effective way.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have always said that
you were coming around to my point of view.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The Tory party always
wanted protection and high tariffs; yet, a few
years ago they went to Manitoba, chose a
free trader as leader and they preached free
trade. But it did not get them very far in
this country, because the people did not want
an imitation. The net result was that the
Liberal party continued to lead and is still
leading today. Honourable senators, we have
been promoting the best trade we could have
in the interests of our country, and that is as
far as anybody can go. Certainly, we cannot trade when the cards of protectionism
are stacked against us. For instance, only the
other day the United States proposed an
arrangement that was submitted to, by which
the entry of our oats into the United Statesyes, oats from my friend's part of the country,
western Canada-was restricted. We agreed
to such an arrangement because it was the
best deal we could make.
I know we have people who want to give
away everything that we possess, regardless
of the terms, but I am not in favour of that
type of trading. In my opinion, this bill contains a wise provision which will keep people
employed in our country and help to maintain
our general economy.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, may
I say a few words in reply to one or two
points raised by the acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)?

The Hon. the Speaker: May I remind
honourable senators that if the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
speaks now, he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should also like to
draw attention to some points raised by my
friend and revered deskmate (Hon. Mr.
Churchill), the great free trader.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is somewhat of a surprise to hear the acting leader opposite
describe me as a free trader. As a matter
of fact, I have the reputation of being a hightariff man-which, by the way, I never was.
It is true, however, that at one time when
I was in the House of Commons I voted in
opposition to a Liberal budget which reduced
tariffs, for the reason that I thought it showed
discrimination-and I don't like that discrimination, for more than one reason. Ever
since I voted against the government on that
occasion I have been known as a high-tariff
man or a protectionist.
In theory, I am just as much a free trader
as is my friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), and I believe that when other countries impose high tariffs against our goods
the least we can do, in fairness to our own
people, is to show a little bit of preference
in our own market. That is as far as I
ever go.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend from Churchill
thinks this bill is a radical departure from
accepted policy; but I say it is the most
natural thing in the world. As I explained
briefly a moment ago, we have an antidumping law; and at least foreigners cannot
sell their goods in this country at a price
lower than the goods command in the country
of origin. Surely this is not a case of
increasing tariff s. It is merely getting at
the true basis of valuation of goods coming
into Canada by taking their average selling
price over a period of six months. We know
that a manufacturer in the United States,
for instance, may for a few weeks or less
sell his goods at a certain price, and then,
finding that he had a surplus, decide that it
is to his benefit to sell those goods at any
price, however low. The same course is
followed by the merchant who, because
goods on his shelves have become shopworn
or gone out of style, is reduced to selling
them at less than cost. I do not think that
slaughter-price values are a fair basis on
which to appraise goods for sale in a country
like Canada.
If I had had the drafting of the bill I
would have gone a little further than this

SENATE
bill goes. By that I do not mean that I
would have made the provisions more
stringent, but for the purpose of administration I would have adopted the principle that
goods imported into this country should be
valued at the cost of production plus a fair
profit. That would be a reasonable rule, and
it would correct the conditions with which
the bill seeks to deal.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am a little concerned
about the possibility of difficulties in the
matter of administration; but the Minister
of National Revenue assures us that he has
the machinery to handle the matter, and I
am quite willing to take his word for it.
However, I hope my honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) will not go
away saying that in this bill the government
is changing the whole basis of the present
system. We are not doing that at all.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I did not say that the bill
would change the whole basis. What I said
was that it changes the basis of the application of the anti-dumping law.
Hon. Mr. Euler: All it provides is that the
price, instead of being computed on an average period of -one, two or three days, shall be
assessed in respect of a period of not more
than six months. That is eminently reasonable; and, in saying so, I am not making a
protectionist argument. The law is changed
to provide that goods which come into this
country shall be valued upon a fair basis.
I cannot see anything wrong with that.
As regards the remarks of my honourable
friend the acting Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), I do not know whether
he is out of step with his party or not. I
have known Conservatives from my district
who were high protectionists when they left
Ontario and turned into free traders when
they got to Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I never heard anything
like that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I wonder what the Conservatives' policy is today-whether they are
going to stick to their high-tariff principles.
The word I have received from the other
house is that Conservative members in that
place want the principle of the bill to be
applied not merely to manufactured articles
but to products of all kinds. I do not know
whether, in that respect, my honourable
friend is in step with his party.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I extend to the honourable gentleman an invitation to join our
party.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thank my friend very
much: I will take the idea into serious
consideration.
Aseltine: The honourable
Hon.
Mr.
member's ideas are similar to my own.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, I agree with almost
everybody. I remember so well that at one
time the difference between the two parties
as far as tariffs are concerned was put in
this way: the Conservatives talk high tariff
and practise a moderate tariff, whereas the
Liberals talk low tariff and practise a
moderate tariff. I think that describes the
situation very well. There is no high tariff
advocate in this chamber. The difference
between this bill and the Bennett policy is
that when Mr. Bennett took office he carried
out what he had been advocating; he raised
the tariffs and he raised them sky high:
afterwards they were reduced, though perhaps not enough to satisfy some of my
friends here. I repeat that what we are
asked to approve is, not a change of the tariff,
but a change in the method of valuating
certain classes of goods which are brought
into this country. And I say that it is fair
to base the valuation on what has been the
average price during a fairly long period of
time rather than on the price during a short
period of two or three weeks.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
RETURN OF HON. MR. HAIG TO THE CHAMBER

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I ask you to allow me the special privilege of saying a word or two at this time. I
have spoken to the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and have told him
that I intend to say a few words on a personal
matter.
I first want to congratulate you, Mr.
Speaker, on your elevation to Speaker of this
chamber. I have had the very great pleasure
of being opposite you for eight sessions and
I have enjoyed your confidence very much

indeed.
I would also congratulate the new leader
in this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). I had
the great pleasure of knowing him for a
number of years as a very prominent member
and later as the Speaker in another place, and
I welcome him as a worthy member of this
chamber.

I cone now to welcome the new senators:
first, the ladies, or, as I prefer to call them,
the women, who have been nominated to
this house. I hope the three new women
members will be as able representatives of
their sex as the first two women senators have
been for the past eighteen years, to my personal knowledge.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I also want to welcome the
other new members. There was a time in the
house when I would not have been able to say
what I am going to say now. However, I am
getting now to be one of the older representatives in point of service in this house, and I
say quite candidly that I hope you all will

have as much pleasure in serving the people
of Canada in this chamber as I have had during my eighteen years' experience here.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The rest of my remarks are
purely personal. I first want to thank every
member of this house, and especially those
who wrote me during the second week in
August after the passing of my life partner.
Only those who have had the experience can
know what one passes through at such a time.
Nobody can tell them. I thought I knew, but
I found that I did not know. I thank all honourable senators who sent me messages
expressing condolence. Believe me, fellow
members, they were helpful in those terrible
days.
Later, I suffered an accident. Some might
say that I had been out too long that day, but
it was purely an accident. I fell down the
cellar steps at my son's residence and was
pretty badly shaken up. I want to say this,
as my personal experience, that in the few
seconds it took me to go down those steps I
thought of a lot of things. The mind is a
great machine, it works like lightning. I
knew if I hit with my head on the floor of that
cellar that there would be a vacancy in the
senate representation from the province of
Manitoba. You may say I cannot think that
fast. But believe me, I thought far faster than
that when I was heading for the basement.
I knew if I kept my arms over my head I
might smash my arms but I could at least
protect my head.
I need not go on with the details of my
accident. For four months, I was under the
care of two able medical men, one of whom a
fellow senator from that district knows very
well, and three of the loveliest young women
in the finest profession that I think women
can engage in, that of nursing the sick.
After those four months my medical attendants told me they had had a struggle to pull
me through. I thank Providence that they
were able to bring me back to health.
I should like to thank all honourable members who wrote and telegraphed to me while
I was in hospital, and also those who made
mention of me in their speeches and thanked
me for past services.
My doctor told me that when he called on
me each morning he could tell whether I had
had a letter from Ottawa the day before. He
would ask, "Well, what Liberal wrote to you
I would reply that I had heard
today?"
from someone of that political persuasion.
He would then tell me that he could see I
was happier and more contented for having
received such messages of cheer.

SENATE
I should like to thank those honourable
senators who were able to visit me. To the
new senators may I say that I am really not
as good as my colleagues made out I wasthey were just being kindhearted and wanted
to give me a little boost. I presume honourable senators thought I would be reading
Hansard or having it read to me. That is
quite true, and I know what has been said
about me. The encouragement I received
from my fellow members in this house helped
me a great deal in my fight against the nervous strain caused by my fall.
I do not want the new members in the
years that lie ahead to think that my friends
here were pulling a long bow in the kind
things they said about me. I know I was
not worthy of all that was said, but I also
know that if I was not worthy of it in the
past I shall try to be so in the future, for
the general good of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am sure that on behalf of all of you
I can extend a welcome to the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) upon his return
to this house. We missed him very much
indeed.
Although I have not sat in the house with
the honourable senator before this evening,
I know that the remarks about his ability in
performing his duties in this house were
made from the heart, and that those who
spoke so highly of him were indeed sincere.
Say what he may tonight, I assure him that
the new members do believe everything that
was said about him.
Along with the other members of this
house, I am very happy to know that our
honourable colleague has made such a splendid recovery. We hope that he will not work
too hard. I can assure him that in his absence
his deputy, the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), carried on his duties
in an excellent manner.
Som Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I hope that the hon-urable Leader of the Opposition, if he should
feel a little fatigued from time to time, will
not attempt to work too hard, but will
take advantage of whatever rest he can. We
want to have him with us in full fighting
form for many years to come. If he is tired
from time to time, the honourable member
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who is
in the best of health and good spirits, will,
I know, be glad to relieve him.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

THE LATE SENATORS
DENNIS

BURKE AND

TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, perhaps at this time I may be permitted
to refer to the passing of two of our very
esteemed members. It is with the greatest
regret that I have to inform the house that
since we last met we have lost an esteemed
and respected colleague in the person of the
late Senator Vincent Burke, who bas passed
to his eternal reward. I am sure that all of
you will want to join me in extending to his
wife and daughters our sincere sympathy.
Senator Burke was born at St. Jacques,
Newfoundland, on August 3, 1878. He was
the son of Patrick Isaac Burke and Alice
Mullowney. He received his early education
at St. Jacques Public School, St. Bonaventure's College, and Columbia University,
New York. Upon graduation, he launched
a career which was devoted not to the
gratification of his own ambition but the
advancement of his fellow citizens in Newfoundland by making more readily available
to thern facilities for improved educational
standards from grade school to university.
After serving as principal of Torbay High
School, he became superintendent of Roman
Catholic schools on the island, and later,
deputy minister of education. When the
department of education was organized under
the commission government our late senator
became the first director of adult education.
One of his -contributions at that time towards
education in Newfoundland was his leadership in founding Newfoundland Memorial
University, of whose board of trustees he
became the first chairman. Not only will he
be remembered as one of its founders, but
it was through his advocacy that the Carnegie
Foundation of New York contributed large
sums towards the new college. The late
senator's whole life was devoted to public
service, which won for him recognition both
by church and by state.
In 1917, in recognition of his war work, he
was made a Member of the British Empire
order; in 1930 be was promoted to be an
Officer in the same order; and in 1946, a
Commander. In 1914 he was awarded the
Cross Pro Ecclesia by Pope Pius X, and in
1940 he was made a Knight Commander of
Saint Gregory by Pope Pius XII.
A lifetime of public service was crowned
by his being summoned to the Senate in
1950. Although he was a member of this
chamber for only three years, Senator Burke
gained the respect of everyone here during
that time.

JANUARY 19, 1954
Many successful Newfoundlanders will
always owe a debt of gratitude to the late
Senator Burke for the immeasurable contribution he made towards their early education. Honourable senators, while we deplore
his short term of service here, and mourn
his passing, we shall long remember Senator
Burke as a great gentleman -and a man who
devoted his life to the public good.
We have also lost another of our members
in the person of the late Senator W. H.
Dennis of Halifax, who passed away suddenly.
Although we were aware of his uncertain
health, his jovial disposition and generous
open-hearted manner dispelled all reminders
of his disability. Since I assumed my duties
in this house he exhibited the greatest
kindness towards me personally, and I shall
always remember his consideration and
friendliness.
The late senator was born at Stewiacke in
Nova Scotia on March 31, 1887, a son of
Henry Parnell Dennis and Wilhelmina
Dennis. At an early age he went to Halifax,
where he was employed by his uncle, the
late Sen-ator William H. Dennis, then
publisher of the Halifax Herald. Senator
Dennis rose from elevator boy and printer's
devil to become one of the leading newspaper
figures in the Maritimes. He was a foremost
champion of Maritime rights, and a valued
member of this chamber. The story of his
life is an inspiration to the youth of today,
and is an example of what can be accomplished through energy and application.
On the death of his uncle, our late colleague
became President and Managing Editor of
the Halifax Herald and Halifax Mail, and a
few years ago he purchased the Halifax Star
and the famous newspaper once published by
Joseph Howe, the Halifax Chronicle. The
merged papers became the Chronicle-Herald
and Mail-Star.
The late senator's ability was recognized by
Prime Minister Bennett, and he was summoned to the Senate in 1932 at the early age
of forty-four years. In this chamber he immediately distinguished himself by promoting
the formation of the Senate's Special Committee on Tourist Traffic, of which he became
chairman. The result of that investigation
into the tourist facilities of Canada resulted
in the formation of the Canadian Travel
Bureau. His name will for many years be
associated with the tourist industry, which
has reached such overwhelming importance
today.
The late senator's interest in promoting
education is also well known. He established
prizes and bursaries in virtually every Maritime educational institution. He received

from Acadia University its Doctorate of Civil
Law and from Saint Francis Xavier its
honorary Doctorate of Law.
Greatest of all his characteristics was his
immense charity to less privileged persons.
Religious connection or political affiliation
made no difference. Indeed the full measure
of his contributions to these citizens will
never be known. Among his benefactions was
his founding of a summer colony for underprivileged children, as well as generous donations to hospitals and charitable institutions.
The late Senator Dennis was a great Maritimer, a great gentleman and a great Canadian. His loss will be keenly felt by everyone in this chamber. I wish to extend to his
widow, his son Graham, and his daughter
Pauline, the heartfelt sympathy of a grateful
country.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
except for those from Newfoundland I think
I knew the late Senator Burke better than
did any member in this chamber. While in
Ottawa we always stayed in the same hotel,
and it was our custom on Sunday evenings
after attending church service to join with
others in the hotel in a discussion of the
affairs of church and state and kindred subjects. Senator Burke and his dearly beloved
wife always took part in these friendly meetings, and it was then that I came to really
love the old gentleman. He knew he had
reached a stage in his life when he could
not make as great a contribution to this chamber as he had in the field of education in
his native province. As an outstanding educationalist of long standing in Newfoundland,
he felt it was a great honour to the cause
of education that he was summoned to the
Senate of Canada.
Those of us who knew the late senator intimately soon realized why the people of Newfoundland held him in such high esteem. As
one who is interested in education, I enjoyed
hearing him tell about the history of this
subject in his province. Education is extremely important to the life of Canada, and
the Senate was indeed fortunate to have
amongst its members a man who so clearly
understood the educational problems confronting our people today.
I deeply regret the passing of Senator Burke
and I wish to extend to his widow my most
sincere sympathy.
Honourable senators, although Senator
Dennis had been a member of this chamber
for many years, I did not know him so well
because in recent years illness prevented
him from regularly attending the sittings of
this house. Senator Dennis was a gentleman

SENATE
in the real sense of the word. He had a keen
appreciation of the obligation which went
with the wealth he commanded, and tried to
discharge that responsibility to the people
of his own part of the country. In that
respect the great contributions he made were
largely, although not wholly, for the furtherance of education, which is a very noble
cause.
We all hoped that Senator Dennis would
fully recover his health, and be able to give
the same keen leadership in connection with
the problems which face this house that he
gave to the newspaper business in his own
province. He was an outstanding newspaper
man. The men I know in Halifax always
recognized him as one of the leading newspaper men in Canada. We are happy to have
men of that calling as members of this
chamber; they can contribute more than they
know to its deliberations, because they
understand best what goes to the public.
Naturally, in a small group like ours, the
passing of a member is a very important
event. We know that when Bill Dennis did
a job he did it well. He has left a great
record, and Nova Scotians and the people
of the other Maritime provinces can be
proud they had such a son to represent them
in the parliament of Canada.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, as
a Newfoundlander I rise today to pay tribute
to the memory of a man who will always
be remembered in Newfoundland as an educator and patriot-a man who gave great
impetus to the raising of the standards of
teaching in all its branches. It can be truthfully said that Vincent Burke devoted his
whole life to the cause of education.
The Memorial University College, which
>pened its doors about thirty years ago, can
today be termed not only a memorial to
those who laid down their lives in the First
Great War, but to such men as Senator
Burke. The many trials and tribulations that
he had to overcome were only surmounted
by enthusiasm, perseverance and, above all,
vision and imagination. Those who today are
enjoying the fruits of higher education in
Newfoundland owe Vincent Burke a debt of
gratitude.
During his long and useful life be was not
without recognition by church or state. He
was deputy minister of education, chairman
of the board of trustees of the Memorial
University College, and held many other distinguished posts. His Majesty King George V
made him a Commander of the British
Empire Order. His Holiness Pope Pius XII
elevated him to be a Knight of the Church.
Columbia University, where be received his

master's degree, always had a very warm
spot in his heart; and as far as the Carnegie
Institute is concerned, he seemed to have perpetual use of its funds, for without its aid
the iMemorial University College would still
be in the embryo stage. So, I say, Vincent
Burke, in a unique sense, is the father of our
university.
The late senator had a much broader outlook upon his fellows than just the academic
one. His active personal interest in social
welfare led him to believe that Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders should have no
more and no less social advantages than her
So when Confederation
sister dominion.
became an issue it was only natural that
this man, with his courageous and beneficial
outlook, should devote himself unceasingly
to what be considered to be the advantage
of the people.
His patriotism stood out against unbelievable opposition and harsh criticism. He could
well feel proud of the role he played in
fighting ignorance, fanaticism and prejudice.
He leaves the imperishable memory of a
good man, a patriot and certainly a good
servant of the people. Above all he was a
great Christian gentleman.
To the family and to the associates of
our beloved friend, I extend my deepest
sympathy.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, coming as I do from Halifax, I wish
to join with other honourable senators who
have paid such fine tributes to our late
departed colleague and friend, Senator W. H.
Dennis.
I had been fairly closely associated in a
business way with Senator Dennis for well
over forty years. In our early days of
friendship we had much in common, and
that friendship and association continued
down through the years.
As honourable senators may have noticed,
since the time I became a member of this
chamber the late senator and I have maintained our intimate association. We sat near
one another in this chamber, and on many
occasions discussed together matters and
measures which came before us for consideration. I always found his judgment sound
and intelligent and his advice such as one
would welcome.
As you will recall, Senator Dennis was
particularly interested in the tourist trade.
In 1934, as a member of the Nova Scotia
Legislature, I came to Ottawa to represent the
Nova Scotia government in connection with
the tourist industry. I recall that from then
until the time of his passing our late col-

JANUARY
league continued his deep interest in this
particular phase of Canadian development.
It was less than a week ago-in fact, last
Wednesday when he was in conversation with
me-that he referred to the fact that we
must at once get the tourist committee work
under way so as to be ready in the early
part of the session to consider that important
phase of our national economy.
Honourable senators, one could not ask
for a more loyal colleague, a finer type with
whom to co-operate, or a truer friend, than
Bull Dennis. He was a man with a wonderfui understanding and a remarkably sympathetic feeling for the needs of others. I
need flot dwell at length on his generous
nature. His deeds of klndness, which were
many, were done not to create goodwill for
himself but rather with the thought in mind
of their benefit to others. His nature, as
I feel miany connected wîth the Senate can
testîfy, was naturally generous.
I join wlth those who have already spoken
in extending sincere and heartfelt sympathy
to Senator Dennis's widow, his son, and his
daughter.
In the introduction to his book Postscript to
Adventure it is related that the late Dr.
Charles W. Gordon, better known to our
western members, particularly those from
Winnipeg, as Ralph Connor, started to write
a tribute to his friend, Rev. Dr. Clarence
MacKinnon, Principal of Pine Hill University.
The tribute read:
A common sorrow, a common loss. Dearly loved
andi trusted. my oldtime friend, comrade and fellow
worker, has gone from, our sight. The voice which
so often charmed us is still. That smiie of warm
Illumination that s0 often drew our hearts to him
Is no more.

I think, honourable senators, those words
fit very nicely into any tribute which we
rnight pay to the late Senator Dennis.
I think of him as you do, Mr. Speaker, as
a dearly loved intimate friend, loyal to the
heart's core, true in ail circumstances. We
remember him and thank God for men of
his type. His friendship enriched if e for us
and strengthened our faith in man and in
God.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, had the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) been here this
evening I would naturally have left for hlm
the duty of saying a word or two, not only
as to a colleague in the Senate who has
passed away, but as a very able newspaper
colleague. However, as I came in the chamber the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Bishop) asked me if 1 would make
some reference this evening to Senator
Dennis' career as a newspaper man.

19, 1954
I agree with everything that has been said
about the late Senator Dennis. 1 knew Billy
Dennis for years. I knew him as a great
Canadian who published a very fine newspaper in Halifax for many long years, but I
also want to pay a special tribute to him for
what he did in helping to build the Canadian
Press which, as most of you know, is the
news-gathering agency which supplies news
to ail the daily newspapers from one end of
Canada to the other.
Canada, as you can readily understand, la
a very difficult country to cover from a news
gathering point of view. The founders of the
Canadian Press, of whom our colleague, the
Honourable Senator from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) was one, undertook a very
difficult task when they decided to form a
nation-wide news-gathering agency. At that
time we had a small agency in Ontario, and
a larger agency known as the Western Canadian Press Agency. However, in 1917, these
news-gathering agencies were amaigamated,
and Senator Dennis became a member of the
directorate of the new agency. Later on,
when I became -a member, I sat wlth him on
that directorate for many years, and I know
that he did a very big job. He was always
ready wlth constructive ideas and suggestions.
He was one who, with many others of us, f elt
that the time had corne when we should no
longer accept a subsidy of $50,000 a year from
the Canadian Govermnent. We knew when
we made the decision to no longer accept that
subsidy that it was going to be d.lfficult te
carry on wlthout it, but Senator Dennis and
others felt that we should be completely free
of influence of any kind. From that time on
the Canadian Press, of which Billy Dennis
was one of the builders, carrled on wlthout
any outslde assistance.
1 just feit that I would like honourable
senators te know that not only was Senator
Dennis a very able newspaper publisher i
the Maritimes but he also heiped build a
national news agency which operates from
one end of this country to the other.
The Hon. the Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
left the Chair.
Hon. Thomas Vien, P.C., in the Chair.
Han. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I would be most reluctant te Jet
this opportunity pass without paying my personal tribute to an old friend, a distinguished
member of this house, a great Nova Scotian
and a kindly and generous man.
The late Senator Dennis and I roomed
together in the oid Y.M.C.A. in Halifax over
forty years ago. Even then, as a young newspaper man, he displayed the energy and
keenness of mind that was to lead him to the

SENATE
greatest prominence. Seriously ill a few
years ago he, by sheer will-power, made such
a steady recovery that his many friends were
increasingly hopeful that he would long be
spared to his family and country.
Those who have known him only in recent
years may not fully appreciate the boundless
energy and great enthusiasm he displayed in
every endeavour with which he was associated. When be came to this house twenty
years ago he threw himself into its work with
the greatest interest. He was an ardent,
intense and patriotic Nova Scotian. Every
project for the public's welfare found in him
an enthusiastie supporter. He never turned
a deaf ear to requests for support. But perhaps more than all this, it will be the countless deeds of kindness and thoughtfulness to
those individuals in need which will do most
to keep his memory ever green. Each of his
friends knew of some-none knew of all.
May I extend my sincerest sympathy to his
widow, son and daughter in their great
bereavement.
Even now I fancy his spirit has winged
its way to his native province and will hover
ever and anon over his hill-top home at
Princeport, from which vantage point our late
colleague watched with unceasing and untiring interest the restless tides of old Fundy.
The Hon. the Speaker resumed the Chair.
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: Honourable
senators, as I have sat here listening with
appreciation to the many fine and deserving
tributes paid to our late colleague, I realize
that there is little more that I can add.
However, it occurred to me that the outstanding feature of the late senator's life
and the word which might be said to characterize his whole career is "service".
Whether in public or private service he gave
his best unreservedly, to his employer and
associates. His service to his employer in the
initial stages of his career was reflected in
his later accomplishments, in developing a
first-rate newspaper and business organization. On the public side, where he will be
longest remembered, his devotion and endeavour on behalf of underprivileged and less
fortunate folk will provide an inspiration to
everyone who admires a generous heart.
Race, creed, colour or religion were of no
concern to Senator Dennis. To him all were
equal. The full story of this kind and generous spirit and his devotion to charitable and
educational institutions, will never be fully
known. He loved the people for whom he
did so much, and in turn enjoyed their love
and respect throughout his career. A life of
service to his city, his province and his country has now reached its end. This house

has lost a valuable member, Canada a great
citizen, and Nova Scotia a distinguished son,
whose generosity, courage and devotion to
duty will long be an inspiration to those who
follow him.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable members,
so much has been said about our late colleague the Hon. William Dennis, that there
is very little left for me to say by way of
tribute to his memory; but, having known him
longer than any man in this chamber, I feel
I should add a word or two.
I knew "Billy" Dennis when he came to
Halifax in short pants and went into the
office of his uncle, the former Senator W. A.
Dennis. As has been mentioned, he worked
himself up from the lowly positions of elevator
boy and printer's devil to be the owner and
manager of the greatest newspaper in the
Maritime Provinces. He will leave his mark
in the Senate as the first chairman of the
Tourist Traffic Committee, and to him in
great measure is due the success we have
made of the tourist business in this country.
But Billy Dennis will chiefly be known in
our home in the Maritime Provinces for
his countless charities. His name is linked
with every charity in Halifax and in my
native province. I need only mention Rainbow Haven, which through his initiative was
established as a summer colony for underprivileged boys and girls; and the Good
Fellows' Club, which was started, mainly
through his efforts, to provide meals during
the Christmas season for the poor families of
Halifax. Countless other benefactions of his
will never be known, because, in the true
spirit of charity, his left hand knew not
what his right hand was giving.
I join with those who have already spoken
in tendering -sympathy to his widow, his son
and his daughter.
THE LATE FORMER SENATOR BARNARD
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. Nancy Hodges: Honourable senators,
I have no desire to prolong the rather melancholy mood in which the passing of two
members of this distinguished body has left us
this evening, but I feel that this is a proper
time to make brief reference to the passing
of one who was a former member of this
house. I refer to ex-Senator George Henry
Barnard, who was my predecessor here.
Ex-Senator Barnard died last week; and
in his passing British Columbia has lost a
native son of whom she had every reason to
be proud. The late senator was born in
Victoria eighty-five years ago. He came of one

Under the terms of the agreement now
before the house, the balance also will not

quarter-yearly instalments.
On this basis
the loan will be repaid in full on December 1,
1958. The purpose of the present bill is to
obtain the confirmation by parliament of the
agreement. The bill has been passed in the
other place.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How does the honourable gentleman justify the provision not to
charge interest?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In 1942, when the
loan was made, it was provided that interest
would not be charged, and when-in 1945 or
thereabouts-the agreement relating to the
loan was renewed, it was agreed that interest
would not be charged on the balance then
due. The debt is now reduced to $150 million, and it is felt that, in relation to this
comparatively small sum, it would be well
to continue the arrangement not to charge
interest.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall not delay the house
long. I agree with the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
think that all of us can assent to the provisions of the bill. I have a clear recollection of
the occasion in 1942 when this loan was
originally made, but as the facts have been
explained very fully by the leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), I shall not repeat them. I rise
merely to suggest that it might be advisable
to refer the bill to the Banking and Commerce

Committee. I should also like to suggest
that officers of the Department of Finance
attend the committee meeting and be prepared to give information on the present status
of other outstanding loans. I recall that
following the first World War, some thirtyfive years ago, Canada made substantial loans
to Romania and Italy. I have little hope that
it can be reported to us that much has been
paid on either of those loans or ever will be,
but I think some particulars would prove
interesting to honourable members. No doubt
we could get this information by an examination of the Public Accounts, but most members of parliament are not so much disposed
to study the Public Accounts as they were in
days gone by. It would be useful, at any
rate, to have the information in capsule
form.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am in full accord
with the suggestion of the honourable member
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). As sponsor of this bill I have no objection to its
being referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Honourable

PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN

PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY-

SECOND READING

Hon. William H. Taylor moved the second
reading of Bill R-5, an Act respecting Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, having
moved the second reading 'of this bill it is
my duty to explain it to the house and give
honourable senators some facts with respect
to it. The purpose of the bill is to grant
authority to the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company to build a line of railway fifteen
miles in length from a point near Havelock,
Ontario, northerly to Nephton, Ontario. Parliamentary authority is required because
under section 183 of the Railway Act a railway company may not construct a branch line
longer than six miles without such authority.
Havelock is a divisional point on one of
the Canadian Pacific main lines, between
Montreal and Toronto. It is approximately
midway between Toronto and Smiths Falls,
on what is known as the Peterborough line.
Nephton is the site of the operations of
American Nepheline Limited, a mining company controlled by Ventures Limited. The

JANUARY 26, 1954
company employs one hundred and fifty persons, one hundred and twenty-five of whom
live at Nephton.
American Nepheline
Limited was incorporated in 1945, under the
Ontario Companies Act, to take over the
operations of American Nepheline Corporation, a New York company.
At Nephton the company produces nepheline syenite, which is a rock formation somewhat resembling granite in texture, hardness
and general appearance. Nepheline syenite
is used in the manufacture of glass and pottery. Production of nepheline syenite at
Nephton has been continuous since 1935. In
1952, 77 per cent of the shipments of nepheline syenite went to the United States, while
20 per cent went to Canadian points and 3
per cent went to Porto Rico, Panama and
to Europe.
Prior to 1946 the crude rock ore was shipped to Rochester, New York, for milling. In
1946 the company established a grinding mill
at Lakefield, Ontario, twenty-four miles by
road from Nephton, and thereafter the product was milled at Lakefield before being
shipped. In 1947 a new mill was built at
Nephton, and since that time additions have
been made to it.
At present it is necessary for the company
to transport the product by truck over a
secondary development road from Nephton
to Lakefield, a distance of twenty-four miles.
This road is maintained entirely at the
expense of the company, and transportation
by truck not only involves loss of the product when finely ground but is also uncertain
when the road becomes impassable because
of weather conditions. Construction of the
proposed line will permit the company to
centralize all its operations at Nephton, and
thus reduce costs and improve efficiency.

83280--13

The proposed line of railway from
Havelock to Nephton would cost approximately $1,500,000. Construction of the line
has been a matter of discussion and negotiation between the Canadian Pacific Railway
and the company for some time; and an
agreement has recently been reached for construction of the line and payment of the cost.
The divisional facilities which at present exist
at Havelock are well adapted to give expeditious service to cars moving to and from
Nephton.
The ore reserves at Nephton are estimated
at over 3 million tons and have not as yet
been fully explored. It is considered that at
the present level of production the known and
reasonably assured reserve will be sufficient
to maintain production for twenty years.
Both the Canadian Pacific Railway and the
company are convinced that the proposal is
well worth while, and they are anxious that
approval of the bill be given as soon as
possible so that construction of the line may
be commenced early in the spring of 1954.
I commend the bill to this honourable
bouse, and if it is favourably considered I
would then move that it be referred to an
appropriate committee, where representatives
of the company can explain their plans,
answer questions, and furnish any information the committee desires.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Taylor, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on

JANUARY 27, 1954
He said: Honourable senators, this bil has
to do with the government of the Northwest
Territories. Honourable members who have
read the bill probably found, as I did, an
apparent confusion, because what we are
doing here is amending two separate acts ini
this one measure, ail of which has to do with
the governrnent of the Northwest Territories.
A word of explanat ion might be in order
here. The present Northwest Territories Act
is found in chapter 195 of the Revised Statutes
of Canada, 1952. Another act dealing with
the Northwest Territories is to be found
in chapter 331 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1952. The latter act is to corne into
effect on proclamation after the new Criminal
Code becomes operative; but, as honourable
members know, the code is stili in progress
through parliament. I believe some doubt
has arisen lately as to whether parliament
will be able to complete revision of the code
at this session; and I arn advised that after it
has passed parliament, from six months to a
year xviii elapse before it is finally proclaimed, for the reason that a great many
new forms will have to be prepared, printed
and distributed to prosecuting officers ail over
Canada.
With that word of explanation, it rnay be
interesting to look for a moment at the process of the development of self-government in
our local -authorities thr'oughout Canada. The
provisions of this act follow very closely the
development of self-government from. the
beginning of the history of our country. But
possibly the most interesting analogy for
honourable members to study can be found
in the developrnent of what, eighty-five years
ago, were known as the Northwest Territories in Canada. It will be recalled that at the
time of Confederation ail the great western
country lying between the Rocky Mountains
and Hudson's Bay, and even beyond, was
under the control of the Hudson's Bay
Company, that famous company that had its
origin in the gentlemen adventurers who
were authorized by charter to trade into Hudson's Bay away back about two hundred and
eighty-five years ago.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: 1670.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It was part of the understan ding under which. Confederation was
brought about that this vast dornain would
cease to be under the control of the company
and would become part of the public domain
of Canada. It was necessary then for the
existing government at Ottawa to provide for
government in the new territory, and so, in
1869, even before the transfer had taken
place, a provision was made whereby a lieutenant governor was appointed, with an
appointive council, to adxninister the affairs
83280-13J

of what then became known as the Northwest
Territories. In 1870 a smail segment of the
terrîtories was erected into what becarne the
province of Manitoba.
In 1871 a further enactment provided that
in the outlying terrîtories there should be a
lieutenant governor and an appointive council of not less than seven and not more than
fifteen members. The next step appears to
have been taken in 1880, when the then Northwest Territories Act was amended so as to
bring about representation through the elective process. The effect of that arnendment
was that in an area of not more than one
thousand square miles and containing not
less than one thousand white population the
lieutenant governor could set up a constituency and provide for the election of a member
to the Northwest Territories Council. There
was a further provision that when the Northwest Territories Council had reached in nurnber twenty-one elected members, the old
appointive council would cease to operate,
and the twenty-one elected members would
become a legisiative assernbly under the lieutenant governor, with power to levy taxes,
administer iaw in the territory, and exercise
ail the other functions of local governrnent.
It will be borne in mind that during ail this
time the decîsions of the council-first when
it was appointive, later when it was partially
appointive and partiaily elective, and laVer
stili when it became the legisiative assembly
-were subi ect to review by the federal government at Ottawa, which had powers of disallowance, just as it has today over provincial
statutes.
It is not necessary to say anything about
the Pacific coast, as it is not germane to the
discussion of this particular measure. Neyertheless, I might mention that it becarne a
colony first in about 1850-I arn looking across
at my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) and wondering if
my facts in this respect are correct-and a
governor was sent out from Britain. For a
time his advisers were appointed, but laVer
they were elected.
With that brief explanation, rnay I say
that the development now taking place in the
government of the Northwest Territories f ollows very closely the analogy that I have
just related to the house. The bill before us
provides for several changes in the existing
legisiation.
At the present time the Northwest Territories Council consists of eight members. Four
of these are appointed, and tbree elected, the
remaining mnember-the head of the counilbeing the Commissioner for the Northwest
Territories, who is the Deputy Minister of the
Department of Nortbern Affairs and National

SENATE
Resources. When the present measure was
under consideration in the other house a
suggestion that the elective portion of the
council be increased was adopted, and under
subsection 1 of section 2 of the bill the council will consist of nine members, four of
whom shall be elected.
The next change proposed by the bill
may arouse some curiosity, but nevertheless
it has a very good reason behind it. The
present term of office of the Northwest
Territories Council is three years. The bill
provides that the Governor in Councilthat is the government here in Ottawamay, after the expiration of two years from
the return of the writs of election of the
elected members of the council, dissolve the
The
council and have a new election.
explanation is, I understand, that only at
certain times of the year is it practicable to
hold an election for the council in the Northwest Territories, and this amendment would
ensure the holding of elections at those
times.
Another change, of minor consequence, is
in the time within which copies of ordinances
passed by the council shall be transmitted
to Ottawa. The period has been extended
from ten days to thirty days.
Then there are certain provisions with
regard to the control of reindeer herds, provisions which are already incorporated in
chapter 331 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
but are not at present effective because that
statute is not yet operative, so that they
are included in this bill. They require no
explanation beyond saying that the Governor
in Council may transfer, under regulation
for direction and supervision, to certain
Eskimos, small herds of reindeer, and also
make effective provisions against the decimation of reindeer by hunters or others. Both
as respects the sale of products from the
deer, and the use of them by Eskimos, closer
supervision is provided for. That, I think, is
a very wise provision.
The next point I wish to bring forward
relates to a matter which at the moment is,
possibly, of some interest to honourable
senators; that is, the remuneration of members of the council for the services they
render. The present provision is, I think,
an allowance of $15 per day for living expenses while meetings of the council are
being held. By the new section this allowance is to be increased to a maximum of $25,
to apply only to the days that a member is
in attendance at a council meeting. His
travelling expenses, including his living
expenses while in the course of his journeys,
are otherwise .provided for. Under the old
legislation the maximum annual allowance

was $200. That limitation is removed. As
a rule, meetings of the council last three to
four days; rarely, I am advised, any longer.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Where are they held?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: At various places. I might
give some details on this point. In 1951, when
the council was set up, the first meeting was
at Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories,
and lasted from December 10 to December 13.
The second session was held at Ottawathere being a provision in the legislation that
the council may meet in this city-and that
meeting continued from July 2 to July 10,
1952. The third meeting took place at Fort
Smith, from December 8 to December 11 in
the same year. The next council meeting was
at Yellowknife, and lasted from June 25 to
June 30, 1953. I understand that recently
another meeting was held here in Ottawa.
It might be appropriate to mention the
personnel of the council. As I have already
stated, the Commissioner is Mr. R. G.
Robertson, Deputy Minister of the department which is now known as Northern
Affairs and National Resources. Mr. F. J. G.
Cunningham, who is one of the officers of
the department having to do with far
northern administration, is Deputy Commissioner. The other members are Mr. L. C.
Audette, a member of the Maritime Commission; Air Commander W. I. Clements, who
is with the National Defence Department;
Mr. Jean Boucher, attached to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration; and
Commissioner L. H. Nicholson, of the Northwest Mounted Police. These gentlemen constitute the appointed members of the council.
The elected members are: Mr. James Brady,
of Fort Smith, representing the constituency
of Mackenzie South; Mr. Frank Carmichael,
of Aklavik, representing the district of
Mackenzie West; and Mr. M. A. Hardie, of
Yellowknife, representing Mackenzie North.
As many honourable senators know, Mr.
Hardie resigned from the council to contest,
at the last federal election, the riding of
Mackenzie. He was elected, and now sits in
the House of Commons; so at the moment
Mackenzie North is unrepresented on the
council.
Another clause provides that when a member of the council resigns, or dies, the government may appoint a substitute rather than
call for a new election. The carrying out of
elections in this far northern country is a
rather expensive business, and since the term
of office is for only three years it seems
reasonable not to take strong exception to
this provision.
Another provision authorizes the Commissioner in Council to make agreements with
the federal government. These agreements

because the meat is being sold. Anybody
can buy reindeer meat; I buy it myself.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A certain number of them
are lost each year, but the total herd is
increasing. I think the hospitals at Aklavik
and at Fort Norman are very largely supplied
with reindeer meat, which is much less
expensive than beef. I observed in the notes
before me that some of the skins or hides
taken from these animals have been sent
farther east to Eskimos who have no reindeer.
This is all part of the development of the
economy arising out of the propagation of
reindeer herds.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? What possible
connection can there be between the coming
into force of chapter 331 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada and the coming into force
of the new Criminal Code? I am just a little
curious. Why is one act tied to the other?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This legislation will govern. My honourable friend will notice that
we are proposing to amend both chapter 195
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, which is
the existing Northwest Territories Act, and
also chapter 331, which, however, is not
operative at the moment. When the proposed
Criminal Code becomes operative and chapter 331 is proclaimed, chapter 195 will go out
the window.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But what is the connection between the Criminal Code and chapter 331? I may be slow in the uptake, but I
cannot see how the two are tied together.
Why does chapter 331 come into effect only
when the new Criminal Code is proclaimed?
Chapter 331 should come into force when
the statutes are proclaimed.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am afraid I cannot fully
answer that question. It was one that I
feared might be asked!
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It has to do in some way
with the code, which, frankly, not being a
lawyer, I do not understand. When the bill
goes to committee I am quite certain that the
Law Clerk of the Senate will provide the
necessary enlightenment for any member to
whom it is not clear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was just curious.
But I do want to make an observation in
connection with this bill. I remember that
when the bill which is now chapter 331 was
before this house a discussion arose during
the debate as to the constitution of the
Northwest Territories Council. I expressed
disappointment at the very slow rate of

speed on the part of the government in
bringing about self-government of these
people. I note that there are now five civil
servants on the council, and only three
elected members, with one vacant seat. I
wrote down the names of the appointees.
They are leading members of our various
departments, two being from the controlling
department, one from the Department of
Citizenship, an air commander, and, finally,
the head of the Northwest Mounted Police.
These men, five in all, of high standing, of
course, are no doubt of great influence, with
forceful personalities. Then I see the three
little elected
representatives, apparently
about as influential as a fly in a bucket of
milk, with all the weight of these civil
servants against them. I should think that
the people of the Northwest Territories would
take serious objection to rule from Ottawa;
because apparently the elected representatives
are just a gesture, and their influence does
not amount to anything. How can they
possibly have any real influence in a council
of that kind?
I do hope that the honourable gentleman's
prognostication that it will be a long time
before real self-government comes to these
people is unduly pessimistic. The slowness
with which we are handling self-government
in the Northwest Territories is somewhat
reminiscent of the attitude adopted at Westminster towards us in the early days, when
it was thought that we benighted colonists
did not have intelligence enough to run our
own affairs and those very wise and very
important people at Westminster had to tell
us how to manage Canada. At that time
we were able to take charge of our ?own
affairs, as we proved in later days. I do not
suppose we are any wiser than our fathers
were, but today no one would think of
coming over here even to advise us how to
manage our own affairs, much less to bully
us or push us about. I rather fancy that
that old attitude is maintained by the Civil
Service and the Government of Canada
towards these outlying districts.
I once
lived in a sparsely settled part of the north,
and I found that people there possessed as
much common sense as those in larger
communities.
I think we are moving much too slowly
in giving really representative government
to the Northwest Territories, and I wanted
to record these statements in connection with
the bill, as I did when the bill which is now
chapter 331 was before this house about two
years ago. I sincerely hope that my friend's
words are unduly pessimistic, and that
greater progress than he anticipates will be
made in extending self-government to the
Northwest Territories.

DEFENCE ESTABLISHMENTS AND
PLANTS
VISITS BY MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, it might be appropriate to say
a few words in the Senate with reference to
visits which were made by a number of
members of both houses to certain installations of the armed services and to plants
dedicated to the production of equipment for
the Canadian defence program in the Montreal area. These visits were arranged by the
Minister and the Associate Minister of
National Defence, and they took place on the
24th of November, 1953, and on the 27th of
January of this year. About fifty members of
parliament attended each event. We saw in
the first instance the installation at the Air
Defence Command Headquarters near Montreal. That establishment is in charge of Air
Vice-Marshal A. L. James. We had some considerable discussion with him and his officers
on some of the problems of air defence in this
country, and we saw a very magnificent and,
I perhaps might add, a somewhat terrifying
fiying display by F-86 Sabre Jets and by
CF-100 planes of the Royal Canadian Air
Force.
We also had the privilege of visiting No. 25
Central Ordnance Depot at Longue Pointe,
which establishment is under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel G. E. Shannon. We saw
a similar establishment operated by the
Department of National Defence for the Naval
Service at Ville La Salle, under the command
of Commander J. R. Anderson. Both these
officers and all officers on their staffs did
everything that it was possible to do to make
the visit of the members of both houses of
parliament to those establishments interesting
and enjoyable.
We also had the privilege of visiting two
plants engaged in the production of war
materials for the country. One was Canadian Vickers Limited, on the Montreal waterfront. There we were received by Colonel
O. H. Barrett, president of the company, and
many of his officers and other officials, as
well as by the naval service officers who
work there in liaison between the Department
of National Defence, naval branch, and the
company. At that plant they are building
destroyer escort craft, frigates, minesweepers,
and they are doing a very fine kind of job of
naval construction in this country.
I must say, from my own personal point
of view, it was most reassuring to see this;
because as all honourable members know so

SENATE
well, the development and operation of a
naval service in a country is only as good
as the naval building program that is behind
it. There has been some tremendous development of the naval building program in this
country since the days of the late war.
We also had the privilege of visiting the
facilities of Canadair Limited just outside of
Montreal, and there our visit was in charge
of the president of the company, Mr. J. G.
Notman. As honourable senators know, it
is there that the F-86 and T-33 aircraft are
built. The company is doing a splendid
job in the aircraft industry of Canada.
The occasion of these visits provided members of parliament with an opportunity to see,
to understand, to discuss, and I think, in a
modest way, to make some assessment of the
work involved in carrying out the country's
defence plans. We were given some idea of
the problems encountered in these plants and
the methods employed in their solution. I
think, too, we had some opportunity of assessing the effect upon the national economy, at
least in that part of the country and perhaps
in many parts of the country, of those particular industries which we saw.
Honourable senators, this is not the time
or place to discuss conclusions, but on behalf
of the representatives of both houses of
parliament who visited these establishments
and plants I know I may say that we are
most grateful for the opportunities which
were afforded us to see what we did.
Our
thanks are due, firstly, to the Minister of
National Defence, the Honourable Brooke
Claxton, and the Associate Minister, the Honourable Ralph O. Campney, and secondly to
the members of the Royal Canadian Air Force
who provided very efficient and comfortable
transportation-and to provide transportation
at all in yesterday's weather was a sign of
efficiency. To the personnel of ail three
branches of the armed services, the navy, the
army and the air force, who were very good
and most generous in what they did,
we are most grateful. Finally, to the officials of the two companies, Vickers and Canadair, we express our thanks for the information and explanations which they gave, for
their carefully arranged schedules and last,
but certainly not least, for their hospitality.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
CRIMINAL CODE
JOINT COMMITTEE ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS OF
CRIMINAL LAW-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
a message from the House of Commons
regarding the appointing of a joint committee
of both houses of parliament to inquire into

and report upon the questions whether the
criminal law of Canada relating to (a) capital punishment, (b) corporal punishment or
(c) lotteries, should be amended in any
respect and, if so, in what manner and to
what extent.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators will note from the content of this resolution that it is proposed to give special
study to the subjects set forth in the
resolution, namely capital punishment, corporal punishment and lotteries, ail of which
come within the provisions of the Criminal
Code. It might perhaps be in order for me
to review briefly the steps that have been
taken over the past few years with respect
to the Criminal Code.
In 1949 an examination and study of the
code was authorized by Order in Council No.
527, and the task of preparing a new consolidation was assigned to a commission consisting of the Honourable Mr. Justice W. M.
Martin, Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, as
chairman, the Honourable Mr. Justice J. H. G.
Fauteux and Mr. F. P. Varcoe, Q.C., Deputy
Minister of Justice. The commission was to
have the assistance of a committee representative of the country's outstanding legal
talent. Subsequently, however, some members of the commission and also of the committee found that other duties, on the Bench
or in private practice, prevented them from
giving the necessary time to the work.
In 1951, therefore, a second commission
was set up, again under the chairmanship
of Chief Justice Martin, and on Jaunary 22,
1952 it submitted to the government its final
report, together with a bill which it had
drafted and which constituted a draft Criminal Code Consolidation Bill.
Honourable senators will recall that on
May 12, 1952, that bill, known as Bill H-8,
was introduced in this house, and on May
15 it was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. The committee
appointed a subcommittee, which under the
able chairmanship of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), examined the bill clause by clause. Honourable
members are aware of the prodigious amount
of work which this subcommittee devoted to
the bill. Its study was continued until the
end of the 1952 session; and although, I
understand, the committee met four or five
times a week, so thoroughgoing were its
deliberations that it was unable to conclude
its work before parliament adjourned.
During the summer of 1952, as a result of
the discussions in the house and by the committee, certain changes in the proposed bill
were made by the Department of Justice, and

JANUARY 28, 1954
the bill, thus altered, was introduced as Bill the appointment of a royal commission, or to the

unable to spare the time to do the necessary
work. That is quite understandable. The
membership of the special committee which
was later appointed to assist the commission
was made up largely of crown prosecutors
and other such officials. The standpoint of a
crown prosecutor in relation to an enactment
of this kind is understandable, and honourable, and inevitably his views will be
reflected in the proposed legislation. When
this bill came to the Senate I had the honour
to serve for one week on the subcommittee
which examined it clause by clause. It seems
that after one week I was considered to be
too busy with other matters to bc further
called upon, and I think in this decision the
committee used good judgment. However, in
that short week I could see that the legislation had been drafted from the point of
view of crown prosecutors. I do not say this
in an offensive way, for I would probably
have done just as they did had I been in
their position. When a person is drafting
legislation his training in life, whatever it
may be, is bound to have an effect on the
legislation. Excepting myself, the membership
of the Senate subcommittee consisted largely
of distinguished lawyers who have devoted a
great deal of time to litigation, and frequently,
I believe, have appeared on behalf of the
defence. Naturally, they often find themselves opposed to ideas held by officials of
the crown prosecutor type. I have in mind
one of these, a prosecuting counsel from the
Department of Justice, a very able man-he
comes from my province!
Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He is a lawyer of great
experience, and is now again in practice in
one of the largest firms in Winnipeg. He
showed, quite properly, the reactions one
would expect.
I think the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) made a contribution to the
Criminal Code which will never be appreciated in proportion to its worth. I know
that when a senator is on a committee he
does good work; but the four gentlemen I
have referred to worked as though life or
death depended on their efforts. They dotted
every "i" and crossed every "t", so to speak.
I admit that sometimes one man's opinion
would conflict with another's, but whenever
I was there they stayed with the job until
they got a unanimous decision. Those gentlemen have made a great contribution to the
law-an achievement so great that when the

bill came before the House of Commons for
second reading, that house adopted almost ail
the amendments made by our original committee.
It is, I think, to the credit of the Minister
of Justice and this house that the criminal
law has been codified in its present form. The
task was long overdue.
People have complained to me because
the statutes are not revised every fifteen or
twenty years. In my province the revision
is made, I think, every twenty years. The
latest Revised Statutes of Canada are those
-of 1952, the first since 1927-in other words,
there was no revisIon for twenty-five years.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was on account
of the war.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that there are
always good reasons for any delay. At the
same time, practising lawyers and their
clients are entitled to a reasonably frequent
revision of the law, and I think the maximum period of time for revisions of the Code
should be twenty years. I say that because
amendments have to be made from time to
time. Law is a growing thing. Some people
think otherwise, but the law does grow.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: In Saskatchewan there
is a revision every ten years.
Hon. Mr. I-iaig: That is too often, because
lawyers then have to buy law books too
frequently. I think twenty years should be
the maximum, though.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The same as in
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable Leader of
the Government did me the compliment of
saying that he would like to include me in
the committee. I have two reasons for not
accepting. First, I have not the physical
strength, and I do not want to put to the
test what strength I have. Secondly, I think
I would go there with prejudices, which I
doubt that I would get over.
I think
members of the committee will find difficulty
in overcoming their preconceived views.
I do not know of any better way of dealing with the special subjects of the criminal
law that have been mentioned than the way
that has been suggested here. I do not
intend to discuss any of these matters on
their merits at present.
I heartily support the resolution. The
Leader o! the Government did me the honour
of allowing me to see the names be has suggested, and I approved of them. I believe
they will give fine service and be a credit
to this house, as all committees of the Senate
have been since I first came here.

JANUARY 28, 1954
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have all been a credit
to this chamber; and I am not a bit afraid
that any member appointed by the other
house to the proposed joint committee will
be able to teach the representatives of this
house anything about the law.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
rise to make what is perhaps a slight
criticism, and also a suggestion. I too was
a member of the Banking and Commerce
Committee by which the Code was considered at two previous sessions. A very
strong subcommittee of prominent and able
lawyers was appointed to consider the bill
in detail, and brought in its report. They
did a splendid job. I am not a lawyer
myself, fortunately-or perhaps unfortunately, I am not sure which-but I want to
compliment them. I have no fault whatsoever to find with the list of senators suggested by the leader as representatives of
this bouse on the joint committee. However,
I do think that for the purpose of considering the merits of capital punishment, corporal punishment, or lotteries, the lawyers
in parliament are not any better equipped
than other members.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps the lawyers are
not quite so well equipped. As was said by
my friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), some of them have the prosecuting
attorney'sHon. Mr. Haig: Frame of mind.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think I shall have the
support of most people when I say that no
technical knowledge of law is required to
consider the merits of capital punishment,
corporal punishment, or even lotteries. I do
not suggest that the prominent lawyers should
be displaced from the committee, but rather
that some members of this chamber should
be included-and in this of course I am not
excepting the lawyers here-who have some
common sense with regard to these matters.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am asking that some
members be included who would not have
to rely on their technical knowledge of fine
points of the law. I believe that one of the
suggested members is not of the legal profession; I think the proportion of those who
do not belong to that esteemed profession
might be made a little larger.

revision of the Criminal Code was a splendid
one. On the one hand, men holding high
government office represented the prosecutor's point of view; on the other hand were
lawyers experienced in presenting the point
of view of the defence.
We all have our views regarding corporal
punishment, hanging, and lotteries. One does
not need a training in law in order to form
opinions upon these matters. If I am not in
agreement with the set-up of the joint committee, it is not because I want to be put
on the committee myself. But I want to
make one suggestion to the committee. It
has been suggested that if a committee
should be set up by parliament for the purpose of studying the merits or demerits of
capital punishment, its members should visit
a place of execution to see a convicted
person put to death for the commission of
his crime-the assumption being that the
sight of the execution would influence the
members to oppose capital punishment. I
suggest that if the joint committee decides
that it is good business to visit a hanging,
its members should afterwards visit the scene
of the crime, because it would be too bad if
they did not see the son or daughter, or
husband or wife of the person who had been
brutally put to death. Don't let it be all
one-sided. If the committee is going to
witness the gruesome sight of the execution,
let it be sure to go to the home that has
been bereaved before ever it starts to pass
judgment or make recommendations regarding the death penalty.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the debate
was adjourned.

THE LATE SENATOR HUSHION
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before we proceed with the Orders of
the Day may I make a few remarks in
respect to the late Senator Hushion. Since
we last met, as honourable senators have
learned, the Honourable Senator William
James Hushion of Montreal passed away, on
Friday of last week. With his passing went
one of the most colourful political figures in
the history of his native city. Senator
Hushion was born in Montreal on November
6, 1883, a son of Daniel Hushion and Margaret Phelan, and received his early education at St. Patrick's and St. Ann's schools.
His political career began at an early age,
for he became an alderman of Montreal in
1913, and he held a seat on the council of that
city until 1927. But Senator Hushion's political activity was not confined to the municipal
arena. In 1923 he was elected a member of
the Quebec legislature, and a year later won
the federal riding of St. Antoine, which he
held until 1930. In the general elections of
that year, however, he was defeated, but in
1935 was re-elected by that riding to the
House of Commons; and in 1940 he was summoned to the Senate.
Our late colleague was an outstanding figure
DIVORCE BILLS
in his community, in its business as well as
FIRST READINGS
its political life. He was President of the
Hon. Mr. Roebuck, Chairman of the Stand- Montreal Transfer Terminal Limited, a direcing Committee on Divorce, presented the tor of Hushion and Hushion Limited, President of Seven Industries Limited, a director

career he maintained a keen interest in wel'are and social endeavour in his city, and was
a director of both St. Mary's and Notre Dame
hospitals.
Senator Hushion will be missed not only
in this chamber, but also by his friends and
associates in the city of Montreal. I am sure
that honourable senators would wish to join
with me in extending to his widow and children our deepest sympathy in the great loss
which they have sustained.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
there is very little I can add to what has
been said by the honourable leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on the
passing of our esteemed colleague Senator
Hushion. I should like to join the leader in
the tribute he has paid to the late senator.
Although I have been a member of this
house throughout the time Senator Hushion
was with us, I perhaps was not as well
acquainted with him as I should have been.
But I knew of his record in Montreal, where
he was prominent not only in municipal and
provincial matters, but in dominion affairs.
He was a quiet, unobtrusive member of this
house, but was always on hand when the
votes were counted, and he took his stand
on all matters as he saw fit.
I join with the leader of the government in
expressing to his family the sincere sympathy
of all members of this house.
Honourable
Hon. Charles B. Howard:
senators, I should like to join with the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
and the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) in an expression of respect to the
memory of our departed colleague.
Senator Hushion, better known to those of
us who come from Quebec as "Billy", was
an outstanding figure in that province, representing as he did an important class of its
citizens. He was a quiet, unassuming gentleman, with strong convictions of his own but
holding great respect for the opinions of
other people. Above all else he was a great
family man, with strong home ties. He had a
loving and friendly disposition, and I never
heard anyone speak disrespectfully of him.
He married young, and had three children,
two boys and a girl. As has been mentioned,
early in life he began to serve his fellow
men. He was first elected to the city council
of Montreal at twenty-nine years of age, and

served for fourteen years as a member of
the council of that great metropolis. He was
then elected to the legislature of Quebec,
but resigned after only a year to stand for
parliament, and was elected. Although defeated in 1930, he was re-elected in 1935.
He became a member of the Senate in February, 1940, exactly six days after my own
appointment ta this honourable house.
He was a director of two of Montreal's
hospitals, and was known throughout his
constituency and the city at large for his
charitable gifts and activities.
I knew Billy as a colleague through the
years that he sat in the House of Commons;
I was associated with him in political fights
in his own constituency and in other ridings
in the city of Montreal; and I am here to
pay my respects to a splendid, kindly, homeloving gentleman. I join with those who
have spoken in extending sympathy to his
devoted wife; to his daughter, Mrs. Farrell;
and to his two sons, Donald and Jack.
Hon. J. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators, as a member from far-away British
Columbia, and one who had the pleasure of
knowing the late Bill Hushion for many
years, I wish to add a word to what has
been said about him. At his funeral in
Montreal today I noticed that, though references were made to his political record and
his business career, what seemed to have
most deeply impressed the average person
who knew him was that his life exemplified
the essence of Christian charity. I am sure
that there are many people in the parts of
Montreal where he lived or which he represented on various public bodies whose lives
have been bettered and whose concepts of
life itself have been raised through the
principles of Christian charity practised by
the late Bill Hushion.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as a further mark of respect to our late
colleague I would move, as soon as the items
on the Order Paper have been called, that
this house do adjourn.
ADJOURNMENT
On the Orders of the Day:

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE-QUESTION 0F
PRIVILEGE

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called 1
should like to rise on a question of privilege
on a matter affecting myseif.
The Montreal Gazette, in its issue of February 1, carried an article under the caption
"Execution", which purportedly deait with
some remarks I made in the Senate chamber
on January 28. The article reads as follows:
The government hasn't, as yet, indicated its view
with respect ta the NATO tour proposai. Meanwhile, the Senate was pondering a proposed tour af
another sort. The upper house. at the trne, wvas
naming eight senators to a jioint Senate-Commons
committee which will report on whether the
Criminsi Code should be amended with respect to
capital punishment, corporal punishment and latteries. Senator Tom Reid (Lý-British Columbis) rose
to make a suggestion.
The joint committee's
deliberations respecting capital punishment would
be greatly aided. he believed, if "its members
should visit a place of execution to see a convicted
persan Put ta death for the commission of his
crime.,, His proposai clrewv some vocal support.
But it's unlikely that the trip will be made.

Honourable senators, I made no such proposai ýat ail. I did, however, draw attention
of the house to a suggestion that had been
made, namely, that the members of the
joint committee, if it is set up, should witness
an actual hanging, on the assumption that
they would thus be influenced to oppose
capital punishment.
Then my suggestion
was this: that if the members did decide ta
witness a hanging, they should afterwards
visit the scene of the crime or the hume of
the victim and see the close relatives of the
persan who had been brutally put ta death.
My point was that in that way the committee would have before it the whole picture, and not just -a picture of one side only
-the sentimental side.
May I ask that this mistake be corrected?

UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL
AGREEMENT BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the third
reading of Bill 78, an Act to approve the
financial agreement between Canada and the
United Kingdom, signed on the thirteenth
day of August, 1953.
He said: Honourable senators, I have
nothing to add to what I said on the second
reading. I think the bill has met with the
general approval of the members of this
house.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I do not rise to oppose the bill, but as I was

not in this chamber when it received second
reading, I want to use this occasion to make
some observations.
In one respect this bill is rather different
from those which are usually presented to
us, in that by it approval is asked for something which has already been done. The
subject-matter is an agreement between
Canada and the United Kingdom for the
immediate reduction of a loan made to the
Government of the United Kingdom, and the
repayment of the balance by instalments, all
of which, it is provided, shall be interestfree.
It is customary, and indeed necessary, in
matters of this kind that governments should
act before the consent of parliament, because
it is for governments to make policies and
to see to it that in so doing they are supported
by their party in parliament. This bill has
already passed the Commons, and the
thought occurred to me that, upon being
referred to this chamber, it comes into a
totally different atmosphere. We, of course,
judge bills on their merits, but we are also
able to consider them with more freedom than
the majority in the other place can, because,
should a government bill be defeated in the
Commons, the government is in peril, whereas if such a bill is rejected in this chamber
the future of the government is not thereby
affected. This fact makes for a certain continuity which is not evident in the other
place, and perhaps in this way the Senate
renders a stabilizing service which is not
generally recognized by the public. This
legislation does not create something new, its
purpose being as I have said, to obtain confirmation by parliament of an agreement that
has already been made. For this reason the
legislation before us is perhaps not as subject
to the scrutiny of parliament as new legislation would be.
It is not my purpose to criticize this bill,
but rather to urge the Senate to give-if I
may use some words that are on our parchment summonses-its "advice and assistance"
in such a "weighty and arduous" matter of
government. Incidentally, I think the Senate
should use this approach more often when
dealing with bills that come before it.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that a
transaction of this kind could be used to
actively improve affairs in both Canada and
the United Kingdom. The loan covered by
this agreement represents a small portion of
the loans Canada has made to the Mother
Country, and we learned in committee that
Canada has also made heavy loans to other
European countries in order to help them
sustain their economies. It is apparent that

FEBRUARY 3, 1954
the United Kingdom needs dollars. In the
past it was emphasized that the need was for
American dollars, but the Canadian dollar is
now the most valuable in the world, being
readily convertible into American dollars at a
premium of about 3 per cent. Therefore,
countries needing dollars would be well
advised to try to secure Canadian dollars.
On the other hand, Canada needs to expand
its trade. As a lightly populated country,
Canada must export a large percentage of
goods in order to provide full employment
and help to ensure a stable economy.
I believe that an expanding trade program
is vital to Canada at the present time, for we
are faced with a rather new condition. The
current high value of our dollar does not
tend to accelerate our export trade, but rather
creates an obstacle similar to a tariff barrier.
This is even true of our exports to the United
States of America. I can recall that when the
Canadian dollar was at a 10 per cent discount
with the American dollar, Canadian exporters
of natural products such as fish and lumber
found this exchange differential to be valuable. As a matter of fact, they could derive
almost a sufficient profit from the exchange
alone. However, as the Canadian dollar is
now at a premium it will become increasingly
difficult for countries using sterling currency
to buy our exports.
My impression is that if in some way we
could use our capital to improve conditions
for trading with such countries, it would be
to the advantage of the country. I have in
mind particularly present conditions in the
West Indies trade with Canada. The Maritime
provinces are, and always have been, very
much interested in trade with the West Indies.
Newfoundland also is interested. For some
years now we have been restricted in trade
with the West Indies because of customs
regulations and prohibitions, which in past
years, especially in the last decade, have
seriously affected the economy of the Maritime provinces. Our trade with those islands
was built up through many years and has
been considered a heritage of the Maritimes.
The West Indies have provided a good market
for our lumber, fish 'and farm products, and
this has tended to stimulate the activity of
our merchant marine. But suddenly, because
of world conditions, particularly conditions
in Great Britain, this trade stopped, and there
is now operating only what is called a token
import plan.
The West Indies, being tropical, have many
things we need. And Canada, being in the
temperate zone, is able to furnish the West
Indies with many things they need; but we

have usually bought from them more than
they bought from us. The United States has
within its borders temperate, tropical and
semi-tropical areas, and thus can produce
most of its own needs. In addition, it has
acquired tropical countries like Porto Rico
and the Virgin Islands; and it also has a
close tariff arrangement with Cuba, one of
the most fertile countries in the world.
Hawaii, a part of the United States, is also
tropical. These countries constitute for the
United States a very valuable trading area,
and we in Canada need to develop similar
facilities for trade. With regard to the bill
before us, my idea is that we should spend this
capital money with Britain to release trade
restrictions with the British West Indiesthat we should forget the debt, if necessary,
by investing it in trade. What our people
need is the activity that comes with trade,
and we should try to keep them employed by
trading in a natural market. The West
Indies are encircled by dollar countries which,
I think, could help to improve standards of
living by better trade and closer relations.
Just as a new office building or a factory is
no good unless you use it, so this capital
money that we put out on loan without
interest is not profitable unless it is put into
circulation for our benefit. The purpose in
building a factory is to create business and
give employment; and the function of money
is to cause activity and give work to our
people, and thereby help to build up a healthy
economy. Canada is in a position to supply
this capital need. Our money is extremely
valuable, and if it is used to supply this
capital need, activity in trade will be stimulated, work will be created and profits will
be made. That is certainly what we should
strive for.
So, if we made a capital investment by
cancelling loans, or even by the issue of
new money, I think it would be advantageous
to Canada and also help out Britain's need
for dollars. If this were done for the purpose
of creating trade with the West Indies,
I would commend it. It would be advantageous not only to Nova Scotia and the other
Maritime provinces and Newfoundland, but
to the whole of Canada, for the West Indies
use a lot of flour and other products that
come from various parts of Canada. I think
we can all agree that here is trade that is
eminently desirable in the interests of the
whole of Canada. This, in part, was what
happened when Newfoundland came into
Confederation; we took on obligations, we
made a capital investment, and we obtained
a lot of new citizens, together with their
trade. Everybody thinks it was a splendid

SENATE

investment, to the benefit of both Newfoundland and the rest of Canada. There are
always two sides to a bargain, and I think
this one was beneficial to both sides.
My suggestion is that Canada should have
economic free trade with the West Indiesthe British West Indies especially. We are
trying to do all we can to encourage trade
with the Mother Country. I have in mind
the British preference, apart altogether from
the many millions of dollars that we have
on loan to our friends over there. By means
of the British preference we invite trade
with Canada. The provisions of the Empire
agreement are very generous on Canada's
part. For instance, British passenger automobiles are admitted to Canada free, whereas
cars coming in under the most favoured
nations tariff pay 171 per cent. Rubber
boots and shoes come in free from Britain,
but the most favoured nations duty is 22½
per cent. Typewriters, from Britain, free;
from most favoured nations, 22 per cent.
Industrial diesel engines, from Britain, free;
from most favoured nations, 20 per cent. All
through our tariff the preference prevails;
the tariff structure has been designed to
encourage British trade.
On the other side, wheat is a Canadian
export to the British Isles, and is admitted
free from every country. We have to enter
a free market in competition with the world.
But we do get a break on cheese, through
the fact that the United Kingdom imposes a
fifteen per cent ad valoremi duty on cheese
imported from the most favoured nations,
whereas cheese from Canada enters duty
free. Indian corn from the most favoured
nations enters Britain duty free. On Canadian motor cars Britain imposes a 22 2 per
cent duty, and on motor cars imported from
the most favoured nations the duty is 33-3
per cent. These are the larger items of our
exports and some of our imports, and I just
mention them to show you that our trade
agreement under the British preference is
one in which we do everything possible to
encourage trade with the Mother Country.
Then, of course, we are always faced with
the suggestion that we have a favourable
balance of trade in our dealings with Britain.
That has been true for many years; but,
mark you, there are very few countries with
which Britain has a balance of trade in her
favour. Britain's unfavourable trade balance
with Canada is getting smaller, though, and
if consideration be given to unrecorded items
of trade such as insurance, water transportation, tourists travel, and the expense of
maintaining Canada's air and other military
forces in Britain, it will be found that the

gap is really becoming narrower. I think
Britain will agree that her trade with
Canada is especially valuable.
Nations buy what they need, and need is
the test. In a free economy trade is made up
of individual efforts on the part of many
people; it is the accumulated effort of many.
Of course, there is an incentive for intelligent people to trade with one another. Thus
trade that is not controlled depends a great
deal on initiative and the salesmanship of
those who are interested in it. From what I
read in the report of the Commonwealth
Economic Committee on Commonwealth
Trade, Britain's trade with her colonial territories is not too good. It is reported that the
colonial territories have an unfavourable
balance of trade with Britain, although it
might be that in their trading with other
countries they do make that up, as I believe
most of the exchange must go to Britain.
I was referred to in the house the other
day as a "free trader from the Maritimes".
Well, I will admit I am in favour of the freest
kind of trade that is beneficial to our
country, and I am for Canada first. Trade is
always a two-way street. There must be
agreement both ways, and I hope in this
case we can prevail upon the Department of
Trade and Commerce to induce Britain to
open up the West Indies trade to Canada for
a capital consideration.
We are doing strange things these days
to promote trade and good will and to raise
the standard of living in other countries. We
have all heard of the Colombo plan, under
which certain nations are spending money
for the purpose of raising the standard of
living in South and South-East Asia. In this
connection, Canada is especially interested
in Ceylon. Reading from that part of the 1953
progress report by the consultative committee on the Colombo plan dealing with
external assistance, I find this:
The development of fisheries has been undertaken
with capital aid from Canada. Canada is also assisting rural electrification in the Gal Oya development area by providing Ceylon with the necessary
transmission lines, substations and other equipment.

Then the report goes on to say:
For 1953-54 Canada bas agreed to build and equip
a polytechnic school for training the lower and
middle grade technical skills, to finance rural road
conctruction, to provide 15 agricultural maintenance workshops, two diesel locomotives, 25 portable
pumping sets with sprinkler equipment and a wellboring machine to provide equipment for pest
control work and to assist further in the development of the fisheries project.

I have nothing to say against the Colombo

plan; indeed, it has its merits, particularly
by reason of the fact that the money we

FEBRUARY 3, 1954
contribute will be spent in Canada; that is
to say, equipment to be sent by Canada to
Ceylon and other countries will be made in
Canada and thereby provide work for Canadian labour. One can readily see the extent
to which the government is going in order
to create employment and promote a buoyant
economy. However, I would point out that
the West Indies are nearer home than the
Colombo plan countries. And in this respect
I am reminded of the old adage to the effect
that the nearer home you spend your money
the better is your chance of getting some of it
back.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
we on the North American continent also have
a duty to provide for our people a good
standard of living. At the same time, we
could quite easily make some capital investments in the West Indies which would raise
the standard of living and promote industrial
progress in that area. In such places as
the Windward and Leeward Islands one can
still see black men sculling transport with
long sweeping oars, just as their forefathers
did centuries ago. New equipment and
labour-saving devices would do much to
increase their efficiency and better their
chances of entering the markets of the world.
These opportunities are at our gates, and if
we really want to help the cause of humanity
we can do much on this side of the Atlantic.
Honourable senators have no doubt read
or heard about the Report of the Randall
Commission to the President of the United
States, recommending a 15 per cent tariff cut
to aid world trade. There will of course be
some opposition to that recommendation, but
it is at least indicative of the trend of affairs
and the thinking of people. The recommendaions of a commission appointed by the President of that great country surely will have
some effect as far as world trade is concerned.
I am quite sure the United States recognizes
that the fact that its money is worth so much
more than the currency of some other countries is a barrier to trade, and that something
must be done to bring about a balance. It
must be remembered too that the United
States is the biggest exporting country in the
world today; it has the largest merchant
marine and because of its technical advancement it is able to outrun any other country
in foreign trade. But its success as a trading
nation is surely not based on a question of
price. It is, however, notable that in spite
of its high standard of living, the United
States can produce cheaply enough to get into
the markets of the world.
The Randall Report further recommended
to President Eisenhower that there be an
easing of income taxation on the income of

Americans from investments abroad. This
recommendation has already been passed on
by the President to the Congress. If the people
of the United States are going to make foreign
investments they will place their money,
firstly, where they think it is safe, and secondly, where they think it will give a good
return. While our money is today at a
premium of 3 per cent in terms of the U.S.
dollar, the time may come when we are so
well supplied with money from outside the
country that our exchange rate will go higher,
and our problem then will be to find an outlet for our abundance.
Everyone now seems to be talking about
monetary conditions and trade matters, and
each is offering his remedy of the problems.
While this bill was under discussion I thought
it worth while to make some definite proposals to the Senate in an effort to provide an
outlet for capital investment and at the
same time improve relationships with the
British West Indies, a natural market for
the products of Canada.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I have been unavoidably absent from the
chamber recently and have not had an opportunity of reading the introductory speech to
this bill nor the debate in the other house. I
am prompted nevertheless to say a few words
as a result of some references to Newfoundland and the three maritime provinces just
now made by my honourable friend the senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley).
This bill deals with sterling settlement with
Great Britain. The trade problems of the
province of Newfoundland are particularly
interwoven with sterling-dollar difficulties. In
some respects the trade problems of Newfoundland are common to those of the other
eastern provinces, but in other respects they
are quite different. Some time ago, while
speaking on another subject, I referred to
the particular problems of trade which Newfoundland faced, and which might be eased
somewhat by negotiations that could take
place under such a measure as the one now
before us.
I may say, honourable senators, that I am
not at all critical of the bill; but while I am
not critical of the financial arrangements
which are being made, I do think that these
arrangements might have provided an opportunity for the resumption, by negotiation, of
certain conditions which prevailed before
union with Canada and were most helpful to
Newfoundland, but were discontinued shortly
after union was consummated.
On an earlier occasion I spoke in this
chamber of the peculiar circumstances which
surround Newfoundland's fishery exports

SENATE

during the latter days of responsible government and the beginning of the commission
government, up to the time of union. During
that period, which was one of great unsettlement of world trade, we had access to such
European markets as Portugal, Spain, Italy
and Greece, operating under the provisions
of the British Trade Agreements and the
currency clearing agreements with those
customer countries. The sterling which those
countries earned by trading with Great
Britain and the sterling area was made available for payment for Newfoundland exports.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
to be reminded that before the war-somewhere around 1935 to 1937-the foreign currency problems of some of the Mediterranean
countries became very acute. This necessitated some of them putting their foreign
trade more or less on a reciprocal trade
basis. The policy of Spain, and of Italy in
particular, I recall, was to restrict their imports from various countries to the amount
of their exports to those countries. The year
previous to the imposition of these restrictions Canada had exported to Italy about
50,000 hundredweights and Newfoundland
about 150,000 hundredweights of salted fish,
these figures being about the normal measure
of our respective exports. With the recession
of foreign trade caused by the new regulations Canadian exports to Italy of salted fish
immediately fell to 3,000 hundredweights the
next year, and other commodities were reduced, no doubt, in about the same proportion; while Newfoundland, still under the
wing of British trading agreements, maintained her salt fish exports at the previous
volume. Our producers were not then under
necessity of having our exports balanced
with imports; the British position was ours;
and our trade functioned normally.
I have always had the feeling that our
negotiators should have been more emphatic
in urging, under the terms of union with
Canada, a better provision for the protection
of Newfoundland's trade with those vital
areas, for Great Britain was particularly concerned in the iconsummation of union. I was
hoping and expecting, as many other Newfoundlanders were, that in the later negotiations with Britain concerning the settlement
of war debts, and the talks as to the general
sterling position which are constantly going
on, whereby each side gains something and
yields something, the position of Newfoundland, because of its past relationship, would
have special consideration. I think that, in
connection with a measure of the kind provided in the bill before us, this point should
be brought to the fore. I do not know
whether it is now too late to take some
action, but I do feel that Newfoundland has

suffered a "let-down" in this particular respect. True, the island had been helped in
its Mediterranean trade to some degree, but
with an uncertainty and irregularity which
is fatal to the orderly maintenance of trade
and stability which is so urgent.
I do not wish to create the impression that
our attitude is one of continual "grouse" and
complaint. We have been helped in connection with dollar receipts from Italy. We
have also had some assistance in facilitating
the clearance of dollars with Spain, but it
bas been very, very small, and in no way
comparable to what was available to us when
that trade was tied in with Great Britain to
the sterling area. The main trouble today
regarding Newfoundland's export of fish lies
in the falling-off of trade with countries
which, because of facilities previously provided by Great Britain, whereby we could
be paid in sterling, are now denied us. I do
feel that it would not be unreasonable to
require that the officials of the federal government, in negotiating such agreements as this,
should see to it that some special provision is
made for this trade. No other Canadian trade
has a parallel case in actual practice over
many years. I do hope that there will be still
an opportunity for this question to be brought
to the attention of the United Kingdom
authorities, and I believe, if it were properly
presented and urged and bargained for, they
would be co-operative.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend to delay the house, but it
seems clear to me that the two honourable
senators who have just spoken were out of
order. I think the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) knows
better: the honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) may have less experience in matters of this kind. But a debate
of this character should have been brought on
by a resolution placed on the order paper,
so that any honourable senator could be prepared to speak. I did not get up and object,
although both speakers were absolutely out
of order, because it might have been assumed
that, as I have been a member of this chamber for a long time, I was taking advantage of
my position; also, we have not so much to do
that it makes much difference. But I suggest that in future the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) should see to it
that honourable members who wish to debate
any special matter should-if necessary after
discussion with the Clerk of the Senate or
the Law Clerk-place the subject on the
Order Paper in the proper way.
As regards the bill before us, I was very
sorry that the honourable senator from

FEBRUARY 3. 1954
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) could not be
present when it was considered in the Banking and Commerce Committee, because on
the second reading he asked that departmental officials should appear and inform the
committee what debts are owing to Canada by
various nations, and what are the conditions
that relate thereto. This brings to my mind
the thought that, while it is all very well to
have, as the rules require, shorthand reports
of divorce proceedings, it would also have
been helpful to have had a record of the facts
presented to this committee taken down in
shorthand and printed and distributed to
every member of the house. The information
was well worth while.
The agreement before us is not a new one.
It relates only to the balance of a loan made
during the war period, when no interest on
such advances was to be charged. And may
I say to the leader of the house (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald)-I forget whether he attended
the committee meetingHon. Mr. Macdonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -that the official who
appeared before the committee impressed me
as very efficient. He gave us most useful
information.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I rise to a point of order.
I am pleased that the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) considered
my remarks important enough to warrant a
separate resolution, but from my parliamentary experience I assert that one is perfectly in order in speaking as I did on the
third reading of this bill. It is a money bill,
and in that respect resembles the budget.
One can deal with almost anything on a
money bill; and as a matter of fact, everything I said related to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next time I shall object,
and ask for a ruling.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I do not know whether I am in order,
but I would like to ask one question. I am
sorry I was not at the committee meeting;
and according to the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) the proceedings were not recorded in shorthand, so we
have no report of them. I notice that this
legislation has to do with a loan that was
originally made in 1942. I should like to
ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) a question, but as he was not
at the meeting of the committee perhaps the
Leader of the Opposition can furnish the
information. What is the present position of
the 1946 transaction whereby Canada loaned

Great Britain $14 billion and the United
States government loaned Great Britain $3î
billion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Great Britain is making her
payments according to contract.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When this bill was
read the second time in the Senate it was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce so that honourable senators might be informed as to the present
status of outstanding loans. I understand that
an official by the name of Mr. TaylorHon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -provided the committee with valuable information. I agree
with the honourable leader opposite that it
is unfortunate a verbatim report was not made
of the proceedings at that meeting. I suppose
any of our committees can have their deliberations reported and transcribed, but the
difficulty is to decide beforehand what information is likely to be valuable enough to be
reported. In this case I have no doubt that
Mr. Taylor could furnish honourable members with the information he gave to the
committee.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
my contribution to the discussion on the
third reading of this bill will be very brief.
Possibly I owe the house some kind of an
apology, because it was I who suggested that
this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce so that
honourable senators could be provided with
detailed information on these loans. Perhaps I may be reproached because I was not
present at that meeting, but I have' an
explanation to make. The meeting of the
committee was originally slated for Wednesday morning last, but was postponed until the
following morning. At 11 o'clock on Thursday morning I had an engagement with a
gentleman from overseas. There was no way
of getting in touch with him to change the
hour of our appointment, and it happened
that my interview with him took up the full
period the committee gave to the consideration of this bill.
Honourable senators, I agree with the observations of the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig). This legislation will not
grant additional money to the United Kingdom or to any other country. In moving the
second reading of this bill the honourable
leader on this side of the house (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) thoroughly explained the facts
relating to the loan Canada made to Great
Britain in 1942. Part of that loan was renewed at a later date. The loan was interest

SENATE
free and was made at a time when Britain
did not have dollars with which to buy the
war supplies she required in North America.
The loan was part of a scheme under which
Canada repatriated, bought back from
Britain, large amounts of dollar securities
which were owned by British nationals. The
British government told its people that they
must surrender these securities to the government, and take in exchange British government stock or bonds. Britain then repatriated
these securities to North America, selling
them for cash with which to buy guns, wheat
and anything else she required.
This agreement deals with the cleaning up
of the original direct loan of $700 million,
and I well recall the circumstances of that
loan. During last year another agreement
was negotiated between the United Kingdom
and the Canadian governments, at which
time approximately $1881 million was still
owing. It was agreed that during the course
of last year the United Kingdom would pay
$381 million, reducing the loan to $150 million.
This amount is to be paid quarterly over the
next five years and carries the interest-free
feature which was a characteristic of both
the original loan and the renewal of the loan
made some time subsequent to the termination of the war.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I think
it would be well if the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) could obtain
from Mr. Taylor the information he gave the
committee. I am persuaded that all honourable members will find, as I did, that the
loans Canada has made are in much better
shape than we thought they were. Every
member of this house ought to be supplied
with the valuable information that was presented to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall try to find
ways and means of supplying this information
to honourable senators.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

THE PRIME MINISTER'S TOUR
EXPRESSION OF GOOD WISHES

and we know their 'longcomings'. But our
intercourse with one another is that of friends
with friends. We are not part of the United
States; but, though not in their orbit, we live
near them; and we regard each other as
good neighbours and friends."
People in those remote parts of the world

are beginning to understand Canada; and I
think it is a very fine thing that our Prime
Minister will visit them. In all the nineteen
years that I have been a member of this
chamber there has been no more appropriate
time than the present for a representative
of our government to go to these ancient
eastern lands with the assurance that we of
the western world have it in our hearts to do
everything we can to raise their peoples to
higher economie levels, and that we have no
ulterior designs upon them. I do not know of
anyone who can perform this service better
than our present Prime Minister. Therefore
I want to join with the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in saying to the
Prime Minister: "Godspeed, and a safe
return."

CRIMINAL CODE
JOINT COMMITTEE ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS OF
CRIMINAL LAW-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, January 28, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons in the appointment of a joint committee
of both houses of parliament to inquire into and
report upon the questions whether the criminal
law of Canada relating to (a) capital punishment,
(b) corporal punishment or (c) lotteries, should be
amended in any respect and, if so, in what manner
and to what extent:

That the following senators be appointed on
behalf of the Senate on the said joint committee,
namely, the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard, Bouffard, Farris, Fergusson, Hayden, Roebuck and Veniot.
That the committee have power to appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be
deemed advisable or necessary.
That the committee have power to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as may be
ordered by the committee for the use of the committee and of parliament.
That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to report to the
Senate from time to time.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that house accordingly.

Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
on Thursday last I adjourned the debate, but
may I have permission to yield at this time
to the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and later to
adjourn the debate?
Some Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, in the first place permit me to thank
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) who bas just yielded his
place to me, for he did so purely to accommodate my convenience. I also wish to
thank the house for permitting it to be done.
Honourable senators will have observed
from the wording of the resolution that the
subject-matter for study by the proposed joint
committee of both houses is divided into three
parts: (a) capital punishment; (b) corporal
punishment; and (c) lotteries. I thank the
honourable Leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) for nominating me to the committee, because a great deal in the resolution
is worthy of consideration.

In

speaking to

this resolution, may I suggest that members
of the committee keep an open mind while
information is being placed before the committee by departmental officers and others.
I suggest that we do not commit ourselves
too much in advance. With that thought in
mind, I hope my fellow senators will not
expect me to reach any definite conclusions
at this time, because I feel that we should
first discuss the questions as they come before
us for consideration. There are, however, some
observations which I think may be made with
propriety at this time and which would not
prejudice my position now any more than it
is already prejudiced; and it might be well
also to say something by way of defining the
issues. I propose to deal with these three
problems separately and, where possible, to
seek such common ground as is available, if
any is available at all, upon which we could
all agree.
I say confidently that there is not a member
in this chamber today who would turn back

FEBRUARY 4. 1954
the hands of the clock in the matter of punishment for capital offences. There was a time
in English history when men, women and
children were hanged, drawn and quartered
for a long list of offences, most of which we
today would consider trivial. In 1780 the
penal law of England is said to have listed 240
capital offences, that is, offences for which
people might be, and actually were, hanged.
In the reign of Henry VIII there were 72,000
executions in England, some for treason, some
for murder, but for the most part for mere
offences against property which we would
classify, I think, as misdemeanours. Not only
were the number of offences and the multitude of offenders appalling in modern eyes,
but the cruelty and brutality with which the
law was administered in those days are painful to even read about, and the mere contemplation would be revolting to most of us.
Executions in those days were held in public
and were viewed as a spectacle by large
numbers of people, who seemed to derive
sadistic enjoyment from the tragic sufferings
of some poor wretches. The journey of the
condemned in open carts from Fleet street
prison to Gallows Hill was a London holiday
in which large numbers of people found great
fun and enjoyment. I think I can say with
great positiveness that there is no one in this
chamber or in this parliament, and there are
few indeed in Canada, who would want the
hands of the lock turned back in the direction of such conditions as I have mentioned,
and I think we all rejoice that such brutality
and barbarism has gone forever.
The reference in the Bill of Rights, in the
reign of William and Mary, to cruel and
unusual punishments which were forbidden,
was much more than a pleasant sounding
phrase. The reference was to such barbarities as boiling in oil, breaking on the wheel,
the thumb screw and the iron boot, drawing
and quartering and other refinements of
cruelty that would shock, I think, the savages
of a North American Indian village. Never in
America have we had suppression of property offences carried out with the same
brutality and excessiveness that were practised in Europe; although I have read of a
few individual cases of hanging in Canada
for sheep stealing; and I bear in mind that
in Massachusetts twenty poor, terrified women
were burned for witchcraft in one court in a
single year. So we on this continent are
not entirely without blame for inhumanities
of this kind, though they are insignificant
when compared with what happened in semimedieval England.
Nevertheless, there have been in this country notable changes in the passing years,

changes which I think most of us will regard
as real progress. But it seems to me,
honourable senators, that we can scarcely
assume that the progress which bas taken
place during these past years is now
complete.
The number of offences carrying capital
punishment have been reduced in Canada to
three, namely, treason, rape and murder.
I recall no execution having taken place in
Canada for the crime of treason since the
rebellion of 1837. Riel was hanged, not for
treason, but for the murder of Scott. And
I have no memory of a case of execution for
rape. Practically speaking, execution for
treason is almost obsolete, as is the offence
itself, and for rape, it is altogether abolished.
The fact that from a practical point of
view there is in this country only one crime
carrying the death penalty has come about as
a result of public opinion made manifest
through our courts, rather than through
I repeat that in practiceparliament.
although not in statutory law-capital
offences in Canada have been reduced to one,
that of murder. Gone are the days of the
thumbscrew, the stake, the rack, the wheel,
and the iron maiden; gone too are the noisome
prisons of Dickens' day, with their filth,
vermin and pestilence. Perhaps there is
something still to be desired in prison accommodation of today, but the faults in this
respect are trivial in comparison with those of
the past. Gone are the days of public executions with their sadistic spectacles. Executions today take place in private, and it is
evident that the public desire that officials
who conduct them should be as humane as
possible and that all reasonable steps be
taken to suppress publication of the gruesome details.
Not only have capital offences in Canada
been reduced to one, that of murder, but
the death penalty is now reserved for only
such types of murder as are premeditated,
diabolical and shocking.
I pause here to say that I heartily welcome
the appointment of a most humane gentleman,
the government leader in this house (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), as Solicitor General, whose
duty it is to administer the clemency of the
crown.
So, honourable senators, in both law and
in practice we have made great progress over
the past two centuries. The question raised
by the resolution before us is whether that
progress should now be regarded as complete, or whether we can with advantage
take a further step in the direction in which

SENATE
we have been travelling these many years
past-that is, the last remaining step with
regard to the death penalty.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: May I interrupt my
honourable friend to ask him if he has not
now come to the point where he is anticipating the report of the committee?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think I am
anticipating the report of the committee. I am
merely defining the issues which the cornmittee must consider.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I think the honourable
gentleman has gone beyond that.
Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: If I have, I am not
exceeding my rights. I do not know how
I could phrase the issues which the committee
will have to consider, without expressing my
views on them. The committee, if it is to
study capital punishment, must take into
consideration some of the thoughts which I
have expressed. But regardless of what the
committee recommends in that respect, it
should at least bring statutory law into line
with actual practice, which it is not at the
present time.
In our code there are no gradations of
murder as there are elsewhere. Here a conviction for murder is in all cases followed
by a sentence of death. Juries may return
a verdict of manslaughter in proper cases,
and judges and juries may recommend mercy
to the Governor General; but if the verdict
is murder no distinction is made in the
matter of sentence, which is death. But, as
a matter of fact, there are many gradations
of culpability in unjustified homicide. There
is the first great division of murder and
manslaughter. In manslaughter the courts
have the widest discretion in the matter of
penalty, but in murder they have none. In
all cases of murder the burden of distinguishing various grades of culpability is thrown
on the Remission Branch, headed by the
Solicitor General (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
There are, in fact, a number of classifications of the crime of murder. There is, first,
premeditated, unjustified killing, which elsewhere is murder in the first degree. Second,
there is homicide where there bas been
provocation, in the course of a fight, or in
heat of passion. Third, there is homicide in
the course of the commission of some other
serious crime, in which case all persons
participating in the serious crime are guilty,
although only one fired the fatal shot and
the others may have had no knowledge of
the intention to kill and no intention to kill.
In these circumstances there have been mass
executions on this continent which have
caused considerable public concern. In view

of the obviouslv many gradations of culpability a question arises as to whether our
courts should be given some responsibility
in recognizing the ýdifferences and some discretion in the matter of penalty.
There remains, as my honourable friend
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) has per-

ceived, this question of the necessity or
desirability of retaining in whole or in part
what is left of the death penalty in our
law.
My friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid), speaking recently in this debate,
suggested that if the members of the conmittee saw fit to visit a condemned criminal
in the death cell they should also visit the
home of the victim, so that their sympathies
might be properly divided. In other words,
while the senator did not advocate the visiting of the condemned man, he suggested that
the committee should not see one side of the
picture without seeing the other side. There
may be something in his suggestion, but let
me assure honourable senators that I will
do neither one nor the other. When considering a difficult and tragic subject such as
this it is not necessary that one approach the
question like a great block of ice; but neither
should one be carried away by sympathy.
Public questions should be approached from
the heart as well as from the head, but the
head should rule. I see no reason why members of the committee should not deal with
this question as human beings possessed of
normal, natural sympathy allied to good
common sense. It is not necessary that we
be ruled by preconceived notions and ancient
prejudices, nor, on the other hand, that we
yield to mere sentiment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder whether the
honourable senator would allow a question.
Does he think it possible that any member
of this committee can begin to consider the
three important matters before it without
preconceptions of his own?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Certainly not. Each
member of the committee will have behind
him a whole lifetime of knowledge, experience and thought, which, of course, cannot
be cast away. I said in my opening remarks
that the present discussion, which I feel is
appropriate, will not prejudice my position
any more than it is already prejudiced. Of
course no one could have had the long
experience in matters of this kind which I
have had, without coming to some conclusions with regard to these questions. I suppose that the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and I are
the only members of this chamber who have
had actual touch with executions, for each

FEBRUARY 4, 1954
of us, in the capacity of a provincial Attorney
General, had the responsibility of carrying
out the law of Canada in this respect.
I might say at this point that, partly
perhaps by chance, but mainly by design, I
have never defended a man charged with
murder. I have always been able to dodge
that responsibility, and I have done so
largely because I am hardly fitted, from
considerations of sympathy and the like, to
participate personally in such a proceeding.
I would not like to personally prosecute a
person charged with murder, and I prefer
to refrain from even defending one.
But, whatever may be the content of the
committee's report, in anything we may suggest we cannot be pioneers. Capital punishment has been abolished in quite a large
number of jurisdictions, including several
European countries, and for a considerable
number of years. In the parliamentary
library there is a book entitled Capital
Punishment, written by Julia E. Johnsen. It
was published in 1939, so that it is not quite
up to date; but it is a useful consolidation
of information on both sides of this question.
Quoting, on page 18, from an article by
Alfred E. Lawes, warden of Sing Sing Prison,
the author lists the following countries as
having abolished capital punishment: Belgium, in 1863; Denmark, 1933; Holland, 1870;
Lithuania, 1922; Norway, 1905; Portugal,
1867; Spain, 1932; Sweden, 1921; and
Switzerland (15 cantons) 1874. This penalty
has been abrogated, of course, only for
murder, not for political offences.
As regards the states of the union to our
south: Michigan abolished capital punishment in 1947; Rhode Island, in 1952; Wisconsin, in 1953; Kansas, in 1872; Maine, in
1887; Colorado, from 1872 to 1878 and again
from 1897 to 1901; Minnesota, in 1911; Washington, from 1913 to 1919; Tennessee, from
1915 to 1917; Oregon, from 1918 to 1920;
both North and South Dakota; Arizona, from
1916 to 1918; Missouri, from 1917 to 1919.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Have those states done
away completely with capital punishment?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: All of them abolished
capital punishment.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They do not use gas
chambers or other such devices?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no: there was complete abolition in the states I have listed.
Quite a number of others adopted the gas
chamber or the electric chair in place of our
method of execution. The list I have read
is not quite up to date, and so may not be
entirely accurate. I have no doubt we shall
83280-15

receive the latest information from officers
of the department; but what I have quoted
shows a record of experimentation from
which, one would think, the committee may
be able to draw a very considerable degree
of guidance.
Unfortunately, however, it seems impossible
to determine, merely from the rise and fail
of the murder rate, the effect of the abolition
of the death penalty and the substitution of
other penalties, or the reimposition of capital
punishment. Where the rate was high it has
remained high; where it was low it has remained low; in other words, it has been
fairly constant throughout. Obviously, many
factors are involved in the determination of
the murder rate. From the fact that you
cannot trace a consistent change one way or
the other in this experimentation, it might
be assumed that the death penalty, as opposed to some other form of punishment, such
as life imprisonment, is not a superior
deterrent.
In passing may I observe with some satisfaction that the murder rate in the United
States is somewhere about five times as great
as the murder rate in Canada. I feel that is
a matter of real satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is that comparison made on
a percentage or population basis?
Hon. Mr. Eoebuck: It is by unit of
population.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the comparison
refer to persons found guilty of murder?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. They are described
in the statistics as killings. They may involve murder or manslaughter or something
else, but they are looked upon as reprehensible, unjustified homicide. I suppose there
are as many explanations as there are people
in this room as to why the murder rate in
the United States is somewhere about five
times as great per unit of population as in
Canada. I should like to list what I think are
the major reasons for this difference.
First of all, I would mention the greater
general respect which I find in Canada for
law and morals; secondly, the greater veneration in this country for the sacredness of
human life and, thirdly, the greater likelihood
in Canada of apprehension and conviction. It
is an open question in my mind whether the
penalty itself has much to do with the difference in the murder rate.
Hon. Mr. Mclntyre: Are those statistics
compiled on a per capita basis?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
In my judgment, which I submit to this
house, the real control of the murder rate in

SENATE
any community is the moral sense of all the
people. By this I mean the universality and
the sincerity with which men and women
respect the lives of fellow humans, and the
intensity with which they condemn the intentional taking of human life. I take it that this
is why the murder rate rises after each great
bloody war. During wartime people lose
respect for the lives of their opponents and
actually devote their efforts to the full extent
of their ability to increasing the death rate in
the ranks of their enemies. There was an
orgy of killing following the American Civil
War, a vicious conflict in which there was
much hand-to-hand bloody fighting. In my
judgment the greatest potential weapon
against the murder rate is the cultivation of
a universal recognition of the sacredness of
human life.
Honourable senators, if I may be permitted
to reminisce I may say that the first murder
trial I recall was that of Burchall for the
slaying of Benwell, away back in the early
1890's. All those in the house who are old
enough will remember the mental picture of
that arch criminal Burchall as he sat in the
dock, nonchalantly sketching the judge and
the jury while famous counsel battled for
his life, and how the proceedings of the
trial crowded the columns of the newspapers
and filled the minds of Canadians at that
time. My submission is that it was the
morbid tragedy of the whole proceedings,
including the death penalty and the background, which produced the unhealthy mental
atmosphere in Canada during that period.
The first murder trial I ever attended, as
a reporter, was just after the turn of the
century, more than fifty years ago. It was
the trial of three brutal murderers, Rice,
Rutledge and Jones. Two of these men
cheated the gallows, but the third was tried,
condemned and executed, in a perfect welter
of newspaper publicity. All eyes were upon
the accused because of the general background and the black shadow of the gallows,
and there seemed to be woven around that
cruel brute a certain aura of tragedy which
filled people's minds in a way that was highly
objectionable. I was young at that time, but
I remember speculating even then about the
mystery of death, and wondering whether
the execution of the central figure had done
more damage in degradation to the community than it had done good. I am still
speculating in the same way. That aura of
tragedy is an element we cannot possibly disregard in matters of this kind.
Honourable senators, the question in my
mind as we approach the subject for study
is whether the death penalty is a sufficient

deterrent to murder-I mean above any other
type of punishment-to justify the renown
which it lends to criminals and to these capital trials, and the degrading effect of state
executions upon the communities where they
are carried out. That is the problem. The
committee must study the death penalty as to
whether it is a sufficient deterrent to warrant
its retention despite the other objectionable
features, or whether it would be possible and
advisable at this time to follow the trend of
the last few hundred years.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, as
one who has been named to serve on the
joint committee which is to study the questions under discussion, I do not think I should
remain in the chamber and listen to this
address. It seems to me that the remarks of
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) are entirely improper and
out of order and may have some influence
on me when I come to study this matter in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), who is
leaving the chamber, has just intimated to me
that he thinks I am going too far; and the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) talks about withdrawing. Of course,
I cannot stop him from withdrawing.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think your views
will influence me, but there is a possibility.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think I am entirely
in order; and although I certainly respect the
opinions of both honourable gentlemen I see
no reason for discontinuing my address unless
I receive a ruling to that effect from His
Honour the Speaker, which I think is most
unlikely.
Hon. Mr. Reid: As a member of the committee, you have gone pretty far.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is all right. I have
a right to go as far as I like. With all respect,
I see no reason for discontinuing my remarks,
and I shall continue. I intended to say, and
I think I should say, that there is something
very interesting indeed, and something
peculiar, about the attitude of human beings
towards their own deaths. We all fear death,
and we all know that it is approaching, yet
we fortify our minds against it by the very
simple expedient of not thinking about it.
I suppose everyone in this chamber has at
one time or another skated on thin ice just
for the fun of the adventure, although he
knew that black death flowed beneath the
crystal surface. There is not one member
here who would not travel by aeroplane,
although he knows that, in some percentage
of cases, however small, there is a possibility

FEBRUARY 4, 1954
of a crash and fatal disaster. We are all used
to living dangerously, and we close our minds
to the possibility of personal fatality. But if
there were the remotest possibility of life
imprisonment resulting from such a crash, no
member of this house could possibly be
induced to incur the risks of air travel.
With all deference to those who disagree
with me, I submit that these fundamentals of
the human mind should be borne in mind
when we are studying the question of the
death penalty.
As to corporal punishment, I have very
little to say, because I think I have spoken
long enough; but I suppose we can anticipate
a battle royal between, on the one hand, those
who would spare the rod and spoil the child
and, on the other hand, those who would
apply the rod and make us al smart, on the
basis that "It hurts me more than it hurts
you."

83280-15à

With regard to the third question, lotteries,
I admit that I approach it with some prejudice in favour of honest toil as against
gambling as a means of making a livelihood.
I offer no apology for being prejudiced in
that regard. But I shall certainly listen with
pleasure and interest to the suggestions which
I anticipate will be made for changes in the
lottery law, not forgetting, however, my
bias towards honest toil.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say now; but I do assure the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who did
me the honour of nominating me to this committee, that, with the other members of the
committee, I will devote to these important
public questions my very best thought,
industry and consideration.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 9, at 8 p.m.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLES-QUESTION OF
PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable sena-

tors, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I should like to discuss a question
of privilege. I received through the mail a
clipping from last Friday's edition of the
Ottawa Journal dealing with a debate in the
Senate on Thursday. The article is headed
"Senator Walks Out In Protest At Remarks
On Death Penalty", and after references to
the debate it says:
At this point Senator Arthur Marcotte (PCSaskatchewan) left the chamber, stopping at Senator Roebuck's desk. Senator Roebuck said Senator
Marcotte left because "he thinks I went too far".

That heading is certainly false, and so are
the words I have just quoted, as will be
seen from the Official Report of Debates of
the Senate. The fact is that I never did walk
out in protest. I did make an objection to
the remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), for I
thought he was going too far. But that was
all.
After that I stayed listening to
him for another twenty minutes, until the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) made his objection. At that time I
had to leave the chamber for it so happened
that I had an appointment to keep upstairs
and a train to catch. As I passed by the
senator from Toronto-Trinity I said to him

FEBRUARY 9, 1954
"Would you kindly excuse me for leaving the
house while you speak, as I have an appointment to keep and a train to catch?" Then
I left. Those are the facts. I did not walk
out in protest. As a matter of fact, I have
never walked out in protest against any
honourable senator's remarks. That is not
the proper way to object to anything. I have
other ways of registering an objection. Honourable senators, I certainly dislike this kind
of reporting.
I would refer honourable senators to the
following, on page 226 of the Senate Hansard
of February 4:
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) who is leaving the
chamber has just intimated te me that he thinks
I am going too far; and the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) talks about
withdrawing. Of course, I cannot stop him from
withdrawing.

Honourable senators, the point is that. my
objection had been made to the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity some considerable time before that, and I did not in fact
walk out of the chamber in protest. A mistake was made somewhere and I just wanted
to clarify the matter.

CRIMINAL CODE
JOINT COMMITTEE ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS OF
CRIMINAL LAW-ADDITION TO MEMBERSHIP

On the motion for resuming the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons In the appointment of a joint committee
of both bouses of parliament te inquire into and
report upon the questions whether the criminal law
of Canada relating te (a) capital punishment, (b)
corporal punishment or (c) lotterles, should be
amended in any respect and, if se, in what manner
and te what extent:
That the following senators be appointed on behalf
of the Senate on the said joint committee, namely,
the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard,
Bouffard, Farris, Fergusson, Hayden, Roebuck and
Veniot.

SENATE
That the committee have power to appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be
deemed advisable or necessary.
That the committee have power to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as may be
ordered by the committee for the use of the committee and of parliament.
That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to report to the Senate
from time to time.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that house accordingly.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Before the
debate is resumed, may I crave the indulgence of the house by referring to a suggestion
made by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). He pointed out
that only one of the members named to the
joint committee is not a lawyer, and thought
that some laymen should be included. When
the question of naming senators to the committee came up, there were certain senators
who I felt should be appointed. I think all
members of this house will agree that those
who have been named are especially well
qualified to serve on the committee. May I
just go over the names? The first is that of
Senator Aseltine, who has a wide law practice in western Canada and for ten years
has been chairman of the divorce committec
of this house. The next name is that of
Senator Beauregard. He is a lawyer in the
city of Montreal, has a very wide practice
there and is highly regarded in legal and
business circles of that city. Also, he was
for four years Speaker of the Senate. Senator Bouffard was at one time Batonnier of
the Quebec Bar, and he has a very large
practice in Quebec city. Senator Farris was

at one time Attorney General of the province
of British Columbia, and is a former pres-

ident of the Canadian Bar Association. Senator Fergusson practised law for some time
in New Brunswick, and subsequently was
engaged in social welfare work in that province. Senator Hayden comes from Ontario,
where he is an eminent cuounsel and has
acted as counsel in both criminal and civil
cases. He has a very extensive law practice.
Senator Roebuck was at one time Attorney
General of Ontario, and in that province he
has also acted as counsel on many criminal
and civil cases.
The last senator named to the committee
and the only one who is not a lawyer is
Senator Veniot.
He is a surgeon and
physician, and I think honourable members
feel that it is very appropriate that the name
of a surgeon and physician from this house
should appear on the committee.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) and the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)

suggested, and I think most other honourable
senators agree, that it would be desirable to
have some laymen on the committee. I have
spoken to the Minister of Justice with regard to this and he has no objection to the
addition of two senators to the -committee.
Therefore, if I have the unanimous consent
of this bouse I would move that the following names be added to the names of the
senators appearing in the motion for setting
up a joint committee of both houses of
parliament to study the criminal law:
Honourable Senator McDonald, who at one
time was a member of the legislature of
Nova Scotia and for a number of years was
Minister of Agriculture in that province, and
Honourable Senator Hodges, who before
coming to this house was Speaker of the
British Columbia legislature.
I realize I must have the unanimous consent of the house to make this motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, may
I say just a word? I understand the House
of Commons is appointing eight members to
this committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, seventeen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, that is different. Then
I have no objection to the motion at all.
The motion was agreed to.
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate then resumed from Thursday,
February 4, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald for the appointment of a joint committee.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
in speaking to this resolution to set up a
joint committee to inquire into questions
related to capital punishment, corporal
punishment and lotteries, I shall confine my
remarks largely to mental illness as it is
involved in the punishment of crime.
The records show, and those who are in
a position to judge have stated, that mistakes
occasionally occur, with the result that a
mentally ill person charged with a crime, has
paid the full penalty of the law, while the
person who was really responsible for the
crime was excused.
The Canadian Society of Psychiatrists, of
which Dr. Randall MacLean of Alberta is
chairman, have appointed a special committee to study this problem; and when their
work has been completed and they prepare
a report I hope that the royal commission,
which will be set up to study the problem,
will interest themselves in that report. I am
sure they will.

FEBRUARY 9, 1954
At this time I would submit to the members
of the proposed joint committee that they
should not decide hurriedly upon any piecemeal changes in the law until the whole
situation has been reviewed and there bas
been more research into the background of
crime and the trial procedure in cases where
the mental capacity of the accused is
involved. I shall try to give a few reasons
why I make that submission.
First, there is a wide difference between
the legal definition of insanity and the
modern medical conception of mental illness.
Clause 3 of section 16 of Bill 7, the Criminal
Code Bill now before parliament, contains a
statement to the effect that a person who has
specific delusions and who is guilty of a
crime, shall not be excused because of such
delusions; but that a person shall be excused
on the grounds of insanity if he has some
other form of delusions.
Now, a delusion is a false mental belief
which cannot be corrected by proof, or judgment or reason. I might give a rough example of that definition. Suppose a person
thought he heard a bell ring, but on second
thought realized he was mistaken, that would
have no significance. But if that person
believed he heard a bell ringing, and, in
spite of second thought or other assurances
that he was mistaken, could not be persuaded
that a bell was not ringing, and that condition persisted week after week, he would
have a delusion, and that would be one symptom of insanity. Some mentally sick people
do not have delusions, but when they have
delusions it is quite a significant symptom.
The section to which I referred seems to
imply that it is the degree of departure from
the normal, or the prominence of some symptom, which decides whether or not a person
is mentally responsible. But we all know
that malignant diseases of the body or of the
mind can exist without very prominent symptoms. Inconsistencies occur, because the section to which I referred is based on the
MeNaghten Rules, and the courts to some
extent are guided by those rules, which are
111 years old. In 1843 a man named Daniel
McNaghten was tried for the murder of
Edward Drummond. McNaghten suffered
from delusions of persecution. He wandered
aimlessly in Scotland, and later, in France;
and while in England he spent nights in the
fields. He became embittered and took into
his own hands the correcting of his imaginary wrongs by resolving to murder Sir
Robert Peel. He watched that minister's
home; he saw some man coming out, followed
him, and shot him. The victim happened to
be, not Sir Robert Peel, but Edward Drummond. McNaghten was tried by a jury, who
brought in a verdict of partial insanity, and

the prisoner was sent to what was then
known as a lunatic asylum-a term for which
we have now substituted "mental hospital".
The trial, and in particular the verdict,
caused a great sensation at the time, and
members of the House of Lords discussed it
for some days. Finally they set up a committee of fourteen judges to bring in answers
to certain questions, and these answers comprise what are known as the McNaghten
Rules. One of them is that a person with
only a partial delusion should pay the penalty
for his crime, because it was held that he
was responsible. These rules, of course, have
been used for a long time, but some of them,
including that relating to partial insanity,
are based on an assumed condition which is
not now recognized to exist. Although the
rules have been very useful, in the light
of present-day knowledge many members of
the legal profession-certainly, many psychiatrists-are not satisfied with them. The rules
are capable of different interpretations and,
as I have stated, they describe conditions
which do not exist. They can be changed, of
course, by parliament, and possibly by the
courts. In fact they have been modified in
seventeen of the forty-eight states of the
American Union through the addition of a
clause about "irresistible impulse".
This raises the question whether an impulse
is irresistible or whether it is simply not
resisted. The British Medical Association,
asked for a recommendation, reported as
follows:
It should be recognized that a person charged
criminally with an offence is irresponsible for his
act when the act is committed under an impulse
which the prisoner was by mental disease deprived
of any power to resist.

A group of over one hundred American
and Canadian specialists in mental diseases
was invited to answer this question: "Is there
a type of mental disease which makes it
impossible to control an impulse to do bodily
harm"? Ninety per cent of the replies were
in the affirmative. So we can conclude that
there is such a thing as irresistible impulse.
Hon. Mr. Vien: By whom were the answers
given?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: By one hundred United
States psychiatrists and all the Canadian
psychiatrists who could be contacted.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Were all of them medical
men?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes; all were specialists. According to present-day opinion, the
defect of the McNaghten Rules is that they
stress symptoms rather than the disease
itself. Section 16 'of the Criminal Code Bill
seems to be based on the assumption that if

SENATE
an accused person has a certain degree of
confusion and a certain set of delusions he
is responsible for his crime, but if he has
a greater degree of confusion and another
set of delusions he is not responsible. But
in dealing with symptoms in this case, as in
almost every other, persons may be misled.
The question which has to be decided is, was
the accused mentally ill or was he criminally
responsible at the time the act was committed? Did he know the difference between
right and wrong? Did he act under an
irresistible impulse? Those questions must
be decided as soon as possible.
Now, there is such a thing as the commission of crime in the early stages of mental
illness. In 1940 a man named Wilmans conducted an experiment in which he obtained
detailed life histories of seven prisoners. All
these persons were in jail, some of them
awaiting execution. All of them showed
signs of mental disease. They were taken
to a mental hospital, where careful examinations were made, as a result of which it was
determined that, certainly in four, and probably in the other three cases, the crimes had
been committed in very, very early stages of
mental illness.
One other reference to section 16. It provides that no person shall be convicted of an
offence in respect to an act or an omission
while he was insane.
Informed medical
opinion is not in accordance with that
principle. Many so-called insane persons do
know the difference between right and
wrong. The mental hospitals are filled to
overflowing with so-called insane persons
many of whom, in the opinion of the
medical superintendents, realize the difference between right and wrong.
I would like here to pay a tribute to the
medical supervisors of the various mental
hospitals. They are doing a great work collectively 'to try to find out all that can be
learned about this baffling subject, and they
are making a real contribution to human
welfare as well. As a result of these studies,
precise methods of diagnosis have been
worked out so that any advanced case of
mental illness can be diagnosed, and practically all the insidious cases can be detected.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable gentleman allow me a question? I do not want to
interrupt him.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw. It is quite all right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I wanted to ask him if the
medical opinion to which he has referred is
to the effect that there is no partial reduction uf the responsibility of the accused.

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: No, I would not say
that. The whole case cannot be decided upon
one symptom; it must be examined and
reviewed in its entirety. The specialists do
not believe in the existence of a partial delusion in a normal person; that is, they have
discarded the view that the brain acts in
compartments and have come to the view
that it acts as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In a certain case five eminent psychiatrists were called as expert witnesses. Two of them were of the opinion
that the accused was fully responsible. Two
stated that the will power of the accused had
been impaired to some extent, but not so as to
annihilate his responsibility. The fifth medical
expert said that, after hearing the evidence,
he found himself quite unable to express a
considered and definite opinion.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I shall attempt to deal
with that point a little later.
As the result of long study and observation more precise methods of diagnosing mental diseases have been developed, so that in
most cases now it is possible to say whether
grievous or insidious mental illness is present. The examination must not be donc in
haste, and a full case history is needed.
A careful and complete physical examination
is required. Has the accused had any serious accidents? Has he had any head injuries?
What diseases has he had?
Has he had
epilepsy, encephalitis, meningitis or sleeping
sickness, and so on? A full blood examination must be made and the condition of the
arteries examined to ascertain whether parts
of the brain are deficient in blood supply.
Heredity and environment are factors that
must be considered. What has been the
social background and home upbringing? Possibly an electric cephalogram and other technical examinations should be made.
The
point is that it must be a thorough examination and one that is made at the request of
either the prosecution or the defence, but
not for the prosecution or for the defence.
The duty of a medical witness is very different from that of a lawyer. The medical witness is bound to give his exact findings, for
that is his special duty.
Honourable senators, I have been endeavouring to show that the McNaghten Rules
must be revised and brought up to date. I
am trying to show that legal definitions
should be enlarged and that the medical
examinations should be as complete as
possible. I should like to refer to another
situation which makes mistakes possible. The
medical witness is always in an embarrassing
position when giving evidence. The doctor
stands in the witness box before the judge

FEBRUARY 9, 1954
who is presiding with all the dignity that
tradition calls for. Then there is the presence of the jury, and perhaps a crowded
court room. There are tables at which
lawyers sit, ready to do battle and take
objection to what is being said. Probably the
doctor is a poor witness anyway.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw:
A very eminent
psychiatrist has said that to his certain
knowledge a dangerous murderer was once
acquitted. This resulted from the skilled
advocacy of the trial lawyer. Every jury
regrets having to bring in a verdict that will
result in a death sentence. In this case the
lawyer exploited to the utmost the jury's
dislike and horror of the death penalty. He
interpreted the medical evidence to favour
his client, as of course was his duty. The
members of the jury were confused: they
could either send the man to the gallows or
acquit him, and they acquitted him. The
lawyer had sowed the seeds of doubt in the
minds of the jury, and their sentiments did
the rest. The accused man had murdered
his sixteen-year-old mistress. He was set
free but he soon returned before the courts,
charged with another crime which was se
horrible and revolting that he had to be
protected from his fellow prisoners. The
confusion of the jury was a factor in this
man's acquittal in the first instance.
I hasten to say at this point that I think
the jury system is a good system and has
made very few mistakes down through the
ages. However, the average juryman may
be confused over technical evidence. In a
recent Ontario case the jury found the
accused to be guilty, and he was sentenced to
be hanged. For some reason a new trial
was ordered, and with the very same evidence
the new jury found the prisoner to be insane
at the time the crime had been committed.
Honourable senators, I should like to make
a suggestion which I hope may prove valuable at this time. It may, of course, not be
accepted. I think the jury should have the
responsibility of deciding whether the accused
actually committed the crime, but when there
is a question of the mental capacity of the
accused I think the judge should decide as
to whether mental illness is present. If
this change in the law were made, the judge,
where mental responsibility is involved,
could request a board of competent men to
make a full examination. He could discuss
their report in the quiet calm and judicial
atmosphere of his own chambers. He could
question these people on their report and
decide what should be done.
83280-16

I think this system would have four advantages. First of all, it would prevent
mistakes that are now being made. Not
very long ago a mentally deficient boy was
sentenced to death for murdering a rather
prominent person. It was felt that public
indignation affected the jury. The boy was
hanged, although in the opinion of a
psychiatrist he was an imbecile.
Secondly, this system would be a step
closer to modern scientific criminology based
on justice and the protection of the public.
Thirdly-and I think perhaps this will
answer the question that the honourable
senator from Delorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
raised a few moments ago-it would prevent
the unfortunate confusion of contradictory
medical evidence, which of course is very
undesirable. If the judge were to hold consultations in his private chamber I think he
would be more likely to reach a correct
finding as to the accused's mental state.
The fourth advantage I see in this system
is that it would remove all possibility of
revenge entering into the picture. I am not
suggesting that jails should be turned into
mental hospitals; far from it. I have tried
to find out how many cases there have been
where the mental capacity of the accused
has been a problem. It seems that long ago
writers felt that 20 per cent of accused
persons suffered from some kind of a mental
disability, and recent writers claim that the
number is as high as 60 per cent, especially
in murder cases. I am simply pleading that
the medical specialists should be asked to
explore the facts, and that legal jurisprudence
should carry on from that point.
One more suggestion which I wish to make
is that in the interest of fair play it would
be wise to have the judge decide on the
punishment even in such crimes as murder.
I understand that in the case of first degree
murder the judge has no choice as to the
punishment, but I think for several reasons
he should have the right to decide in cases
where physical or mental illness of the
accused is involved.
I once talked to a member of a jury in a
murder case, after the trial was over. He
said: "Oh, yes, the evidence warranted a verdict of guilty, but we were sorry for the poor
little fellow. We didn't like the attitude of
the prosecuting attorney, and we knew that
if we brought in a verdict of guilty our little
friend would be hanged."
I know that the prerogative of mercy may
be exercised by the Governor in Council, but
I still think that the trial judges, who see the
witnesses, hear their evidence, and observe

SENATE
the prisoner day after day, are in the best
position to judge what should be done. I
have been dealing with those mental diseases
that encroach upon the minds of men and
take away their volition and normal functions. In section 16 of the bill there is another
condition mentioned, that of natural imbecility which, of course, is congential but still
requires some degree of judicial decision. The
problem is to decide between low grades of
mental intelligence and absolute deficiency;
and of course in these cases there should not
be vicious treatment of psychopathic persons, although the public must be protected.
After all, the punishment should only fit the
crime.
Honourable senators, our hearts go out in
sorrow and sympathy to the unfortunate dereliet who bas been conducted from the prison
cell along that dark corridor to the gallows.
We wonder and ask ourselves what defect or
flaw in our social system has contributed to
his downfall. Is it our way of life? Is it the
books we read? Is it that the day schools and
the Sunday schools have not reached that
person? Or is it that we have neglected some
phase of mental treatment? Then again, we
shudder to think of the cruelty of the dark
ages, and the callous way in which these
matters were then regarded. One hundred
and fifty-years ago there was a long list of
crimes punishable only by death. Most crimes
have been removed from that list, and murder
is about the only one remaining. The question before the committee will be: Has the
time come for wiping the slate clean? Well,
when I read, as I did recently, of a man and
a woman, apparently in normal health, who
carried out a deliberate plan to kidnap and
murder a child for the sake of receiving some
money, I can only say that the death penalty
should remain in the Criminal Code.
In closing, I express the view that we
should make full use of the very best knowledge that the age affords in deciding whether
evil intention or mental illness was the
impelling force that led to the crime. Modern,
humane, scientific criminology calls not only
for justice but for mercy-for treatment for
preventive measures, for efforts to reform
the accused as well as for protection of the
public.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator one question. Do I understand that
the part of the bill which he mentioned is to
be referred to the joint committee, or is it
not to be referred to a Royal Commission by
the Minister of Justice?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The Royal Commission
will be investigating the subject. I tried to
give some reasons why no drastic steps should

be taken until more research had been made
into trial procedure and into the background
of criminology.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
beg to move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the motion is put, I wish to say that
I have some doubt-and this is a good time
to raise it--whether my honourable friend,
who has been named to the committee, bas
the right to speak on this subject at the
present time. I question whether, under the
rules, any member of the committee has the
right to speak on the subject now. I question that very seriously. If Beauchesne is
referred to, I think it will be found that a
member appointed to a committee becomes
disqualified by speaking to the matter beforehand. It seems to me that this bears investigation, because the last man I would like
to see excluded from the committee is the
honourable senator from Vancouver-South,
(Hon. Mr. Farris). I would rather see him
on the committee than anybody else. I am
inclined to think that we are transgressing
the rule.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
on the point of order that bas been raised,
my understanding of the rule is that a
member of a committee, to disqualify himself from serving on it, must be completely
opposed to the committee and the purpose
for which it was set up. I do not think he
can be prevented from speaking on the setup of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In order to judge if I am
to be disqualified or not, perhaps it would
be as well to allow me to speak first.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I take
it that not only the members of the committee, but all members of this bouse will
be called upon to pass judgment when the
measure comes back from the committee. I

opinion against a committee and its purpose
is expressed by an honourable senator, he
would be disqualified from serving on the
committee; but otherwise he is perfectly at
liberty to express his opinion. We have
before us a motion to form a committee to
inquire into and report on certain questions
relating to the Criminal Code. I know of no
rule that would disqualify a member of the
committee from serving on it because of
expressing his opinion on the subject-matter
of the motion before it is referred to the
committee.

FEBRUARY 9, 1954
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may I say that since the last sitting I
have given some thought to this matter. As
far as I can ascertain, the fact of an honourable senator's name being included in the
motion should not deprive him of the
privileges uf debate enjoyed by other honourable senators, and I so rule. Most legislation bas to be debated before going to
committee. If I were to rule that a member
of the house who has been named to a committee was precluded from debating the
question to be referred to the committee,
then all honourable senators would be automatically debarred from discussing any bill
or other matter referred to committees of
which they are members.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, with
all due respect, I believe that the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) misunderstands my position. My opinion is that
any member can discuss the question as to
whether we should appoint a joint committee or not; there is no question about that;
but if after the niames are agreed upon a
senator who has been appointed to the committee expresses an opinion, expresses his
views, common sense would tell me that his
usefulness as a member of the committee is
gone, because he then has indicated he has
already made up his mind before he hears
any evidence at all. It would seem to me
that if we are going to derive any results
from the deliberations of the committee, a
member of that committee cannot rise and
say that he is against capital punishment,
for instance, before the committee hear the
evidence. Surely such an expression of opinion cannot be of any use to this bouse. My
view is that any of us who are not on the
committee may speak to the question, for
we have not got to hear the evidence. But
even in our case there is a doubt. If we
express our opinions now, shall we not be
already prejudiced in the decision that we
are called upon to make when the matter
comes back to this house from the committee? That is what I am afraid of. I will not
press the matter any further, but I wanted
to raise that objection. I still think honourable senators appointed to the joint committee should not speak at this time, and I am
doubtful if the house itself should discuss the
merits of the matters mentioned in the
motion. What we should discuss is only
whether or not a committee should be
appointed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
I think there is a point that has not been
emphasized in connection with this motion.
83280-161

When *a motion comes before this house to
appoint members to a joint committee for a
certain purpose, it is pretty hard, it seems
to me to place limits upon the discussion of
matters connected with that motion. I do
not think that an expression of his or her
views commits any member of the proposed
committee, or that it would prejudice a member in any way, shape or form, when the
'actual investigation before the committee
commences. Otherwise we would be precluded pretty much from discussing a good
many motions involving subsequent inquiries. Take, for example, the speech that we
have heard tonight. I do not think anything
that was said would prejudice anybody's
mind; rather, it was more in the way of
suggesting aspects of the inquiry that should
be considered carefully. I do submit that the
subject-matter of the inquiry cannot be separated at all from the discussion on the
setting-up of the committee, and to suggest
that some aspects of certain questions should
be included in the inquiry is a purely legitimate process.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Honourable senators, I
would suggest to His Honour the Speaker
and also to our leader that they read carefully Standing Order No. 65 of the House of
Commons. I think that Order makes it very
clear that anyone who is appointed a member of a committee to deal with a bill should
be very careful as to what he says regarding
the principle of the bill. You can have a
general discussion, there is nothing to prevent
you from doing that, but under Standing
Order 65 I do not believe that any member
who is going to act on a committee should
commit himself in regard to the principle
involved before the committee meets. I would
draw a parallel between this and the selection
of a jury. If it was known that a person w-ho
had been called for jury duty had already
committed himself and expressed his views
in respect to the case that the jury was going
to hear, then counsel on either side would
have the right to challenge him, on the
grounds that he was prejudiced. I think
if you read House of Commons Standing
Order 65 you will see that that is the principle which is involved here. You can have
a general discussion if you like, but that
is all.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Honourable senators, I
hesitate to say anything after all that has
been said, but I should like to make just
one or two remarks. I can hardly see that
expressions of opinion by a member of a
parliamentary committee are at all analagous
to expressions of opinion by a juryman concerning a case that the jury will be called

SENATE
upon to determine. After all, we are going
to consider evidence brought before the committee. Some honourable senators have taken
the stand that if a committee member
expresses a view either for or against, say,
capital punishment, that should automatically
disqualify him or her from sitting on the
committee, but it seems to me that that is a
rather unfortunate stand to take. I see
nothing at all to prevent any member of this
house from standing up and expressing views
in favour of or against, say, capital punishment. I have just been named to the committee, and I should not like to feel that I
am going into it with the knowledge that
my preconceived notions are not subject to
modification after I shall have heard the
evidence. It is rather suggested that members of the committee who take part in this
debate would be going to the committee with
closed minds, but I cannot agree. From my
little experience as a Speaker, honourable
senators, I am unable to see any objection
to any members of this house speaking to
the principle of the resolution, for I do not
believe that they would thereby commit
themselves in any way.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Honourable senators, I
do not want to argue that point at all but I
would suggest to the members of the Senate
that they read Standing Order No. 65 and
then put their interpretation on it.
An Hon. Senator: Read it.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I have not got Beauchesne's volume with me.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The Speaker has given his
ruling.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Will the leader read
Standing Order 65?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, I have not got it
here. The Speaker has given his ruling and I
do not think we should debate it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, there
is a fundamental point which is very clear,
namely, that those who participate in a debate
rnust speak to the question before the house.
The question before the house is that a joint
committee be appointed to study and report

upon certain matters. Therefore, we should
limit our discussion to the question: Is it
expedient or not to form a joint committee for
these purposes? In practice, however, when
a committee of this kind is proposed, the
subject-matter to be referred to the committee is also, by general consent, discussed to
a certain extent.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
may I have the privilege of asking a question
of the honourable senator who has just
spoken? One of the practices in this chamber
of parliament, at any rate, is that after we
adopt the principle of a bill we then send it to
a committee. Now, is there any rule which
says that a senator, knowing that a bill will
go to committee, of which perhaps he will
be a member, must not speak on the principle
of the bill before the bill goes to the committee?
Hon. Mr. Vien: My honourable friend is
referring to discussion on the second reading
of a bill, whereas this is a motion for the
appointment of a committee.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, on a
point of order, I would point out that His
Honour the Speaker has given his ruling, and
I submit that unless the ruling is to be
appealed there should be no further debate.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail this bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Taylor: Honourable senators, with

degree of urgency with respect to, this measure
owing to the fact that it must be passed in
the other place and receive the Royal Assent
before any negotiations can be carried out as
to the construction of rights of way.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill W-8, an Act respecting Brazilian Telephone Company.
He said:, Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to authorize Brazilian Telephone
Company to transfer its head office from the
city of Toronto, Ontario, to the city of Sao
Paulo, in the United States of Brazil. It is
proposed that upon the transfer becoming
effective, and if it is approved by the shareholders of the company, the Companies Act
shail cease to apply, and the company will
then become a corporation under Brazilian
law. The Brazilian Telephone Company is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited. Its
assets are wholly situated within Brazil, where
it carnies on its operations, and it is part of
the long-term plan of Brazilian Traction
Company to have its subsidiaries change their
status from foreign corporations to domestic
or Brazilian corporations. The chief purpose in maklng such a change is ta enable the
company to procure some of the financing for
its various enterprises within Brazil. Apparently the companies operating in Brazil have
not been able to raise money locally on
account of the operating companies being
foreign corporations.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
to know something of the functions of this
telephone company, and in dealing with this
I would ask for permission to keep fairly
close to my notes, because there are some
figures that I would not like to misquote.
The Brazilian Telephone Company was
incorporated under the Companies Act of
Canada i 1914. Its present authorized
capital is 1,050,000 shares of a par value of
$100 each, or an authorized capital of $105
million. There are at present outstanding
50,000 shares, all of which are held by the
Brazilian Traction, Lîght and Power Company Limited, which is a Canadian corporation; and I might say that there is no
intention of changing the status of the holding company. The Brazilian Traction, Light
and Power Company wiil remain a Canadian
corporation.
Although the name of Brazihian Telephone
Company has been changed on several
occasions, it has from the date of its organization been an operating company in Brazil,
with ail its assets there. The book value of
its assets at the present time is approximately $175 million. The company supplies
approximately 80 per cent of ail the toîl and
local telephone service now available in
Brazil, and the annual revenue fromn this

SENATE
telephone service is about $48 million, which
is, I believe, approximately 28 per cent of
the total gross revenue of all the subsidiaries
of Brazilian Traction. The investment that
Brazilian Traction has in Brazil is in excess
of $700 million.
The earned surplus of Brazilian Telephone
Company is approximately $30,000,000. In
addition to the 50,000 issued capital shares,
the company has outstanding a debenture
issue totalling approximately $65 million.
These debentures are owned by Brazilian
Traction, and certain of them are pledged
under a collateral trust indenture of Brazilian Traction, pursuant to which bonds of
the Brazilian Traction have been and will
be delivered to the World Bank-the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development-and to others.
As I propose to show later, I believe it
would be practically impossible to transfer
the assets of this company to a newly-formed
Brazilian corporation. That is why Brazilian
Telephone Company is asking for this rather
unusual power to enable it to change the
location of its head office.
The areas in Brazil at present served by

Telephone
Brazilian
approximately 38 per cent of the total population of Brazil and are the most highly
industrialized and progressive areas in that
country. The demand for increased telephone
service in the areas serviced by the Brazilian
Telephone Company has increased greatly.
Over the period from 1948 to 1952 the company extended its service by providing
approximately 160,000 additional telephones,
bringing the total number of telephones in
service up to 530,000. The capital cost of
those additional telephones in that period
was approximately $60 million. The demand
continues, and it is now estimated that
Brazilian Telephone Company must spend
about $180 million in the period from 1953
to 1957 to provide an additional 385,000
telephones and ancillary equipment.
In order to meet the tremendous demands
for its services Brazilian Traction has borrowed in the past few years approximately
$110 million, has negotiated an additional
loan of $18 million, and has arranged extensive credit from suppliers in Canada, United
States and elsewhere throughout the world.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that Canadian money?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is not entirely
Canadian money; some was raised in England, some in the United States and some in
Canada.
It is apparent that the company must
raise much additional capital; and after careful investigations the company has come to
the conclusion that the most practical and

probably the only feasible method of financing
is by raising capital in Brazil by way of
equity financing.
Under Brazilian corporation law the President of Brazil bas power to issue a decree
giving the company a Brazilian nationality,
provided that the head office of the company
is moved from Toronto to a city in Brazil;
and the present bill provides that upon the
issuance of the decree the Companies Act of
Canada shall no longer apply to Brazilian
Telephone Company.
For the purpose of the record perhaps I
should quote some provisions from article 71
of the Brazilian law governing nationalization
of foreign companies. First I should say that
"nationalization" in this respect is used in
a different sense from that which we understand. It is proposed to make the corporation
a domestic corporation subject to the laws
of Brazil.
Article 71:
A foreign corporation authorized to carry on
business in Brazil may be nationalized, subject to
authorization of the federal government, by transferring its head office to Brazil.

That is the first requisite.
Para. 1-For such purpose it shall, through its
qualified representatives, file, together with the
application, the documents required by article 64,
sole paragraph, items a, b and c, excluding the
exception permitted in this last item and f; proof
of the capital having been realized in accordance
with the charter or by-laws and the minutes of the
general meeting of the shareholders at which the
nationalization was decided upon.
Para. 2-The federal government may impose
such conditions as it deems convenient to protect
the national interests.
Para. 3-Once the conditions imposed are accepted
by the qualifled representatives, the federal government shall issue the decree of nationalization, there
being complied with, thereupon, the provisions, of
paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 61.

Again, for the purposes of the record, so
that anyone reading these remarks may
understand the requirements of the Brazilian
law, I will read items a, b, c and f referred
to in paragraph 1 of article 71:
(a) proof that the company is constituted in
accordance with the law of its country;
(b) a complete text of its charter and by-laws;
(c) a list of its shareholders setting forth the
names, professions, addresses and number of shares
held by each of them, except where being the
shares to bearer, it will be impossible to fulfill such
requirements;
(f) the last balance sheet.

I will now read paragraphs 3 and 4 of
article 61 which are referred to in paragraph
3 of article 71:
Para. 3--Upon grant of authorization the respective decree and the documents hereinbefore referred
to in this article shall, by means of certificates
issued by the competent department of the government, and within 30 days, after the payment of
all fees and taxes due, be published in the official
gazette of the Union, and a copy of such

FEBRUARY 10, 1954
gazette shall be filed in the commercial Registry
Office of the place where the corporation has its
head office.
Para. 4-The certificate of filing issued by the
Commercial Registry Office shall be published in the
Official Gazette of the Union.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Could the honourable
gentleman inform the house when the act
from which he is reading came into effect,
and whether it is still in effect?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The act has been in
force for some time, and this particular
article came into effect on September 26,
1940. Quite a number of foreign corporations have already changed their status to
that of Brazilian corporations, and have complied with the provisions of this act.
This bill is a prerequisite to the company's
making application in Brazil, pursuant to
Brazilian corporation law, for a decree by
which the company will become a Brazilian
corporation. If the bill becomes law it will
then be necessary for the company, in order
to transfer its head office from Canada to
Brazil, to have this sanctioned by the uanimous vote of its shareholders at a special
general meeting ealled for the purpose.
As I stated earlier, the company cannot
raise capital in Brazil unless the operating
companies are changed into Brazilian companies subject to Brazilian corporation law.
In order that these operating companies may
continue to meet their obligations under the
concessions under which they operate in
Brazil, it is necessary for them to obtain substantial financing from Brazilian residents.
Honourable senators may wonder why it
was not possible to incorporate a company in
Brazil and then transfer the assets of the
Canadian corporation to the Brazilian corporation. That procedure has been carefully considered and has been followed wherever
possible. In this particular case, however,
many difficulties would have been encountered in the transferring of assets. I will mention these difficulties, briefly.
Telephone service is provided under many
concessions which establish the rates of return
permitted to the company. Toll service is
provided under state toll concessions. Local
telephone service is provided in certain areas
under state concession, but in many areas it is
under municipal concessions; for example, in
the state of Sao Paulo there are approximately ninety-five separate and distinct municipal concessions under which service is
provided. In order to effect transfer of assets
m any given municipality under municipal
concession, it would be necessary to have the
consent of the municipality to the transfer.
Negotiations for transfer of these concessions, along with simultaneous negotiations

for satisfactory rate bases and rates to ensure
adequate return, would present at this time
an impossible task for the company. It is
anticipated that negotiations for satisfactory
rate bases and rates, where and when necessary, can more readily and successfully be
carried through after there is public participation in the company.
In order to transfer assets to a new company, it would be necessary to prepare a
detailed inventory of all the property of the
company so that the assets could be valued
by experts, as required by Brazilian corporation law. This in itself is a itremendous task
which would in fact delay the reorganization
and the appeal to the public market for
many months.
Then there is a third item, transfer taxes,
which would be very substantial in this
particular case. A transfer tax payable on
the transfer to a new telephone company of
the extensive assets of Brazilian Telephone
Company would be substantial, being at the
rate of 6 per cent in the state of Sao Paulo
and 9 per cent in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
on the value of the immovable assets of the
company. The transfer of the concessions of
the company would also be subject, in the
state of Sao Paulo, to a tax based on the real
value of the concessions. To establish the
value of the concessions for the purpose of
this tax would, it is considered, require
lengthy negotiation.
I have touched on the difficulties with
respect to financing. The collateral trust
bonds of Brazilian Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited, held by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
the Canadian public and others, are secured
in part by dollar debentures of Brazilian
Telephone Company. These debentures are
secured by the equivalent of a floating charge
on the assets of the company in Brazil. In
the light of Brazil's present exchange crisis,
the issue of dollar debentures of a Brazilian
company which would be necessary on the
transfer of assets to a new company would
present many difficulties, whereas the proposed method leaves the existing debenture
debts unaffected. In addition, it would be
an impossible task to transfer immediately
to the new company legal title to the assets,
which would be essential for the security of
the collateral trust bonds of Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited.
The company, in the light of all these
circumstances, considers it is possible to
vary the procedure of transferring assets in
the ordinary way of incorporation. It can
be readily understood that an attempt to
carry through the reorganization of Brazilian
Telephone Company by way of transfer of

SENATE
assets would involve protracted delay, at
great cost, even if it were possible. The
procedure suggested by this particular bill
would exceedingly simplify the transaction.
If the bill passes, it would only be necessary
to hold a meeting of the shareholders of the
company and have them sanction the proposal, and then have the company apply
under Brazilian corporation law for the
necessary decree. From that time on the
company would cease to be a Canadian corporation, affected by Canadian law, and
would become a Brazilian corporation, entirely controlled under Brazilian corporation
law.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why was it incorporated
in Canada in the first place?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: In the first place, I
think the policy was to require all companies
operating in Brazil to be incorporated in the
foreign jurisdiction from which the capital
was being raised. For instance, a number
of Brazilian companies are incorporated in
England and Belgium, and some are incorporated in Canada under the Federal
Companies Act and one under the Ontario
Companies Act. In this case the Canadian
corporation, the holding corporation, was
incorporated in Canada, because it was
thought that the original organization of these
operating companies should be done under
the corporation laws of the countries where
they were securing a substantial amount of
their financing. lowever, demands for new
services in Brazil have become so great that
it is quite impossible to keep pace with them.
Brazilian Traction Company has had to secure
money wherever possible in order to try to
carry out its expanding services, and it is
now apparent that it will have to have assistance from investors in Brazil and possibly
from Brazilian banks.
There is in Brazil what is known as the
Brazilian National Economic Development
Bank, which is modelled on the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It
is not the Brazilian bank's policy to advance
money to foreign corporations or to any
corporation unless a substantial private investment is made by Brazilian residents. To
this date Brazilian Traction has never been
able to persuade private investors in Brazil
to make investments in either the operating
companies or the holding company, but it is
hoped that the steps which are being taken
to transfer the head office of the operating
companies to Brazil will encourage substantial private investments in Brazil and
through this Brazilian National Economic
Development Bank.

Probably a bill of this kind should go to
the Banking and Commerce Committee, and,
if honourable senators agree, I will move
later that the bill be referred to that committee. Mr. Henry Borden, the president
of the company, will be here next week.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask if Canadian
shareholders would not be losing control of
some of their valuable equity?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Of course, the equity
of Canadian shareholders is in Brazilian
Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited.
There is no suggestion that that corporation
is going to change to a Brazilian company.
Brazilian Traction holds and will continue
to hold the shares of this operating company,
and I suppose instead of being a whollyowned subsidiary it will become a controlled
subsidiary. Certainly, it will not lose any
of its assets. What will happen in Brazil in
the future is another question.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Did I understand the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) to say between the years 1948 to
1952, during which period 160,000 telephones
were installed, all the expansion costs,
amounting to $60 million, were raised by
borrowing?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I think that amount
was raised by borrowing. I am referring to
Brazilian Traction, of course, for the principal borrowings are made by the parent
company. The security that is pledged is
very often the security of the operating
company.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
must be frank in saying, first of all, that I
do not know as much about the set-up of
companies or the operation of companies as
do honourable members who are lawyers
and who have brought a lot of charters
before this chamber, but I think this is an
extraordinary bill. Here is a company that
was granted a charter by the Canadian government on behalf of the Canadian people,
and shares were sold to the Canadian people
and their money invested in Brazil. From
what I have read, this proposed change has
come about because of certain threats that
have been made by authorities in Brazil
against companies operating there. I say to
honourable senators that if a measure came
before parliament asking for the grant of a
charter to a company whose head office was
in Brazil, I doubt if we would pass it. The
head office of Brazilian Telephone Company
has been in Canada, and a charter was
granted to it and Canadian money has been
invested in it. Now it is proposed to transfer

mons. There is also provision to increase the There was a week's difference in the dates

SENATE
on which we reassembled after Christmasthe other house reassembled on the 12th, and
the Senate on the 19th-and each house has
been in session continually since then. Generally speaking, the two houses of parliament
are in session an equal number of days every
year.
When parliament assembles it is necessary
for members to come here. Now, it is true
that some members who live within reasonable distance of Ottawa can return home from
week to week, but others are unable to do
this and are forced to spend their full time
here while parliament is in session. Honourable senators realize that an honourable
member from Newfoundland, from Nova
Scotia, from Prince Edward Island, from New
Brunswick, from the eastern portion of Quebec, from the western portion of Ontario,
from northern Ontario, from Manitoba, from
Saskatchewan, from Alberta, from British
Columbia or the Yukon cannot return to his
home at week-ends, and in many instances it
is doubtful if he can get home while parliament is in session. It is therefore idle for
anyone to suggest, and I am sure no one in
this chamber will suggest, that a member of
parliament can carry on his ordinary business
and, at the same time, be a member of parliament. It just cannot be done.
And more than that: a member of parliament may stay in Ottawa, away from his
family, throughout the length of a session.
Personally I do not think that is desirable,
and most members of parliament do not think
it is desirable. Many of them, therefore, bring
their families to Ottawa and keep them here
so long as the session lasts. And whether or
not a member does this, he does in any event
have to maintain two residences during sessions of parliament. One residence may be
in a hotel or a private house in Ottawa-at
any rate it has to be somewhere in or near
Ottawa-and the other is in his home community.
I mention these things by way of pointing
out that the length of the session has increased
to such an extent since 1920 that members
of parliament today not only have to devote
more time to public business than was necessary then, but also have been obliged to adopt
a way of living that is considerably different
from that followed by members of parliament
thirty-three years ago.
For those reasons, honourable senators will
see that it is necessary to make some change
in the indemnity. It was felt that an increase
at the same rate as the previous increases,
namely, two-thirds of the existing amount,
would be satisfactory, in that it would enable
members of parliament to carry on their
public duties without too great a sacrifice.

Far be it from me to dwell on the sacrifices
that members of parliament have to make;
nevertheless, we know that they have to live,
and they require sufficient moneys on which
to live.
The bill further provides that the indemnity, which is on a yearly basis, shall be payable at a monthly rate. From time to time
over the years two sessions of parliament
have been held in one year, with the result
that exclusive of the expense allowance, each
member of parliament received two indemnities of $4,000 each, or a total of $8,000. That
is the amount which this bill would provide
as an annual indemnity, and whether there
are one, two 'or three sessions in a year,
members of parliament cannot draw more
than one sessional indemnity of $8,000. In
that way, after passage of this legislation a
member will receive the same annual
remuneration as he received previously in a
year in which parliament held two sessions.
The bill makes provision as to the date at
which indemnities shall commence. For an
honourable senator the annual indemnity
shall date from the day on which he is summoned 'to the Senate; for a member of the
other place it shall commence on the date on
which he is elected to parliament and shall
cease on the day on which the following
election is held. And as I have already
pointed out, that indemnity will be paid
monthly.
The bill provides a change in the number
of days a member of parliament may be
absent without cause before a deduction is
made. Honourable senators will recall that
under the present act a member is allowed
to be absent from the chamber without cause
for fifteen days on which the house is sitting.
A member who is absent for more than
fifteen days is now charged $25 a day against
his indemnity, plus $12.50 against his expense
allowance. In 'other words, for every day
a member is absent beyond fifteen days he
must forfeit $37.50. Under the proposed bill
a member may be absent twenty-one days.
The reason for the extension is the longer
sessions of parliament. In the days when
the session lasted only sixty-five days it was
felt that fifteen days' absence without cause
was sufficient; but now that the sessions have
lengthened considerably, it is felt that there
should be an extension from fifteen to
twenty-one days, and the bill was so
amended in the other house.
The bill also provides a greater penalty
for every additional day's absence than that
previously imposed. As presented to the
other house, the bill provided for a penalty
of $25 a day. But as the bill now 'stands,
a member of parliament will be penalized

FEBRUARY 10, 1954
$40 a day against his indemnity, for every
day he is absent beyond twenty-one days,
plus $20 a day against his expense allowance.
In the result, a member will be penalized
$60 for every day's absence without cause
beyond twenty-one days.
Honourable senators, I believe I have
explained all the pertinent provisions of the
bill. It has passed through its various stages
in the other house and now comes to us for
our consideration.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, may
I ask the leader a question? He has stated
that the payments of the indemnity will be
on a monthly basis, which I think is quite
proper, but he has said nothing as to the
expense allowance, which is now paid at the
end of the year. Is there any reason why
that allowance also should not be paid on
a monthly basis? Or has anything been done
about it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As honourable senators know, the expense allowance is provided
for in another section of the Act, and is not
before this bouse at the present time. That
section provides that the allowance shall be
subject to half the deductions, if any, from
the sessional indemnity. Therefore, without
any action on the part of this house, it automatically becomes $20. Any action to be
taken in connection with putting the expense
allowance on a monthly basis, would be by
way of an amendment to that section.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
leader a question? Does he think that subsection 1 of the new section 33, in section
2 (1) of the bill, is clear? Do the words,
For the sessions of each parliament there shall be
paid to every member of the Senate and House of
Commons ...

make it clear that a member cannot draw
two sessional indemnities in one year? For
instance, we are in one session now, but we
might be called back to another session this
fall. Does the bill make it clear that only one
indemnity a year will be payable?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the bill makes
it quite clear that a member may draw only
one sessional indemnity in any twelve-month
period. Previously, as I have said, two
sessions frequently took place in one year,
and members claimed two indemnities of
$4,000 each. The present bill would prevent
claims for two indemnities in one year.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, in support of this resolution it is
most opportune and fitting, I think, to place
on the record a short extract from the speech
delivered in the other place by the Prime
Minister when moving the second reading

of this bill. In my opinion the statement
he made there is the most adequate expression which has been made in parliament
of the relations of the various branches of
parliament to each other, and will constitute
a complete justification of this chamber in
giving approval to the bill. I mention this
statement particularly because comments on
the bill, in the other place and more largely
outside, have been directed to the position
which this house occupies in relation to the
proposals now before us. Without any further
remarks, and being anxious to avoid an
appearance of or approach to recrimination,
I would like to quote from pages 1637 and
1638 of the House of Commons Hansard of
February 1:
Why should members of the other branch of
parliament receive the same indemnity as the members of this bouse? Since confederation, that bas
always been the case. Perhaps that, in itself, is
not a sufficient reason. But what does appear to
me to be a sufficient reason is that the four provinces stated, as expressly set out in the British
North America Act, that it was their desire to be
federally united into one dominion under the crown
of the.United Kingdom, Great Britain and Ireland,
with a constitution similar in principle to that of
the United Kingdom. The parliament of the United
Kingdom bas been a two-chamber parliament as
long as it bas been a parliament, I believe-and
that is for many centuries. The act itself, carrying
out that principle, and that construction of the
principle, provided that there shall be one parliament for Canada consisting of the queen, an upper
house styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.
Now, that was the constitution that the fathers
of confederation represented as being the one
desired by the Canadian public. That constitution
bas operated now in this country for 87 years; and
I, for one, feel grateful that the fathers of confederation did recommend at that time that the
constitution for the parliament of this new federal
dominion under the crown should be similar in
principle to that of the parliament at Westminster.
I think the parliament at Westminster bas been the
model of all successful democratic parliaments that
have been established in the world since that time.
I know that questions have arisen from time to
time about the portion of the work of parliament
that is effectively done by the members of the
Senate. Well, it must be recognized that the situations in the two bouses are somewhat different and
in consequence, though they both have responsibilities to the Canadian people, they have responsibilities of a different aspect concerning each of
them ...

Everything of a legislative character bas to be
considered and bas to be passed by both houses of
parliament. And I have never heard any serious
complaint from any source that the members of the
other bouse of parliament do not give consideration
and study to legislation-which could not become
legislation unless it had their concurrence.

I submit, honourable senators, that nothing
can be usefully added to or subtracted from
that statement.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would draw to
the attention of honourable senators the fact
that under existing practice it is definitely
provided that no reference shall be made in

SENATE
our house to the debates in the other place
within the same session. Bourinot, 4th edition,
page 357, states:
It is also a part of the unwritten law of parliament that no allusion should be made in one house
to debates in the other chamber, a rule always
enforced by the Speaker with the utmost strictness.

Under these circumstances, honourable senators, apt as is the quotation of my honourable
friend, I have, I believe no alternative but
to draw this rule to the attention of the
house, and to leave the Senate itself to decide
in its wisdom whether, with unanimous consent, it will establish a precedent and take
the responsibility of overruling this very
definite and well-established custom.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
thank his honour the Speaker for expressing
his opinion. Before I read this statement I
made some inquiries about the precedent
involved, and I assumed that, before proceeding with the quotation, I had the unanimous
consent of the Senate. I should be very glad
if it could be assumed that such unanimous
consent did in fact exist.
The Hon. the Speaker: Perhaps I was in
error in net having drawn earlier the attention of the house to the fact that the honourable gentleman could not, under existing
rules, proceed with the reading of the quotation without the unanimous consent of the
Senate. In this, as in all other matters of
procedure, the Senate itself is, I assume,
supreme; and it is for the house to decide
whether it will give unanimous approval to
something which would otherwise be open
to objection.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, on
the point of order, I must say that I object,
so there cannot be unanimous consent. I
speak on my own behalf and on behalf of
my party. I am very solicitous that this
house shall not get into debates and fights
with the other house on the basis of statements made over there. Through all the years
since 1867 the practice of this house has been
-as you, sir, have pointed out-that we do
net discuss their statements, and they should
not discuss ours. As Leader of the Opposition I feel a responsibility greater than I
would as an ordinary member to maintain
the best traditions of parliament.
Long
experience has shown the wisdom of the
principle that neither house shall discuss
utterances in the other house during the then
current session. I was going to protest during the speech of the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), but I have so
much regard for my honourable friend that
I did not wish, by interrupting him, to give
the impression of being a confirmed objector
in these matters: I therefore waited until he

finished: and I expected that you, Mr.
Speaker, would draw attention, as you have
done, to this breach of the rule. But I must
record my objection to the reading of the
statement.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting.
CRIMINAL CODE
JOINT COMMITTEE ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS OF
CRIMINAL LAW-MESSAGE TO COMMONS

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Macdonald:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons in the appointment of a joint committee
of both houses of parliament to inquire into and
report upon the questions whether the criminal law
of Canada relating to (a) capital punishment, (b)
corporal punishment or (c) loiteries, should be
amended in any respect and, if so, in what manner
and to what extent:
That the following senators be appointed on
behalf of the Senate on the said joint committee,
namely, the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard, Bouffard, Farris, Fergusson, Hayden, Hodges,
McDonald, Roebuck and Veniot.
That the committee have power to appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be
deemed advisable or necessary.
That the committee have power to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as may be
ordered by the committee for the use of the committee and of parliament.
That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to report to the Senate
from time to time.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inforrn that house accordingly.

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I shall be, for me, comparatively brief.
I approach this question with some diffidence,
as I see the tendency has been developed in
my honourable friend, the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) to raise technical
objections. Because he looks a little worriedHon. Mr. Haig: Not a bit.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -may I assure him that
I have given full regard to his concern in
this matter, and that I shall endeavour not
to transgress his ideas of the fitness of expressing an opinion in a discussion of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I anticipated that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Bearing in mind the discussion that took place during this debate
in the Senate yesterday afternoon, I thought
it would be advisable if I were to make it

FEBRUARY

clear at the outset of my remarks that I
intend to deal with the subject-matter of this
motion under three headings. First, the consideration of the principle of the motion
itself; secondly, the consideration of the
selection of senators to serve on the committee; thirdly, consideration of the subjectmatters to be included for study by the committee. I feel that under this last heading
we are entitled to consider one or more
subjects which might well have been added
to the three set out in the motion before
the house.
Honourable senators, I propose to consider
briefly each of the three headings I have
listed. The first is as to the principle of
the motion. I note that there has been
some informal discussion outside of this
chamber about the application of Standing
Order 65 of the House of Commons rules,
which I understand have been usually
adopted and followed in this house. That
rule provides that if any member challenges
the principle of a bill or motion he disqualifies himself from serving as a member
of a committee dealing with that bill or
motion. I think there is logic in that rule.
The principle of the resolution now before
us is a simple one. It is simply that the
Senate do unite with the House of Commons
in the appointment of a joint committee of
both houses of parliament to inquire into
and report upon certain questions. Shall we
have such a committee? That is all there
is to it. I certainly think that Standing
Order 65 should be applied in the case of
any honourable senator who feels that such
a joint committee should not be set up.
I once had experience in a murder case in
which one of the jurymen did not believe
in capital punishment. It was a very clear
case, but the jury disagreed, one man against
eleven. We later learned that the reason
for the disagreement was that one man did
not believe in capital punishment. He should
never have been on that jury.
The question of preconceived ideas about
the questions that are to be considered by
the joint committee, after it is formed and
begins its functions, is rather a different
matter. I do not suppose that one could
find an intelligent group of men, either in
this house or elsewhere, capable of sitting
on a committee of this nature who have not
some degree of preconceived
opinions,
particularly about capital punishment. If
these preconceived opinions are so determined
in a person's mind that he recognizes he is
incapable of giving any fair consideration
to the problem in question, then he ought
to refuse to sit on such a committee. However, short of that, it is my oxtiion that it

10, 1954

is to be expected and desired that the men
and women who are to serve on this joint
committee are at least intelligent enough
and informed enough, either through reading
or experience, to have ideas about these
questions and yet still be capable of giving
fair -consideration and respect to the opinions
of others as the work of the committee
progresses.
It has been suggested in this house that
the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) went too far
in expressing his opinions during this debate.
As I read his remarks in Hansard, he gave,
in a rather subtle way, the reasons why
he held these opinions. Well, I can assure
honourable senators, and particularly the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), that I have no intention of
doing either of these things. He may find out
which way I am thinking, but I am certainly
not going to give any reason in support
The honourable senator from
thereof.
Toronto-Trinity gave some friendly advice to
those of us who are to serve on this committee. He urged-I am quoting from
Hansard of February 4That we do not commit ourselves too much in

advance.
And that we:

keep an open mind.

That was mighty good advice, and the
only criticism I have to make of it is that
the honourable senator's advice was better
than his example.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am sorry my colleague
is not here, for I would not want to say
anything from which he might take offence.
The two of us, together with the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
worked closely together on the Special Committee on Banking and Commerce which
dealt with the revision of the Criminal Code.
During that time I formed a high regard for
the ability and faithful attention to work of
the honourable senator frorn Toronto-Trinity.
If he were here I would remind him of the
Sermon on the Mount: a man ought to cast
the bearn out of his own eye so as better to
see the mote in his brother's eye.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I interrupt to ask the
honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When discussing Standing
Order 65 of the House of Commons you referred to only one part-that part which deals
with the principle of a bill or other matter.

SENATE

I wonder if you would mind giving us the
whole order, for the way I read it I think it
deals with more than the principle.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That may be, but not in
the part that I read. I referred to the part
that suited my purposes.
The second heading on my list is: "Who are
to be the members on this committee?" So
that my honourable friend will be satisfied,
I will read Senate Rule 83 in its entirety:
The senators to serve on a Special committee may
be nominated by the mover; but, if three senators
so demand, they shall be selected as follows: Each
senator shall vote openly for one senator to serve
as a member of such committee, and those senators
for whom the largest number of votes are given
shall constitute the committee.

So, we are following strict precedent.
The third heading, the one I wish to discuss
at greater length, deals with the three subjects enumerated in this resolution for consideration by the joint committee, namely,
(a) capital punishment, (b) corporal punishment, and (c) lotteries. I am just wondering
how wise it was to include lotteries. I may
be wrong-I am thinking out loud-but the
problem of lotteries, it seems to me, is one for
the individual conscience to pass upon, rather
than a subject for study to be placed in the
same category as (a) and (b). However,
lotteries have been included, and I do not
want to say any more about that problem.
Honourable senators, another subject that
is tied right in with these problems is the
new Criminal Code Bill as drafted, passed
by this house and reintroduced into the House
of Commons last November. I refer particularly to sections 365 and 372. What called
my attention to this matter was a memorandum prepared by the Trades and Labour
Congress of Canada for this year, 1954. Under
the heading "Criminal Code", the memorandum says this:
We assume that parliament will deal further with
the revision of the Criminal Code during this
session. In this connection we would strongly urge
that sections 365 and 372 be approved in their
amended form as these were reported to the
House of Commons by the special committee during

the last session.

And I want to comment on the next paragraph:
We further recommend that the Criminal Code be
amended to allow Government-operated lotteries in
Canada.

So, in the minds of this large Canadian
labour organization those two subjects were
tied closely together. I think they were only
tied together in this sense, that each of them
involved controversies between the members
of the two bouses, but particularly controversies in connection with sections 365 and 372.

When this house passed the bill, after it had
come from our Banking and Commerce Committee, section 365 read as follows:
"Every one who wilfully breaks a contract know-

ing or having reasonable cause to believe that the
probable consequences of doing so, whether alone
or in combination with others, will be

(a) to endanger human life, ...

-I will confine myself to that part of the
sectionis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years.

Section 499 of the old Code was similar in
language, with a penalty of three months'
imprisonment, a surprisingly

small penalty

where the question of preservationi and safety
of human life is involved. Section 365, which
is substantially the same as the old section,
provides for a penalty of five years. When
that was before the Banking and Commerce
Committee-not before the subcommitteethere was also section 372, relating to mischief, and it is of the same tenor as section
365. Section 365 is applicable to a group of
men

who go on strike, knowing

that

the

strike is a breach of contract and endangers
human life.

Section 372 is substantially the

same as to mischief.

The honourable sena-

tor form Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)

moved an amendment

to section 372,

an

amendment which was very mild in comparison with the one that was carried in the
committee of the House of Commons. I am
reading from the proceedings of the Senate's

Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce:
The

Chairman:

Your suggestion was

that you

wanted to qualify section 372 by adding the provision that any lawful Act done in furtherance of
the purposes of a trade union would not be subject
to this section?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.

The rest of the members of the committee
were unanimous against the honourable
senator's proposed amendment.

Honourable senators, I think this is vital to
what we are considering, because I cannot see
anything except a straight impasse between

the two houses in this connection, and if that
is so I think it is unfortunate that this
matter was not included for deliberation
by the joint committee. I predict that sooner
or later some joint committee will have to
try to straighten it out. What took place
was this: a special committee was appointed
in the House of Commons, a large, competent
committee, and it had a large number of
representatives from labour organizations all

over Canada; as a result, this subsection was
added. The section says, "Every one who
wilfully breaks a contract"-knowing that it

will endanger human life-is guilty of an

Christ was quite an alert
psychologist. If he had wanted merely to
punish them for some time, he would not
have spoken thus.
Considerations of humanity are invoked
to save from capital punishment those who
kill. However, why should we not also
feel sorry for the one who was killed and
his relatives? But the point has been reached
when more compassion is shown for the
one who kills than the one who was killed.

or "Perhaps the murderer acted in anger",
or again: "Perhaps there are extenuating

extenuating circumstances the death penalty
may be commuted to life imprisonment. But
a man sentenced to a life term is generally
freed after fifteen years or so. Then he returns to civil life. If the death penalty is
completely abolished by law, nobody will
ever be hanged, and after a time a great
number of murderers will be set free to start
anew their life of crime, each saying to himself: "I have a good chance of not being
caught, but if I am I shall only spend another
fifteen years in the penitentiary. Nowadays
penitentiaries are fairly comfortable boarding
houses: there, one is fed, housed in heated
quarters and freed from worries. After all,
murder is a good way to get rid of somebody
one dislikes".
Several countries and many American
states where the death penalty was abolished
were mentioned. Nevertheless, our colleague
stated that the number of murders in the
United States is about five times greater
than in Canada. Then the names of thirteen
states were given, where capital punishment
has been abolished. This is not very forceful evidence in favour of such abolition. It
would be interesting to know, for instance,
how many countries have abolished capital
punishment to be forced to re-impose it
later on. If I am not mistaken, this has
happened in England. Other countries had
the same experience and I would like the
committee to investigate this aspect of the
question, in order to find out whether-taking
population into consideration-crime has decreased where the death penalty was
abolished, or whether it has increased.
I shall refrain from committing myself on
this subject, inasmuch as a committee is to
study it thoroughly. I wished only to point
out that it is always a difficult thing to
establish a comparison, because peoples are
different, each country having its own culture
and its own ideals.
Some seek mainly
pleasure, physical, material or sensual en-

joyment, while others place above everything
else their moral and spiritual welfare, and
this makes the greatest difference in the
world. I trust that the members of this
committee will approach this problem without
preconceived ideas, in the manner of jurymen who render their verdict on the evidence
adduced.
I conclude with this remark by Alphonse
Karr, which was quoted by Georges
"Let us abolish the death

TRANS-CANADA

AIR LINES FILM

INQUIRY AND

ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Reid inquired of the government:
1. Has Trans-Canada Air Lines completed, or is
in the process of completing a film?
2. If so, were any steps taken by them to have
such a film made by the National Film Board?
3. If the National Film Board was so requested,
what reason can be given for the National Film
Board not making the film?
4. What is the total cost, so far, in the making of
this film?
(a) Under what title is the film being produced?
(b) For what purpose is such a film being made?
5. Were any personnel, engaged for the making
of such a film, United States citizens?
If so,
what were their names and what remuneration did
they receive?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer to the
honourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
1. In September 1953 there was completed
for Trans-Canada Air Lines a public relations film which was the most recent release
of a series of nine 16 mm. films produced
over the last seven years.
2. No steps were taken to have the most
recent film produced by the National Film
Board, but that organization did produce two
of the company's previously released films,
namely "Wings Over Canada" and "A New
Map for Canada". The National Film Board
did make the master print fron the negative
of the most recently released film.
3. Not applicable-see answer to 2 above.
4. The total cost of the complete film was
$24,000.
(a) "No Barriers".
(b) The purpose of the film is to stimulate
interest in air travel in Canada, and in Canadian aviation generally, by a graphic representation of current commercial air activities,
including those of airlines other than TransCanada Air Lines.
5. The film was produced by the firm of
Lew Parry Film Productions of Vancouver,
and the citizenship status and remuneration
of their employees is not known to T.C.A.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I
wish to make a complaint, one which I have
often made before. In this chamber there is
an awful draft. There should be enough engineers in the service of the government to do
something about this draft, which is felt quite
strongly by those of us who sit on the Opposition side of the chamber. The day before
yesterday I went to the Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod and told him about the matter,
and he kindly had the fan turned off. For a
little while then the draft disappeared, but
today it is coming through just as strongly as
before. I think we are entitled to ask you,
Mr. Speaker, to direct that the engineers of
this building do something to overcome this
condition. It may be the result of a faulty
ventilation system, but I don't know why
the Opposition members have to be the
victims of it. There are not so many of us
that anybody needs to pick on us in this
way. Probably sornebody else could be ventilated, but we would prefer some chance
to survive. We have been told that we are
not likely to last much longer than this parliament, but I am sure that if this draft
continues ýthere will not be much of the
Opposition left after another year or two.
My honourable friend frorn Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Quinn) has been laid up with a
serious cold, which he caught right here. He
is here today, although I warned hirn yesterday not to come if he was not fully recovered,
because he would run the risk of getting
an even worse cold by coming. I also have
had a cold lately, and it is much more severe
today than it was yesterday or the day before.
I know I am a young fellow, but I cannot
stand this draft.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Could we switch it from
cold to hot air?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but I would like to
have it blow over on the Government side
for a little while. I think the engineers
should direct it towards that side for at least
half the time, and then we over here might
be able to stand our share of it. But, with
all due respect, Mr. Speaker, I would ask
you to see that arrangements are made to
have this draft stopped.
The Hon. the Speaker: I find it difficult to
believe that the draft falls upon the Opposition by anything more than coincidence. I

SENATE
to nearby points, nothing will be gained by
transporting it to an airport and carrying
it from there to its destination by air. In
these cases surface transportation will continue. But where mail delivery can be
accelerated through carriage by air it will
proceed, as I have said, in this way, and at
the rate of five cents instead of at the former
rate of seven cents. The local rate will apply
to mail posted or delivered on a rural mail
route when transported within a single postal
district. That is to say, if a rural mail
delivery emanates from a certain city and a
letter is mailed in that city to be delivered
along that rural mail route, it will be carried
at the city rate. Formerly, of course, it was
carried at the increased rate.
Honourable senators will be interested to
know of some increased services that have
been given to the public during the last ten
years. During that period the number of
cities having door-to-door deliveries have
increased from 89 to 127, and the number of
houses served by letter carriers has increased
by 750,000. Patrons served along rural routes
have increased from 290,000 to 410,000. In
other words, in that period individual service
has been given to 870,000 additional homes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That represents a lot of
mail.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) says, that is a
lot of mail. Postal service costs have gone
up tremendously.
Salaries of basic employees are up approximately 100 per cent,
but I do not think anyone here is unfavourable to these salary increases. The cost of
rail transportation of mail is up 100 per cent,
of mail carriage over water is up 300 per
cent, and of land mail service is up more than
150 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I asic the honourable
senator a question? He has mentioned increased services to the public during the last
ten years. I would point out that Canadian
cities and towns are getting only one delivery
a day now, whereas they used to get two.
In view of the proposed increase in rates is
there any prospect of our cities and towns
getting delivery twice a day?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Twice-a-day delivery
can be restored, of course, but the public
would have to expect further increased costs.
The bill before the house does not contemplate twice-a-day delivery being put back into
effect. This service may be restored some
time in the future, but the figures I have
given are based on one mail delivery a day.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am not quite clear as to
something the honourable leader said. That is
my fault, not his. Do I understand that part

of the revenue from the proposed increased
rates is intended to make up a deficit or
loss resulting from the elimination of stamps
on bank cheques?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what the honourable
leader said.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The removal of stamps
on cheques has resulted in a loss of $1
million, and that amount bas to be accounted
for. I know it is difficult to follow an explanation when so many figures are mentioned, but I have pointed out that last year
the Post Office Department had a surplus of
$6,500,000, and that the removal of stamps on
cheques resulted in a loss of $7,500,000, which
makes a net loss of $1 million. That amount
has to be provided for and is included in
the extra expense.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Would my honourable
friend give us those figures again?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Post Office Department had a surplus of $6,500,000. When
excise stamps on cheques were no longer required, the loss in revenue was $7,500,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How can that be determined? Many of the cheques bore postage
stamps and not excise stamps.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe more postage
stamps than excise stamps were affixed to
cheques, but I cannot say how many more.
If the bill is referred to committee, that
information can probably be obtained there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that last year
the Post Office Department lost $7 million
because excise stamps were not required on
cheques. I should like to know how that
amount is arrived at, because in my experience nearly all businesses used excise
stamps on cheques. People who drew only a
few cheques a year probably used postage
stamps. Is that loss computed on the reduced
sale of postage stamps resulting from abolition
of the tax on cheques?
Hon. Mr. Euler: That cannot be determined.
Hon. Mr. Haig: To arrive at an estimate
the two kinds of stamps would have to be
considered together; you could not separate
them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There seems to be a
difference of opinion. As the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was speaking
some senators near me said "That is
not correct". I do not think honourable
members would expect me to have detailed
information as to how removal of the cheque
tax affected the sale of postage stamps and
of excise stamps. As I have said, that
information can be obtained if the bill
goes to committee, and I recommend that it

FEBRUARY

should. We all know that the increased
costs I have mentioned will result in an
overall increase in the costs of the Post
Office Department. Now, how is the money
to be raised? One honourable senator says,
"Put the tax back on cheques". Another
says, "Oh, no, don't put it on cheques".
This bill proposes to meet the increased cost
by raising postal rates. Another way to
meet the increased cost would be to take the
amount out of the general revenue.
It
would then be a hidden tax. Personally, I
do not believe in that method. If money
is being expended to perform a service, I
think the people should know it and should
pay for the service that is being performed
for them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt
the leader, but he has referred only to the

question that could be asked in committee,

is only one issue, and it boils down to this:

SENATE
the postal rate is being increased by one cent
an ounce on first-class mail. That is the
issue.
I admit that there is a lot to be said for
the honourable leader's point that when
people are using a service they should know
what it is going to cost them. If that were
government policy throughout all the departments I would be wholeheartedly for it.
But, as honourable senators know, we have
a sales tax that the consumer knows nothing
about. Nobody knows where it is imposed
and nobody knows where the revenue from
it goes to. There are a number of taxes of
that kind.
N-ow, honourable senators, I am going to
tell you what I do not like about this increase
in the postal rates. The humble, ordinary
people of this country, many of them separated by great distances-in some cases by
the whole width of the country-carry on a
family corresp'ondence down through the
years. Correspondence of that nature makes
for a feeling of unity between one part of
Canada and the other. Let me illustrate. A
mother, say of the age of sixty, lives in Winnipeg. She has a married daughter in
Toronto, another in Montreal and another in
Saskatoon; a son married in Vancouver and
another in Edmonton. Now, what chiefly
maintains the unity of that family is the correspondence between the children and their
mother. The -old-home influence is kept alive
by the fact that the mother writes once a
week to each one of her children. There is
no better way on earth by which you can
preserve a flourishing family spirit in our
country than by correspondence. It enables
mothers and fathers to keep in touch with
their children-though fathers, as a rule, do
not write so frequently as mothers do. I
speak from personal experience. As long as
my mother lived, no matter where the different members of our family were livingand there were nine of us-a letter would
come to each of us on Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday morning. The letter brought me
right back home, and I found myself sitting,
as it were, listening to mother. It had a
similar effect on all members of our family.
And in my 'own family we had the same
experience: my wife wrote every week to
every one of our children, who were scattered throughout the dominion, and in that
way the home influence was maintained.
Now, if the people can afford these
increased postal rates, well and good. I say,
however, that a great many people cannot
afford them, because they are already having
a hard struggle to get by, especially those
who have reached the age of sixty and over.

This increase in postal rates is a burden that
will fall upon those who can least afford to
pay it.
I never did like the stamp tax on cheques,
notes, bills of exchange and the like. My
own firm, like a good many others, bought
excise stamps, but when we ran out of them
for a day or two we used to purchase ýthreecent postal stamps and affix them to cheques
and other documents. That was a nuisance
tax, I will admit, but there was a service
that we got through doing that.
The increase in postal rates will not make
much difference to big business, because it
will be added to the cost of doing business.
Take a lawyer, for example. In his fees
he includes all the costs entering into his
business activities-he must or he would
not be able to continue in practice. Consider, too, a mercantile house sending out
accounts. Does anyone think that the cost
of the extra postal rates will not be added
to their cost of doing business? The Hudson's Bay Company, Simpson's and Eaton's,
for example, certainly will add the increased
postal rates to their already existing costs.
But what about the people who are receiving a pension of $40 or $65 a month? There
are lots of them in this country, let me tell
you, lots of them. I met a locomotive engineer some months ago, when I was going
home from the session, I met a pensioned
locomotive engineer, and he told me that in
his opinion, something was wrong in this
country. He said that his pension from the
Canadian Pacific Railway is $65 a month, and
he compared that with the salary that his son
is drawing now for the same kind of job,
$400 a month. His pension, of course, was
based on the lower pay scale that prevailed
when he was working. That man's wife is
living, and does anyone mean to tell me that
increased postal rates will not be a tax on
them? That is the feature I do not like about
this.
I say quite candidly that at some place we
have got to draw the line and say to the government of this country, "You have got to
stop spending so much; you must cut down
This proposed increase is an

illustration of the attitude that is being
adopted by every department of the public
service, not only in the dominion jurisdiction
but in every province and in every municipality. The minute that costs are increased,
public bodies start to pass the increase on
to the taxpayer.
I like what the Minister of Trade and Commerce said yesterday, and I wish we had a
few more men like him in this country to tell
us about these kinds of things. The people

to be met by the people. In my part of the
country the five-day week is not of much
value to those who have it, except for three
or four months in the summer time. On holidays during the rest of the year all that
one can do is sit in the house.
I reiterate that I am opposed to an increase
in postal charges. I think it is wrong in
principle, because the ordinary person whom
this affects should not have to pay the higher
costs. In my opinion the government is
going about the matter in the wrong way. If
the postal service is running behind in its
receipts and more money has to be raised, it
had better be raised from the people who
are capable of paying for the increased costs.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is what will be
done under this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; the users of the
mails pay for the service.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that. But the only
way to correct a condition of this kind is by
getting the necessary increased revenue from
the people who have the income to pay for
the costs of the service. The situation would
then be brought home to them, and they
would ultimately say to the government:
"This expense is too high, and that expense
is too high, and must be reduced." Make no
mistake about it, that is what will finally
have to happen. Anybody who studies trade
reports will find out that we are not able to
sell all of our products in the imperial market
this year. Trade has fallen off. We are in
the red on our foreign trade. The price of
money has gone up in Canada because of the
large flow of investment money into this
country.
Honourable senators, I am against having
a nuisance tax such as this imposed on the
ordinary people, who can least afford it. I
say they simply cannot afford it. If the bill
goes to committee we shall want a lot of
questions answered, and I certainly will
oppose the legislation from first to last.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, at
this stage of the legislation, I would like to
make certain remarks. I will not deal with
the more controversial aspects of the bill
until it is being considered in committee, but
there are certain points about this proposal
that were not brought out during the long
debate in the other place. At the outset I

1954

want to say that I have a very high opinion
of the operation of the Post Office Department. In fact, I will go so far as to say that
if every other department of the government
were run as efficiently as the Post Office
Department, our taxes could be reduced.
That is my opinion, formed after long years
of experience.
I listened carefully to the honourable
leader's explanation, and I quite realize that
the money has to come from somewhere. The
granting of salary increases, the forty-hour
week, and the benefits to rural carriers are
things which no one would object to in this
day of high costs of living. But I propose
to give my opinion, as to the source from
which I think the money should come.
I know a little bit about the air mail service
in Canada, because I was chosen as the government representative to go on the flight
from Ottawa to the Pacific coast carrying the
first cargo of mail at the first-class rate. I
say without fear of contradiction that there
was no popular demand for air mail service.
On the contrary, the service was introduced
to increase the revenues of Trans-Canada
Air Lines. A little later the air lines appealed
to the Post Office Department for more money
to continue this service.
It was then decided between the postal
officials and T.C.A. that if costs increased to
$5 million or $6 million, space would have to
be allocated in the planes to take a certain
quantity of mail-as the officials say, sixmillion ton miles. From that time until the
present a letter carrying the regular firstclass postage has been given air transport to
any point in Canada where there is an airport. But mail is taken only if there is space
in the aircraft. However, first-class mail that
carries a seven-cent air mail stamp and a
sticker is given priority and assured of air
transport.
The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in his explanation pointed out that
the post office carried 1,500 million pieces
of mail. Let us consider how that mail is
classified, what is taken by air and what
by train, and how it is distributed. I would
point out to honourable senators the rather
surprising figure supplied by the postal department, that only 25 per cent of our first class
mail is carried by air. From last years' figures
given by the leader, it appears that 375
million pieces of first-class mail went by
air, while 1,125 million were carried by surface delivery.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would be shortcarriage mail.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Now, the greatest volume
of mail is not distributed by air to far-off
points, but within cities. Had we a map of

forthcoming.

FEBRUARY
It has been suggested that government
departments should buy stamps, and that
franking ought to be done away with. At
the moment I am not going to discuss this
matter, nor some other aspects of expenditure
which have been mentioned, such as the
public buildings which have been and are
being supplied by the Department of Public
Works for post offices. But I cannot help
thinking, as I see the stuff that comes to
my desk, that a very great deal could be
done to reduce outlays both on paper and on
mailing. The time has come to put the post
office on a proper business basis and to let
us and the people of the country know where
are the losses, and where the profits. I
agree with the leader's views, though I
arrive at my decision in a different way, that
those who get the benefits should pay for
them. But that result will not be reached
merely by raising the charge to 5 cents per
letter at the beginning of May. I rise to
protest and to place my views on the record
in the hope that when the bill is sent to
committee we shall get more detailed information. I am reserving my final stand until
the bill comes before us for third reading.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I have a few remarks to make about
this bill, and I shall endeavour to be as
brief as possible.
In the first place, I think that this increase
of postal rates might have been obviated if
the government in its wisdom had seen fit
to retain the stamp on cheques and the radio
licence fee. There was no great demand
for the removal of either the stamp or
the fee; and I believe, that, if they had not
been abolished, we should not have been
faced with the figures which are now before
us. However, I am not objecting seriously
to the increased rates.
I have great sympathy with the views
expressed by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) to the effect that the increased
charge will fall upon many people who will
find the extra cent rather burdensome. But
what I object to more than anything else is
that the 4-cent stamp now required, and the
5-cent stamp which will be necessary if this
bill passes, as it undoubtedly will, are not
of equal value to everyone. The 4-cent
stamp, for instance, has a greater value to
people who are getting two or three deliveries
a day than to those who, living in residential
sections of the larger cities, have only one
delivery a day.
Furthermore, when we speak of sending
by air practically all our mail which can be
more expeditiously carried that way, we
must remember that from one end of Canada
83280-17

11, 1954

to the other there are very few postal airports. If for business purposes I want to
send a letter to Winnipeg, that letter must
still go to Toronto by surface mail, and then
be conveyed to the airport and carried by air
mail to its destination. But if a letter is
posted to Winnipeg by a business man in
Toronto it is flown direct to Winnipeg, and
probably will get there twenty-four hours
sooner than my letter, posted in Kingston,
170 miles away.
I hope that before long the two deliveries
a day will be restored. I agree with the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that
this would be expensive, but I think the
people are entitled to it. I cannot agree that
it is more important that businesses in the
centre of a large city-Toronto, for instance
-should have three deliveries a day than
that the people in residential sections should
have more than one. What happens to letters
from Kingston? The train which leaves that
city at half-past six carries a certain amount
of mail. Most business houses have their mail
in the post office before 5 o'clock, and it is
supposed to go, and I believe it does go, on
the 6.30 train. But quite a number of business men in Kingston do not get their letters
written in time to catch that train; they
write them after supper. Many times I have
gone to the post office at 10 o'clock in the
evening and met other business men posting
letters to Toronto, or Montreal. What happens
to these letters?
I agree that the post office is run effleiently.
I make no complaint on that score: it is the
system that I object to. On trains running
through Montreal and Toronto there are mail
clerks, and as the mail comes on at Montreal, Kingston, Belleville and Oshawa, they
sort it, so that it is ready for distribution,
and if the train gets in on time the mail
goes straight to the postman or into the
little green boxes. But if the train should
be half an hour late, that cannot be done,
with the result that people outside the business section of Toronto do not receive their
mail for another twenty-four hours, as there
is only one delivery per day in the residential sections. So, for instance, if a letter is
posted at Kingston on Wednesday night, and
the mail arrives in Toronto half an hour
late, it is not delivered in the residential
section of Toronto before Friday morning. It
seems to me that that is far too long a time
to transport and deliver letters over a distance of only 170 miles. I hope the day will
soon come when smaller cities such as
Kingston will enjoy the benefits of airmail
service. There is an airport in Kingston, but
there is no airmail service, and the absence
of this service often causes considerable
delay in postal deliveries.

SENATE
The honourable gentleman from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) spoke about
second-class mail, making special reference to
newspapers. I am afraid that he has been
ill-informed. Many people have the idea that
newspapers are subsidized by the government, but this impression is entirely false as
far as daily newspapers are concerned. In
point of fact, it is the newspaper subscriber,
the reader, who is subsidized. It costs a
certain amount to produce a newspaper and
an additional amount to deliver it. City
delivery boys-little merchants, we call them
-buy newspapers and deliver them at so
much per week to subscribers living within
an area of perhaps three or four blocks.
When newspapers are delivered by mail, the
postal costs are added to the subscription
rate.
The Post Office Department once charged
daily newspaper publishers a bulk rate of
4 cents a pound. When Mr. R. B. Bennett
come into power he thought this rate was
too low-and I think perhaps he was rightand increased it to 13 cents a pound. This,
of course, increased subscription rates for
persons getting their newspaper by mail.
Subsequent to the raising of this rate by Mr.
Bennett a new Post Office Department regulation was put into effect whereby a newspaper had to pay a higher rate if advertising
material occupied more than 50 per cent of
its space. That regulation was altered on
June 30, 1951, when the rates were put on
a more business-like basis. Since that time
newspaper postal rates have been on a
straight commercial basis, as it were.
This is how the postal charges are arrived
at. The daily newspapers notify the local
post office authorities each day how many
papers they are sending by mail, and report
the percentage of advertising content and
news content in the paper. The present rate
is 2' cents per pound on news and 4 cents
for each pound of advertising material. Let
me give the house an illustration. On Thursday, February 4, the Kingston Whig Standard
devoted 56 per cent of its space to advertising and only 44 per cent to news, but on
Monday, February 8-Mondays are not big
days for daily newspapers-the same paper
published a sixteen-page edition, devoting
only 38 per cent of its space to advertising,
and 62 per cent to news. On both these occasions, of course, we paid the postal rate of 2ý
cents per pound on news and 4 cents for each
pound of advertising material.
The honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) also said something
about a certain class of publications, secondclass mail, being carried free within a fortymile zone. Well, as far as I can remember

there never was any such thing as a fortymile free zone as far as daily newspapers
are concerned. I will admit, however, that
weekly newspapers have enjoyed free delivery within a zone of twenty miles of where
they are published. Canadian newspapers
have been printing a great deal of correspondence about this proposed increase in postal
rates, and reference has been made to the
unfairness of the twenty-mile zone. I have
not got one dollar invested in weekly newspapers, but I would be sorry indeed to see
privilege taken away from them. We must
remember that if the weekly newspapers
have to pay postage within the twenty-mile
limit the cost will eventually come out of the
pocket of the subscriber. I think those of us
who have lived in small towns are familiar
with the way mail is handled in the local post
offices. The weekly newspapers are sorted
out by the post office clerk and placed in
mail boxes, to be picked up by the subscribers. There are no door-to-door postal
deliveries in small villages and towns where
weekly papers are read; therefore the cost
to the department of handling these publications is small. My own experience is that 50
per cent of the circulation of weekly newspapers is in our towns and villages. If the
postal rate were raised and the free zone
dono away with, the weeklies would undoubtedly have to increase their subscription rates
and, as a result, they would lose some subscribers.
I have a warm spot in my heart for Canada's
weekly papers, for I feel they are doing a
splendid job in keeping the record of rural
communities. There has been a tremendous
improvement in these publications over the
last twenty years, and cups and trophies are
awarded for the best editorials, front pages,
and so on. Despite the good job these papers
are doing, however, they are not making
much money. I know, for I struggled with
weekly newspapers for a number of years,
and I can assure honourable members that it
was pretty tough going. Conditions are somewhat better today, but it must be remembered
that competition from daily newspapers was
never as keen as it is now. Likewise, competition against small-town daily newspapers
from metropolitan and semi-metropolitan
newspapers has never been so keen.
Honourable senators, I feel that there could
be some improvement in the mail service
between metropolitan centres and what the
railroads call way stations. I would like
to see the Post Office Department give consideration to inaugurating an air mail service
at least once a day in the provincial towns
of this country. I have no criticism to make

FEBRUARY

as to the administration of the Post Office
Department itself. I think it is well run. I
am familiar, of course, with the operation
of the post office in Kingston, and I have had
long talks with the postmaster of Toronto.
I must say that I was disappointed that
when the city of Toronto was building its
new subway from north of St. Clair avenue
down to Front street the Post Office Department did not take advantage of the opportunity to install pneumatic tubes. These could
be used to transmit mail from the branch
post offices in the north end of the city to
the main office on Front street. Even fifty
years ago this system was employed in New
York city: at that time mail was dispatched
by pneumatic tubes from the post office
at Madison Square to the main office near
the Battery. It is a shame to think that
during the building of the new subway in
Toronto nothing has been done along this
line. When the new subway is completed,
it will take eight minutes to go north from
Front street to St. Clair avenue. I hope
the Post Office Department will make some
arrangement with the subway people to carry
mail from the branch post offices along the
line, and just west of it, in order to get it
down to the main post office much more
quickly than at present. The service out of
Toronto is not very bad; in fact, I think it
is rather good. In the residential districts,
if a letter is posted by a quarter past five
in the afternoon it will be delivered in such
cities as Brantford, St. Catharines, Kingston
and Kitchener, the next morning. If a letter
is posted after that time it might catch the
night train, but that is not guaranteed. However, if you go to the main post office, which
is a very, very efficient organization, you
can post the letter directly on to a moving
leather belt, and it will be conveyed to the
sorting room and be ready for the night train
in a short time. I have no doubt that other
cities-Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver and
others-are given equally efficient service. A
lady told me she took 23 big food parcels
for Britain to the general Post Office in
Toronto, at Christmas time and that they were
ail weighed and stamped and she was out of
the Post Office within five minutes. I think
that is very, very good service. Unfortunately
service of that type seems to be limited to
a great extent to the larger cities.
That is about ail I have to say, honourable
senators. I wanted ta correct the misinformation that seems ta be abroad about weekly
newspapers. I wanted ta inform the bouse
that the rate of postage for daily newspapers
bas been put upon a proper commercial basis,
without any bill coming before this house or

the other place. I also wanted to suggest
that we should have a better air mail service
to smaller places as soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I should like to ask the
honourable senator two questions. First, am
I to understand that no loss is sustained by
the department in connection with the daily
newspaper service?
Hon. Mr. Davies: I cannot answer that, but
at the present rate I do not think there would
be. If there is a loss and the rate to the
daily newspapers is still not high enough, the
price of the paper to the subscriber would
go up.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My second question is
this. Why should any losses incurred by the
department in giving service to second-class
mail users be imposed on the users of firstclass mail?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a good question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the issue.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I think that is a very
good question. I do not think there is any
reason at ail. I understand that the honourable leader made no reference ta any change
in second-class mail?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I understood from what
the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said that there is a
loss of $15 million in giving service for
second-class mail. If that is so, I am wondering why that loss should be borne by
users of first-class mail.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Second-class mail is not
restricted ta newspapers and magazines, it
includes all unsealed letters and that sort of
thing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And advertising.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Yes, and advertising.
The post offices handle advertising now in
opposition ta newspapers. For instance, they
will take a big pile of advertising material,
unaddressed, and give it ta the postmen, wha
will deliver it. I was always under the
impression that in the old days the loss was
due partly ta the carrying of newspapers
and magazines at low rates, and partly ta
rural routes.
It is an interesting fact,
although I do not know if it has any effect
on the mail, that the magazine Life, published in New York, does not use the mails
ta Canada. Each issue is shipped in large
transports ta Montreal and dumped into the

SENATE
post office there. I do not know if it is
cheaper to do it that way than by mail.

TRANS-CANADA HIGHWAY
INQUIRY

ANSWERED

Hon. Mr. Reid inquired of the Government:
Of the $42,777,242.73 contributed by the Federal
Government since 1950, towards the construction of
the Trans-Canada Highway, how much of this
amount was spent in each province under the 100
per cent payable by the Federal Government for
that portion of the Trans-Canada Highway in
National Parks.

Hon. Mr. Lambert (for Hon. Mr. Macdonald): I have a reply to the questions of
the honourable senator, as follows:
Nil.
The amount of $42,777,242.73 contributed
by Canada toward the cost of construction of
the Trans-Canada highway represents payments made to the provinces only as Canada's
share (50 per cent) of provincial costs.
In addition to the above, Canada has paid
100 per cent of construction cost of the TransCanada highway in Banff and Yoho National
Parks. The total amount paid from 1950 to
January 31, 1954, is $1,203,079.25.
Of that amount $67,895.41 was spent on
location surveys and engineering investigations in both Alberta and British Columbia
parks, a breakdown of which amount is not
possible. However, in so far as contracts
awarded are concerned, $698,003.22 was spent
in Alberta (Banff park) and $437,180.62 in
British Columbia (Yoho park).
POST OFFICE BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 11, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Macdonald for the second reading of Bill 168, an Act to amend the Post
Office Act.
Hon. J. A. Bradette: Honourable senators,
I fully realize that the bill before us, No.
168, an Act to amend The Post Office Act,
has been fully discussed in the House of
Commons. However, I believe this is the
time to present some observations, based on
my experience and opinions.
All of us realize that a bill of this kind is
not overly popular, for the reason that from
time to time government departments have
to increase the rate on some services they
are giving; and generally speaking, the vote
on such a measure is mainly on party lines.

But I do not think that anyone can accuse
the government of lacking either sincerity or
courage in its action on this matter.
It bas been stated during the present debate
that, had the stamps on cheques been maintained, probably

it

would

not have

been

necessary to raise the cost of first-class postal
service. The argument which has been used
in this discussion has been that the tax on
stamps was borne by certain classes of people
who had occasion to use cheques most
frequently. I cannot agree entirely with that
point of view. It is true that big corporations,
issuing a large number of cheques, require
more stamps, but the charge was borne also
by thousands upon thousands of small businesses throughout the country, and by some
quarter of a million people possessing savings
accounts. For these, the stamp charge may
have been pretty onerous, and what may be
called a nuisance tax. It is now abolished
and, of course, the government, and in particular the postal department, must face the
consequent deficit.
It has also been argued during the present
session that the radio licence fee should not
have been abolished. However, we all know
how costly it was to collect this fee. In many
instances the owners of radio sets were found
to be several years in arrears in the payment
of the fee through negligence or forgetfulness,
and they had the unpleasant experience of
being dragged before local magistrates. In
my own home town thirty-six persons appeared before the magistrate in one day, two
years ago, for having forgotten to pay their
radio fee. I was opposed to the fee ever
since its inception, and I was certainly pleased
when it was abolished.
The type of legislation now before the
house is never popular with the voters. The
present government bas done many things
that were unpopular at the start, but eventually the citizens of this country realized that
the government had acted properly. Just look
at Canada's economic situation today. One has
only to travel in the United States, Europe or
Asia to realize how much the people of those
countries envy Canada's economic situation.
We are one of the very few nations in the
world which have drastically reduced their
national debt since the last war. The heavy
taxation and rationing regulations imposed
on Canadians during the war were certainly
not very enthusiastically accepted, although
loyally adhered to, by the people of this country, and after the war the taxpayers were
critical when subsidies on milk were withdrawn. Everyone recalls the bad publicity
the government drew on that occasion, and
which was politically exploited. It was said

FEBRUARY

that this measure was not fair to the consumers and that it would result in people
being deprived of their milk. There was further criticism throughout every section of the
country when controls were gradually
removed from most of the items on which they
had been imposed during the last war. I
can understand why this action was criticized
in a political way, and the opposition parties
certainly endeavoured to build up a certain
measure of political capital out of that situation. I believe that this is the time to state
that the people I represented in those days
were made well aware of the courage, determination and foresight of the government's
action at that time, which in all instances
proved to be logical.
Honourable senators, I listened with a great
deal of attention and interest to the remarks
made during this debate by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). He made a fine
speech, and stated that he was going to vote
against this measure. I do not believe he
could do otherwise. The honourable gentleman spoke with sincerity, and he built up
an apparently good case. He referred to the
humble, ordinary citizens of this country who
carry on family correspondence with their
relatives. By way of illustration he spoke of
a mother living in Winnipeg, for instance,
and having five children living in various
localities throughout the dominion. He stated
that such mothers will be penalized as a result
of this legislation; that their budgets will be
somewhat affected. I took a piece of paper
and pencil and endeavoured to ascertain just
what the difference would be, with an increase
of one cent on- each letter. If the mother
writes to her five children once a week she
will spend $2.60 more a year for stamps. If
she writes twice a month to her five children
the increase in the cost of stamps will be
$1.30 a year. If she writes only once to each
of her children each month the annual
increase will be 60 cents. Surely she should
be able to bear this extra cost.
Honourable senators, I want to remind the
house that the burden here will be spread,
shared by big and small businesses as well as
by individual citizens. The load has to be
carried somewhere, and I feel the government
is acting courageously and practically.
I also listened attentively to the remarks
of the honourable senator from Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies), who presented a good case on
behalf of newspaper publishers. I was pleased
to hear his viewpoint, particularly with
respect to second-class mail, and particularly
the daily newspapers.
Before I proceed further I wish to say
that in some sections of Canada, and particularly in the large urban centres, mail is

18, 1954

delivered three times a day. Certainly, those
sections are very fortunate, like preferred
sons of the gods, because some sections in
my part of the country do not receive mail
once a month. We do not begrudge the
urban centres their service, but I wish to
point out to the honourable senator that we
are not getting delivery of mail three times
a day, 'or anything like that service, in my
part of the country, and we are very glad to
have the service we do. In many sections
mail is not delivered more than once a
month, and in others three times a year.
I must take this opportunity to compliment the Post Office Department upon the
magnificent work they are doing, because it
is difficult to give adequate mail service in
this country, where the population is spread
over an immense territory, and in parts of
which the population is very small as yet
and living in frontier settlements. In the
sparsely populated areas the mail service is
very good and meets with little criticism. I
think the Post Office Department, the
administration itself, and all its employees,
in whatever capacity they work, are to be
complimented; they are trying to do the best
they can.
The honourable senator from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies), in speaking about secondclass mail, contended that it was the readers
of newspapers, not the newspapers, who are
subsidized by the government. I think this
must be true. For example, I subscribe to
the two Ottawa daily newspapers, and they
cost me $10 a year. In this way, I receive
the papers for three and one-third cents and
three and one-half cents, and I certainly get
full value for my money. It has always been
a revelation to me what good value we get
from newspapers for such a small sum. There
is good reason for maintaining the subsidies
granted by parliament to the people who buy
newspapers; the public is thereby enabled
to get good and informative reading matter
at a very low rate. Every newspaper is
certainly good value for the money. I would
have to spend two hours on every issue to
get the most out of my newspapers: there
are editorials, local, national and international news items, and a weekly magazine
and other attractions. I think the government has acted rightly. Some people ask
why that kind of subsidy should be maintained, when the radio to some extent is
taking the place of the newspaper. But the
news that we hear over the radio at night,
we look for eagerly in print next morning.
That is true of all the news. I think that
the necessity for granting subsidies to newspapers that obtained years ago exists as
strongly today and should be continued.

Hon. Mr. Euler: And nobody else does.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: I do not have occasion
to write more than five or ten letters a day,
but I should like to make a maximum calculation to answer some newspapers of this
country that have printed a lot of exaggeration, stating that the franking privilege costs
Canada millions of dollars. The honourable
senator from Waterloo is quite correct when
he suggests that most parliamentarians do
not write thirty letters a day.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What about the tons of
Hansard that are sent out under the frank?
Hon. Mr. Bradette: I will come to that
point later. Honourable senators will readily
see how misleading it is for citizens to read
-articles such as the one to which I have
referred indicating that the franking privileges cost the country some millions of dollars.
Towards the end of the article this paragraph appears:
The taxpayer might well speculate that the
volume of mail sent out by members, ministers,
and departnents would be substantially reduced if
postal charges always had to be paid, with a further
reduction in printing costs.
In my long experience as a member of the
House of Commons scarcely a week went by
that I did not hear a member asking the government for more information on some subject. It is true that parliamentarians as a
rule are not able to read all the information
that comes to them from the various governmental departments, but for my part I found
all the literature I received most interesting,
of some value and very helpful. I am quite
sure that honourable senators who have
served as members of the cabinet were satisfied that there was no extravagance under
their administration in the matter of distribution of information. If the privilege of
sending out information under the frank
were withdrawn or drastically curtailed much
criticism would come from members of the
other place. One has only to read some of
the speeches delivered during the last general
election campaign to appreciate the need for
the distribution of facts. For instance, it
has been stated that the Leader of the official Opposition should have the services of
a special bureau so that he would have
access to as much information about the
country's affairs as the government has.
I regard it as a great privilege to have
served the country as a member of both
houses, and I have always found that through
83280-18

the medium of distribution of literature under
the franking privilege I have had access to
most of the information I required.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) made reference to
the franking right of members of parliament,
and their use of it in mailing political
literature. There is a great deal to be said
in favour of his remarks and I, for one,
would be very much in favour of cancelling
this right to some degree. To give an example
of what is done along these lines, I would
like to relate an incident. On one occasion
some years ago, when I was a member of
the other house, my secretary was working on
a large bundle of brown envelopes. I had
no objection to her helping somebody else,
but I happened to ask her what she was
doing and she replied that she was addressing
some of the six thousand envelopes in which
literature was to be sent by members of
parliament to addresses in the western provinces. I informed her that I did not object
to her doing secretarial work, but I did object
to her doing that monotonous work. If it
can be shown that there are abuses of the
franking privilege I would be the first to
suggest that the privilege be abolished. I
may say that that question was given very
serious consideration a few years ago but
no conclusion was reached.
I hope and pray that the press will find
it possible to go to the bottom of this question of franking rights for parliamentarians,
and publish the real facts for the benefit of
their readers. I repeat, I am not going to
criticize the subsidies given to the readers
of newspapers in this country, because I
think every cent of those subsidies is deserved. In many families, the only reading
matter is a weekly, bi-weekly, or daily paper
and magazines, and if the readers of those
publications are able to purchase them at a
reasonable price they will buy not only one
paper, but may buy two or more, and, as a
result, they will be in a better position to
form an unbiased opinion on political matters,
both national and international.
Again I say that I hope very sincerely
that the press will try to depict exactly what
the situation is and refrain from publishing
insinuations, for there will be criticism
heaped on the heads of parliamentarians because of the statements contained in the
press that the franking right costs the country
millions of dollars yearly.
I ask your indulgence if I speak plainly
on this matter, but I must do so, for I feel
strongly on the subject: I believe in criticising the actions of the government and the
party in power. The press has a duty to

his frank, is thirty, and on that basis he The proposed increase in the postage rates,

FEBRUARY 16, 1954

applicable from April 1, 1954, is for one specifie purpose, mainly to cover foreseeable
increased expenditure. This has been indicated by the Postmaster General as follows:
(a) Upward adjustment of salaries paid
to post office employees, including the
postmaster of rural post offices, staff
offices, railway mail clerks, administrative staffs, etc. ..................
$7,000,000
(b) An additional amount required to
apply the 5-day 40-hour week in those
offices where it is the dominant pattern
in industry ...........................
5,000,000
(c) Increases in rates to mail contractors,
including rural mail couriers on the
lines of the legislation passed last
year ...................................
1,500,000

$13,500,000

In addition, I notice that, for the cost of
railway transportation, the Post Office estimates for 1954-55 provide-at page 418-for
$15,360,000, or an increase of $1,250,000 over
the amount provided in 19,53-54. If you add
this to the $13,500,000 already stated there is
a total increase for the next fiscal year of
$14,750,000.
I notice that the Postmaster General estimates that the additional revenue due to the

increased cost of postage will be $15,000,000,

or approximately the amount of foreseeable
additional expenditures. One might ask why
this is necessary in view of the fact that there
was a surplus for the fiscal year 1952-53 of
approximately $6,500,000.
The reason is, as the Postmaster General has
already explained, that this surplus has
entirely disappeared on account of the discontinuance of the use of postage stamps on
cheques, and that, instead of there being a
surplus this year, there will be a deficit of at
least $1,000,000.
The fiscal year is not yet completed, and I
understand the indications are that the actual
deficit will be appreciably in excess of
$1,000,000. These figures are taken from the
official records.
It is my opinion that, while additional
expenditure frequently keeps pace with the
estimated revenue, there are revenue increases
at the rate of about 5 to 7 per cent a year; and
I predict, on the basis of past experience, that
the department might get through the next
year without a deficit.
There has been some criticism of this bill
on the ground that the whole burden of
increased charges is placed on first-class mail.
Well, no other agency than the government
can carry letters; it has a monopoly in this
regard, and it is really the only place where it
has a free field. The postage on letters is to
be increased from 4 to 5 cents, but all firstclass mail, and some packages, if folded and
enclosed in a suitable fashion, can be carried
in the same way.
83280-18J

I think it is very important for the progress
of the country that the mail should be conveyed as rapidly as possible. Canada is a
land of great distances. To mention my own
case, if I mailed a letter tonight, and it
went by rail, it would take two or three days
to reach Lunenburg; but if I posted it before
9 o'clock on a mailing day it would be in
my office in Lunenburg at 12 o'clock the following day. That is a splendid service.
I have been paying 7 cents on my letters
because no business man today who wants to
do things quickly, in keeping with the times,
will send a letter by the railway when it can
go by air. The price for this service, hitherto
7 cents, will be 5 cents; and the only proviso
in this connection is that letters will be sent
by air if it is advantageous to do so. Mail
addressed to places to which air service is
not available or to which it would not speed
delivery, will continue to go by rail, but
wherever the business of the country can be
done more efficiently by air transportation,
correspondence will be carried by air.
Coming to the matter of second-class mail:
there has been a pointed discussion in the
other place as to this class of mail being
carried at a deficit. Well, deficits are sometimes misleading. You need so much business
to carry your overhead; what you get over
and above it makes a difference. Everybody
knows that that extra volume has a great deal
to do with success in business. Though the
percentage of profit is less, it is good business
because it is obtained after most expenses
have been provided for. Many business transactions do not realize a profit in themselves,
but still they are good business. Competition
is becoming increasingly keen in the matter
of second-class mail. The large daily newspapers in Nova Scotia deliver their papers
by truck to various centres throughout the
province, where delivery boys pick them up
and deliver them at the subscribers' homes.
This service has speeded up newspaper deliveries to the extent that subscribers in my area
get their papers at 8 o'clock in the morning
instead of at 12 o'clock noon. Newspapers
are being delivered by this method all over
Canada, and this competition is difficult to
meet.
Honourable senators realize there is an
international responsibility in the matter of
mail service, and that there is an obligation
on the part of our Post Office Department to
deliver mail addressed to Canadians from
points in the United States, Britain or any
other country. Canada is a country of only
14 million people, whereas Britain has a
population of some 50 million and the United
States a population of 160 million. It is
the duty of our Canadian postal system to
deliver the myriad nieces of mail that come

SENATE
into this country from elsewhere in the world.
Then, again, I am told that, for example,
copies of Life magazine are brought by carriage to a point in Canada, from where they
are mailed to different places throughout this
country. At least in that way some postage
is paid. Magazine publishers transport magazines to a central point in Canada by carriage before mailing them because this system
has resulted in greater subscriptions, and. they
feel they can control delivery more effectively.
Mail deliveries in Britain cover comparatively short distances, and a letter posted
there can be delivered anywhere in the
country in good time. Despite this fact the
British postal rates are not much lower than
ours. I would also point out that there is a
$700 million deficit resulting from United
States mail service. I should like now to
quote a news item appearing in Time magazine of February 15, 1954. It is headed "From
the Committees", and reads:

working hours have paradoxically, been the
very ones to complain whenever a public
service seeks to increase its charges. How
can anyone obtain an extended service without paying for it? Certainly it is obvious
that you cannot get something for nothing.
It is said that those who use the mails should
pay for them. That is sound reasoning, and
we shall be on good ground if we adhere to
that idea.
Some people say that the regulation for
placing stamps on cheques should not have
been removed. Frankly, I cannot see any
connection between the Post Office Department and the matter of placing stamps on
cheques. This was a wartime measure introduced for the purposes of raising extra
revenue. In administering the regulation it
was found that excise stamps were sometimes hard to obtain in many parts of the
country. A businessman prefers an excise
stamp to ordinary stamps, for obvious

it is a good thing. Big business has brought
about a high standard of living and has made
countries prosperous and successful through
the ages. I tbink big business is good for
Canada. I do not like to see big businesses
operate as monopolies, I think they should be
controlled; but I do think that we should
stand by the big industries of this country.
Nevertheless, I believe they should pay their
share, for in a country where everybody
is free, people should pay for the individual
services they get. It is not too rnuch to ask
everybody to bear a portion of this extra
service cost. It is part of the price of progress.
I corne now to the matter of franking.
Franking costs this country a lot of rnoney.
The Post Office Department says that it costs
$4,100,000 per year. Well, it is not the
franking that members of parliamnent do that;
is 50 costly, but rather what the administrative branch does. There has been sorne criticismn of the raising of the sessional indernnity,
but the added expense amounts to less than
$1,500,000 i both bouses of parliament, yet
the loss to the Post Office Department from
the franking privilege -amounts to $4,100,000.
Sorne people say the franking privilege should
be abolished. 1 do not say it shouid; but I
do know it has been abused in rnany quarters.
1 know that people use it when they should
not, and that it is used for purposes that
can be questioned. Although it would be
a drastic act to abolish the privilege, I think
that question could be reviewed by a parliamentary cornmittee with good resuits for al
of us.
The Post Office Department had a surplus
last year of $6,471,053, but that arnount
would not be so large if the arnount lost by
the removal of the excise staxnp tax were
deducted.
Furthermore, that arnount does
not reflect accumulation of surpluses over
the years. That goes to the Consolidated
Revenue Account. In business, on the other
band, such a surplus could be used inx an
emergency, or to stabilize the balance sheet.
Then we are told that the Post Office
Department uses many buildings in Canada.
Post Office buildings, so cailed, are not
exclusively post office buildings at ail, but
are used for Customns and for Public Works,
the Fisheries and other departmnents. They
are really buildings for the purpose of collecting thre revenue of thre country and for
looking after other departmnents of government rather than for the Post Office alone.
The government savings bank carried on by
the Post Office bas deposits of $38 rnillion.
That amount is increasing each year, and

the rate of interest is 2 per cent. What
would a trust cornpany do with $38 million
if it had that arnount under its control? It
would do a rnighty good business and rnake
a good profit. An advantage that thre governrnent receives from. tbe Post Office
Department is tbe borrowing of this money,
50 to speak, from the Post Office savings
bank.
It seems to me that tbe Post Office Department is justified in irnposing a slight increase
or rearrangement in postage, and that tbe
Postrnaster General is justified in presenting
this bull to parliarnent. I thinli tbat thre reasonable people of tis country will be al
for it. If thre services are wanted, they
must be paid for. I know of no department

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT

OF FIVE-DAY

AT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I wish to draw the attention of the
house to a move by the Post Office Department that is being regarded in some quarters
as unfair discrimination. According to the
list that was published in the House of
Commons Hansard of yesterday, some of the
smaller towns in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta are listed for the institution of the
forty-hour week by various departments of
the federal government, whereas certain
larger places are not shown on the list at all.
We know that the Civil Service Commission
is making a continuous inquiry into these
matters, but my information is that in at
least one city in Alberta no such inquiry by
that body was made at ail. The place that I
have in mind is Medicine Hat. That is a
larger centre, which it seems to me should
be on the government's list for the forty-hour
week. The employees of practically all other
large organizations in the city are on the
forty-hour week, including employees of the
provincial government, the city, the five
banks, the clay product industries in the
area, and the Canadian Pacific Railway. I
draw this matter to the attention of honourable senators because a lot of unfavourable
comment has been created and nothing will
convince the employees of the Medicine Hat
post office that they are not being discriminated against.
POST OFFICE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Macdonald for the second reading of Bill 168,
an Act to amend the Post Office Act.

FEERUARY 17, 1954
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, this
bill is a very brief, innocent-looking measure.
It does flot extend beyond sixteen or seventeen lines. 1 submit, however, that there is
embedded in it a principle that is indeed of
far-reaching importance. The criticism may
be offered that this bill does flot carry any
explanation.
Someone entirely lacking in
imagination has set down under the heading
"Explanatory Notes" a statement that is flot
an explanation at ail. It does flot give a bit
of information beyond what one discovers
upon reading the bill itself. It would have
been useful to members of parliament had
the explanatory notes contained some detailed
explanation of the amount of money that is
necessary to be secured, how it is proposed
to secure it, and why it is necessary to secure
it. That information is entirely lacking. It is
true that the Leader of the Governiment (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) explained the purpose of
this bill when he moved its second reading
in this chamber. I believe the Postmaster
General did likewise when explaining the bill
in the other house.
Briefly, the purpose of the bill is to increase
the postage rate on first-class mail. The
postage on letters to be delivered within one
postal area will be increased one cent for
the first ounce or fraction of an ounce, and
postage on letters to be delivered between
cities and other communities will be increased one cent per letter. One reason we
have been given for increasing these rates
is that some time ago the government gave
a substantial increase in salaries to civil
servants, including post office employees. A
second and more compelling reason given is
that the Post Office Department instituted
a five-day forty-hour week, which. necessitated greatly increasing the department's
staff in order to handie its business. The
extra employees have to be paid, and consequently more money has to be found somewhere if the department is not to run at a
loss. Two minor reasons were also given:
an increase ini the remuneration of revenue
postmasters, who I believe work on a commission basis, and an increase in pay to rural
mail carriers. I have no fault to find with
these increases, and it may be that the increase in the civil servants' salaries was
unavoidable, although I amn bound ta say I
have some reservations as to, that.
The introduction of the five-day forty-hour
week is a different matter altogether. In passing, may I say, I assume that the practice
which has grown up, not only in government
administrative circles but also in business
circles, of taking fiifteen or twenty minutes
off for coffee at il o'clock in the morning,
and another fifteen or twenty minutes at
3.30 in the afternoon, will stii prevail.

The dllfficulty is, and this is my main criticism, that the government, for the first time,
50 far as my knowledge goes, has put the
seal of its approval on the five-day week.
True, it will apply only in places where the
five-day week is current in other offices or
factories; but it appears to me that it will
be cited ail over the country as evidence that
the government has given the lead in acceptance of this practice and that, consequently,
it should be applied generally across the
country. My opinion is that we are now in the
five-day week era, in any event. But the
five-day week cannot apply to every class of
business or industry. For instance, how can
the great industry of agriculture enjoy a fiveday week? It cannot be done. The result
of the trend in cities to shorter hours of
work with higher pay is that the countryside
is being steadily drained of its young men,
who are attracted to places where the pay is
higher, the hours are short and the bright
lights can be found. I submit, honourable
senators, that in the long-range view of the
development of tis country this is a matter
of some importance.
Another criticism may be levelled. Much
has been said recently, and a great deal more
wlll be said, of the danger of our drifting ito
what is called a high-cost economy. It was
different during the war. One of the evils
resulting from war is the distortion in men's
minds of simple, fundamental, economic
things. During the war employment was at
its peak; we could not be busy enough and
we could not work long enough hours to
produce the essential things that the emergency demanded. After the war, some fiscal
experts who advise governments were very
badly off base. At that time we encountered
another inflationary influence, arising from
a very simple cause. During the war f armers
were unable to buy agricultural machinery,
because it was not being made; houses were
not being built; bath tubs, refrigerators and
other household appliances were very scarce;
and motor cars were not being manufactured
for ordinary civilian use. In short, the
energy of ail industry was dedicated to the
war effort. Then when hostilities ceased there
was a huge vacuum that had to be filhed with
goods of ail kinds.
That, of course, was essentially a seller's
market: The factory owner found markets
for all the goods he could produce, and he
was quite willing to give labour the best
possible terms of employment. As a resuit
labour got shorter hours, fringe benefits and
increases in wages, and the manufacturer
naturally put the extra cost onto the ýprice
of his goods. One has only to examine the
financial statements over the last nuxnber of
years to see that, notwithstanding high costs

SENATE
of production and high taxation, many companies have managed to make a consistent
average of profits. But we should be under
no delusion: all these extra costs are paid
by the consumer-by you, me and everyone
else who buys these products.
The point I am now making is that these
conditions have changed: we are no longer
in a seller's market, but are now in a buyer's
market. This truth is being forcibly brought
home to, for instance, agriculturists in western Canada, as well as to people in a great
many other industries in this country. The
factor of a high-cost economy based on high
costs of production has a vital bearing on our
present and future economy.
It is estimated that 25 per cent of Canada's production finds an outlet in export
markets. But if we are to sell our products
abroad we must be in a position to compete.
That is an elementary principle. I put it to
the house that we are only now entering
that period in the world economy. How can
Canada, the United States or Britain continue
to find export markets for their products in
the face of competition from countries like
Germany and Japan, whose labour works
sixty hours a week and, if necessary, at a
lower scale of wages than we pay? The
German workman, for instance, is not content to work only forty hours a week; as a
matter of fact, two of the strong characteristics of the German people are their thrift
and their willingness to work. They would
rather work than be idle. Indeed, I venture
to say that one would not find them leaving
their work at eleven o'clock in the morning
and four o'clock in the afternoon for coffee.
These are all factors which have a vital
bearing upon our world position today. One
of my main complaints about the bill now
before us is that the government apparently
bas put its seal of approval on the five-day
week.
Tributes have been paid to the
efficiency of the Post Office Department. My
honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) said that in his opinion the
Post Office Department was efficient. The
honourable senator from Cochrane (Hon. Mr.
Bradette) in the excellent speech he made
yesterday gave his benediction to the theory
of Post Office efficiency. I submit that there
is not a single senator or member of the
other house who knows whether the Post
Office is efficient or not. The mere fact that
you are treated with courtesy when you go
to collect your mail, or that the postman
leaves your letters at your door or in your
mailbox, is not the slightest evidence of
efficiency. In my declining years and after
somewhat extensive experience in public life,

I would offer the opinion that there is no
efficiency anywhere in government administration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Do not misunderstand
me, honourable senators. I should explain
that that statement applies to provincial as
well as to federal government administration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Now, how do you measure
efficiency in a government department? My
honourable friends who are engaged in
industrial activities, or in the legal profession
are well aware how it is measured in a
business concern. To the question, "How do
you measure efficiency in an industrial
organization?" you would answer, "By the
balance sheet".
Hon. Mr. Barbour: The surplus.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And if the efficiency of
your organization is not such that your
balance sheet measures it favourably, then,
make no mistake about it, your banker will
soon measure it for you.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: How about the legal
men?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The legal men, such as
my honourable friends from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden and Hon. Mr. Campbell) and
Vancouver South (Mr. Farris) have to be
efficient, for if they are not efficient someone
else will come along and take their legal
business.
But a similar test cannot be applied to
government departments anywhere. So to my
two colleagues who have already expressed
admiration for the Post Office Department I
submit that we do not know whether it is
efficient or not; and I will mention a few
points that lead me to suspect it is not nearly
as highly efficient as we have been led to
believe.
I repeat, we cannot measure the efficiency
of government administration by any such
rule as we can apply to business. All we
can do is pray that the ministers who are
placed in charge of departments, from whatever party they may corne, will be men of
some experience and knowledge and will
hold the lid down as tightly as they can. A
government department cannot be run otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: May I ask the honourable senator a question? If efficiency in
government cannot be measured, how can
you tell that it is not efficient?

FEBRUARY 17, 1954
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, that is a poser of
a minor kind. I suspect that it is not efficient when I have to dig a little bit deeper
into my pocket almost every year to pay taxes
to support it. I dislike anything in the
nature of a personal reference, but may I
say that I have had some experience in
business for many years, and, I may
modestly claim, with some measure of success, as my honourable friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) knows. I
have also had some experience in governN'ow, to determine
ment administration.
efficiency you cannot apply to government
administration the same tests that you apply
to business organizations. Why? Because
there are too many pressures coming in.
Governments everywhere think, and naturally and perhaps properly so, that they are
ordained to rule. Governments never want
to become unpopular, and consequently they
shrink from doing unpopular things, even
when they may be the necessary and right
things to do.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: Not this government.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My point is that you cannot measure the efficiency of a government
department by any ordinary business rule.
Last year officials of the Post Office Department apparently had a doubt in their minds
about how efficient they really were, so they
engaged some outside firm, whose name I
have forgotten, to go through the whole
department and report to them whether they
were efficient, and if not, how they could
become efficient. Well now, about the last
thing on earth to do is to bring outside
people in to do a job of that nature. If
departmental officials have the right kind of
minister and deputy minister, and if the
politicians leave them alone, they can become
efficient in a few years time; but if they are
not left alone and if they cannot become
efficient without getting some advice from
the outside, the improvements resulting from
the advice are not going to amount to much.
That is my humble view of the matter, at
any rate.
Honourable senators, let me suggest a few
matters in which improvement could be
made. In its report made two years ago the
Senate's Finance Committee recommended
that the government abolish the franking
privilege for government departments. My
honourable friend from Cochrane (Hon. Mr.
Bradette) yesterday argued against that
stand, but I think it is pretty clear that if
that were done and each department of government had to budget for its postage-that
is to say, make an estimate for postage just
as it does for salaries, fuel or anything else,

and live within their budget-we would cut
down, probably by fifty per cent, the amount
of the printed material that streams out from
the Printing Bureau in Ottawa and other
bureaux all over the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It would have a disciplinary effect upon departments. When some
department of the public service sends a letter
or document or booklet to my honourable
friend in Vancouver South and he glances at
it and says "That is no good", it goes to
the waste-paper basket. That happens, and
happens frequently. But what has been
entailed by way of expense is, first, the cost
of the printing; second, the cost of taking
the material to the post office; third, the
amount paid to the railways to haul it to
Vancouver and the handling by post office
officials there. My proposal is that the
government put into effect a rule that departments must budget for their postage; and I
suggest that would bring about an enormous
reduction both in the quantity of material
printed and the cost of handling it through
the mails. This is, I submit, one place where
the government could effect a substantial
saving.
Another activity on which I trust we shall
get some information when the bill goes to
committee, is the Post Office Savings Bank.
It is very curious-and this remark applies,
for I am speaking impersonally, to governments of all political stripes-that when
some custom or institution gets imbedded in
the governmental system of a country it is
almost impossible thereafter to get it removed.
At the time it was introduced, the Post Office
Savings Bank was probably justified. But
today any person who wishes to deposit his
savings securely has many places where he
can put it. All the cost of administering the
Post Office Savings Banks falls on the national
revenues, and therefore on the taxpayers. Is
it not worth while to consider whether the
continuance of this institution is necessary?
Another classical example of what, it seems
to me, is an unnecessary service is the
Annuities Branch, under the Department of
Labour. Since its establishment it has cost
the taxpayers of this country tens of millions
of dollars. It may have been desirable, many
years ago, when this branch was instituted,
to encourage people to buy annuities against
their old age; but long since there have been
plenty of avenues wherein an individual can
put his money to buy annuities on terms just
as favoúrable as those pertaining to government annuities.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: No. I don't think he can,
for the reason that the government pays al
the costs of administration; and I believe my
friend will find that the rates charged for
annuities by any insurance company are
higher than those charged by the government.
I admit, of course, that the amount of a government annuity is limited to $1,200, whereas
with an insurance company there is no limit.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: On that point I stand
corrected, but I want to emphasize that the
price charged for government annuities has
not been sufficient to keep the fund solvent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is true.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And we have paid into
the fund to maintain its solvency over the
last twenty-five years, tens of millions of
dollars.
Hon. Mr. Haig: $250 million.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is that policy desirable,
when plenty of opportunities are available
to buy annuities elsewhere?
These instances-and they are only a few
among those I could mention-I bring to the
attention of my honourable friend from
Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr. Barbour) as
evidence touching on the efficiency which
exists in this administration.
I thought the honourable member from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), in his
speech the other day, made a very good point
with regard to the charges for air mail. From
the data available it appears that air-mail
business comprises about 25 per cent of all
mail transported. To be frank, I believe the
air-mail business should carry itself, and it
is unsound in principle and wrong in practice
to have the "mother" of whom the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke the
other day subsidize a business firm in Winnipeg or Vancouver that wants to send air-mail
communications to offices farther east or
west. This is a matter upon which we should
get some information when the bill is in
committee. I repeat that the air-mail service
should stand on its own feet. The ordinary
user of post office facilities should not be
taxed to assist the individual who conducts
his correspondence by air.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Will my honourable
friend apply that principle to newspapers and
periodicals?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
has just anticipated my next remark.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do so because I know
the honourable gentleman so weIl.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That, I may say to the
house, is an evidence of my honourable
friend's prescience.

In speaking on the question of newspapers
I am treading the edge of a precipice, because
I see several newspapermen looking at me.
But it is not denied that newspapers are
carried below cost. I say that without at
the moment arguing whether this is justifiable or not. The other day my honourable
friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) made
a very good argument to the effect that what
is done is not a subsidy to the newspapers,
but a subsidy to the subscribers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And to the advertisers.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, I suppose it could
be considered as also a subsidy to the advertisers; because, I assume, if newspapers had
to pay a higher postage rate they would do
two things: they would increase the price to
their subscribers, which naturally they do
not want to do; and they would raise their
advertising rates, which might be a very
difficult thing to do.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: At any rate, a heavy loss
is incurred through this service by the
department. Has there been any examination to find out whether some of this cost
could be recovered? I do not know. But
questions such as these should certainly be
explored in committee.
Honourable senators have been more than
patient, and I am about to ýconclude. A few
days ago the main estimates were brought
down. They totalled almost $4J billion, but
contained no provision for old age security,
which it is estimated will amount to $355
million. If current newspaper reports are
correct, the old age security fund is at
present in debt to the treasury to the extent
of about $150 million.
When the 2-2-2
formula was put into effect it was thought
that within a year or so it would meet the
cost of providing old age security, but that
theory is proving to be wholly incorrect.
That deficit of $150 million has to be made
up somehow. Perhaps the government will
increase the old age security tax. It may
even raise the contribution of honourable
senators and other income tax payers to 3
per cent of their income. Perhaps it may be
decided to take a little more out of the sales
tax and apply it to old age security, which,
of course, would reduce the revenue from
the sales tax for ordinary purposes.
Let us look at the facts. According to the
Blue Book there is an increase of approximately $70 million in the main estimates over
last year. I would direct your attention to
the fact that defence estimates are down $92
million, and Defence Production estimates are
down $35 million.

FEBRUARY 17, 1954
Hon. Mr. Euler: But the supplementary
estimates are still to come down.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, not only the supplementaries for the next fiscal year, but before
March 31 we shall have a batch of supplementaries to take care of over-spending during the present fiscal year.
I want to
approach this subject wholly objectively. Just
look at the spending of our provincial governrments. The honourable senator from Bedf ord (Hon. Mr. Nicol) is a member of the
Quebec Legislative Council, and I hasten to
say that I have no criticism to make of that
legislature or any other. But the fact is
that all provincial government expenditures
are going up. If we take expenditures at all
levels of government in this country it will
be seen that we are spending more than onethird of our net national income in taxes. We
just shrug our shoulders and say with a smile
"What of it?" In good times, when we were
drinking the perfumed waters of inflation,
everything was going well, but that state of
affairs could not go on for ever. We are
endeavouring now to reach a stable level
somewhere, and I submit no country can take
one-third or more of its net national product
in taxes and keep going ahead. These are
facts about which we do not think, but they
are vital and important.
Honourable senators, the time has come
when we should give serious consideration to
all the fringe benefits that industry everywhere is seeking-increased wages, the fortyhour five-day week, and so on-if we are
going to have any regard for the future of
this country and for posterity.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I had not intended to take part in this
debate, for the only information I have about
the legislation is what I have read in Hansard;
but I have been prompted to rise after listening to the speech of the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). He made
many interesting comments, some dealing
with the bill itself and others dealing
with the rather broad field of government
operation, including the question whether it
is possible for governrments to operate economically. Let me say at the outset that I am
prepared to accept my friend as a quasi
expert in the field of government departmental administration. He might deny this
statement, but he was always recognized as
a capable and efficient administrator of any
government department under his charge
during his long period of public service.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is why I felt my
friend was painting with a much broader line

than he really intended when he gave utterance to the expression that there is no efficiency anywhere in government administration.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My friend is putting
words in my mouth. What I said was that
you cannot attain the same efficiency in government administration that you can in private administration.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my friend were permitted to make his speech all over again that
is the expression he would use, -and I was
going to suggest that that is the expression
he intended to use. However, I repeat that
that is not the expression he did use, for I
took down his exact words and said to myself
that there must be some qualification of his
statement. While perhaps it can be said that
government departments are not as efficient
as industries in performing certain services,
it does not necessarily follow that either group
is inefficient. To say that one is more efficient than the other is entirely different from
saying that one is inefficient. My limited
experience does not permit me to say whether
or not our Post Office service is efficient,
but I always gathered that postal service is
one service that our people demand. Despite
the cost, they want the best -and most rapid
postal delivery service available.
I want to refer to the main points made
by the honourable senator from Churchill,
and then comment briefly on his broad dissertation on the question of efficiency. The
best reason in the world I can think of for
increasing postal rates is to raise the necessary funds to pay for the service. I can see
no reason why the people of Canada should
contribute taxes for the provision of a postal
service. I think the proper basis upon
which to proceed is that those using the
service should pay for it and, therefore, if
the cost of operation justifies an increase
in rates, the increase must be put into effect.
In my own thinking I cannot justify a subsidy for postal rates at any time; I think
the service should bear its own charge.
The only question upon which there may
be some doubt is whether or not the postal
organization bas become over-built to provide
the daily delivery service-and twice-daily
delivery in sorme places-that the public are
clamouring for. To determine that question
would require a very careful and minute
examination of the organization of the Post
Office Department. With all due respect I do
not think we are at present equipped to
make such an examination, or that one is
needed, unless there should be some major
breakdown in the efficiency we see manifested from day to day in the operation of
the service.

SENATE
I am prepared to take it that the estimates
which have been made represent the amount
of money needed to give adequate postal
service to the people of Canada in the coming
year. Having accepted that proposition, I
am forced to the conclusion that if the present
service warrants an increase in rates, the
people benefiting from the service should pay
it. I see no reason for dipping into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or for taxing me,
because some person writes and mails more
letters than I do.
I am quite sure we are not going to be
priced ,out of world markets by reason of
these proposed increases in postal rates. If
we have been or are being priced out of
world markets it is because an infinite number of other things have so increased in
price that we cannot pay for them and continue to produce on a competitive basis.
Ultimately those things will take care of
themselves, because when times are good
and there is the sellers' market that my
honourable friend was talking about, goods
will sell themselves; for when people have
the money they keep on buying goods. But
there comes a day of reckoning, when the
dollars required to obtain goods or services
look so large in relation to the time and
effort necessary to earn those dollars that
people think twice about spending them;
and if that attitude on the part of the
purchasing public becomes general the country
suffers from a "buyers' strike". That is the
way any adjustment is made in our so-called
high-priced economy. It is not achieved
by any general statement that the Post Office
Department is inefficient and should not be
permitted to increase the rates.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before my honourable friend
continues, may I ask him a question? I am
perturbed about only one thing. He sai'd
that the people who benefit from the service
ought to pay for it. Am I right?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But are not the users of
first-class mail service "paying the shot" or
part of it for those who use the second-class
mail?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a matter of
policy, and if enough members of parliament think that the method of distributing
postal costs should be changed, and are
vocal enough, it will be changed.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why shift from principle
to policy?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: At the moment, what
I am discussing is the basic principle of this
bill. The Post Office Department has an
organization that costs a certain amount of

money in a year. That money must be provided. Whether within the framework of the
distribution of the costs a sufficient charge is
not made against some items and too great
a charge is made against other items is a
question of policy. I am not prepared to
engage in a discussion as to whether the cost
of mailing a newspaper should be so many
cents, and of a letter so many cents. Those
are details that can be studied if the bill
goes to committee. I am dealing with what
I consider to be the basic principle of the
bill. I say that the people who get the benefit of the service should pay for it-distribute
the costs any way you like.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend think that is the basic principle of
this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I would say it is
the basic principle of this bill, because as
I see it the cost of the service this year
against the revenues available at present
rates would produce a deficit. On that basis
more money is needed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: But you have not
examined the basis of that.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, and I do not intend
to do so on the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am not surprised.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would be surprised if
my honourable friend expected me to do so.
So far as the five-day week for postal
service employees in certain areas is concerned, if the government recognizes the fiveday week as a principle, even to a limited
extent, it is merely following a pattern that
has already been well developed in industry
and commerce.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt
my friend, but I understand that he has
laid down the principle that the people who
use the service provided by the Post Office
Department should pay for it. I am inclined to agree with him. But was it not
stated here a few days ago by the senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), that
second-class mail produces a loss of something like $15 million?
Hon. Mr. Reid: A loss of $15 million on
second-class mail alone last year
Hon. Mr. Euler: Therefore, on the basis
of the principle the senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) has laid down, the rate
for second-class mail should be increased to
take care of the deficit.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know whether
that is a statement or a question. I will
assume that it is a question.

FEBRUARY 17, 1954
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps it is both.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, I suspect it is a
statement with a question mark at the end!
I will answer my honourable friend in this
way: Suppose we start out with an estimate
of the cost of giving service this year, and
on the basis of the revenue the department
will be short so much money. That money
has to be provided. In principle, the money
should come from the people who get the
service. My honourable friend says, "Is it
not a matter of principle that you should increase the cost of second-class mail rather
than first-class mail?" I say it is a matter
of policy. My friend may agree or disagree
with me as he likes, but I say that the
principle of this bill is to provide for a
sufficient increase in the revenues of the
Post Office Department to enable it to give
the service without a deficit.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
member a question? If in a year or two
from now the Post Office Department should
have a deficit, and say, "Since we must pay
our way we are going to ask parliament to
authorize another increase of a cent or two
cents," what would my honourable friend
say to that?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not going to be
talked into discussing what might happen
in the future, because we do not now know
what the contingencies will be. Frankly, I
do not know what my position would be,
under different circumstances, next year or
the year after, but I would try to be logical
in my conclusions, based on the facts placed
before me. What I am dealing with now is
the principle of this bill on its second reading, and I do not propose to wander as far
afield as my honourable friend did in his discussion of the efficiency and inefficiency of
govermnent services.
In my opinion the working efficiency of
Canadians is not going to be unduly affected
by the five-day week. I do not think passage
of this bill will result in a tremendous and
overwhelming pressure for a five-day week
from all industry, from all who are providing
services in Canada and do not now enjoy
the five-day week.
If the government is not prepared to recognize the five-day week in those areas where
it does now exist I would expect it would
have difficulty in obtaining the necessary
staff to provide proper service. That may
be the impelling reason for recognizing the
shorter week in certain places. Nevertheless, I do not foresee the awful consequences
which it is suggested might flow from the
contemplated adoption by the Post Office

Department of the five-day week. In other
words, I do not think the government is
carrying the banner of a five-day week at the
head of the parade; rather, I think it is
toward the tail end of a procession that has
been going on for a long time.
As to the question of inefficiency raised by
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), and his suggestion that higher
taxation indicates inefficiency, in my view
that does not follow at all. I am sure that
during the period when my friend was supervising expenditures of a department under
his administration the estimates increased
year after year by reason of the necessity
for providing more in the way of staff and
services, because of the growth and expansion of the department and the services
required of it. Obviously, the only way a
government can get revenue to provide services is by taxation. The alternative, of
course, is to freeze the tax level and cut
down the expenses of administration to that
base. But I do not think that any government would subscribe to that policy, particularly for the reason that no government
can say, any more than any business can say,
we will operate on a static basis and regardless of the scope of operations and the
demands made upon us, we will spend this
much and no more.
Whether the decision to expand services
was good or bad, I am not discussing that at
the present moment; but as a general principle I say that increases in taxation
are no evidence of inefficiency in public
administration.
As an illustration of increased services, I
might mention that a few years ago we saw
fit to provide certain social security measures,
including universal old age pensions, which
I am sure my honourable friend supported.
We knew that we would have to find more
money to meet these obligations, and once
we sanctioned the legislation we had to provide means by which revenue would become
available to the government to take care of
them.
Within the past few years we have had
a large defence program by reason of the
emergency which existed, and as a result of
additional expenditures in that respect the
government had to levy increased taxation.
So long as the public are clamouring for
additional services-and they are now asking
for further unemployment benefits and hospital services-and so long as members of
parliament support those demands-and I
am not criticizing them for doing so--we must
of necessity find the money by way of taxation to meet the expenditures. If opposed

FEBRUARY 17. 1954
of ancient Rome and of the time-I think
it was in the days of Cicero-when there was
an old senator who was constantly making
speeches about the degeneracy of his times,
and how very much better things were thirty
or forty years previaus when Plancus was
consul.
The expression Consule Planco-when
Plancus was consul-camne to be used as an
epitome of the belief that the past was better
than the present. Well, now, thinking of that
aid Roman senator of 2,000 years ago, I
could not; help feeling that if my honourable
friend fromn Churchill wore a toga and had
a wreath of laurels around his brow, he
would look even more distingushed and
impressive than he does in his present attire.
I try to resist this tendency to believe that
the old days were better than the present
and I think the way to keep young, at least
mentally, is to try to keep abreast of the
modern developments we see around us.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What happened to Rome
and the Romans'? They did not accept a
warning.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think it was 500
years after the time I mentioned that Rame
fell, so there was a certain period of time
in between.
I appeal to my honourable friend fromn
Churchill, let us not become old mossbacks
tagether, but let us keep abreast of the
times.
In connection with this farty-hour, fiveday week, my suggestion to the house is this:
in essence it is a dividend which the people
of this country, along with the people of
mast of the advanced industrial countries of
the world, are-very properly-receiving
through the scientific and technological
developmcnts which have taken place in the
last twenty-five years. We have machines
now ta do the work of men. Machines are
daing ail the hard physical labour which
men used ta do, and more and mare of the
technical work which men used ta have ta
do. As a consequence, and a very natural
and logical and laudable cansequence, man
is enjaying more leisure than he ever had
before. The development of which I have
spoken is really the basic reason why we
have this five-day, forty-hour week.
Look at it fram anather and perhaps more
personal point of view. It means that very
large segments af the people af this country
are getting more leisure than they ever had
before. They have twa days a week at home
instead of one day or one and a haîf days.
For the life of me I cannot see any abjection
ta that. I think it is an admirable thing. I
have sufficient confidence in the ordinary
average Canadian-if indeed such an animal

exists-to believe that he will use wisely
the additional leisure which an extra day
at home gives him. He will spend more time
with his family, his ýchildren. He will have
more time ta do those innumerable jobs of
carpentry and painting around the house
which his wîfe has been asking him for a
long time ta do. He will spend a lot of time
gardening or digging or building a boat or
fishing or doing any one of those innumerable
things which become the hobbies of mankind, and which mankind treats as a relief
fromn the burden and the drudgery of
ordinary labour.
I have had same slight experience of the
introduction of the five-day week and its
application ta the law firms of this country
over the past two or three years. I think it
will be found that the great majarity of the
larger firms, bath in Canada and the United
States, are now clased down tight on Saturday mornings. We of the profession of the
law have received the benefit of the five-day
week-I fear, somne time after great numbers
of industrial emplayees, but we have received
it-and my experience, for what it may be
worth, is that a man works better five days
a week out of seven than he does five and a
half or six days a week out of seven. That
is my feeling about the introduction of the
five-day, farty-hour week, and that is one of
the reasons why I support this bill.
In his speech the other evening, the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said that he was opposed ta any increase of
the postal rates. I submit ta, him that that of
itself is flot a very helpful sort of statement.
If he had added that he was against any
increase of the postal rates because he did
not believe in any increase of salaries of
postal employees, or in the introduction of the
five-day, forty-hour week, that would have
been lagical enough. But he did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute. The fiveday week was not announced in the other
house until the day before yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I set forth quite
clearly in my remarks that the increased
rates were required because of the five-day
week.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Looking at this matter
in the broadest possible light, I cannot see
any injustice, nor any seriaus disadvantage,
in increasing the postal rate on letters from,
say, four tai five cents. If honaurable members will take their minds back ta the postal
rates which were in existence in this country
twenty years ago and compare them with
what they are today, they will realize that
postal rates have not increased in anything

SENATE
like the proportion or the percentage that
practically every other economic index one
can find-wages, cost of living, everything
else-has increased. My feeling is that this
proposed increase in the postal rates is fully
justified, not only for the particular reason
that it is designed to meet the additional
expenditures that have been mentioned, and
of which I cordially approve, but because
it will bring the postal rates of this country
more into line with the other classes of
expenditures which our citizens normally
have to meet.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, perhaps I may be permitted to close the
debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would draw the
attention of honourable senators to the fact
that if the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) speaks, he will
close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
in closing the debate I can make one statement with which, I think, all honourable
senators will be in accord; that is, that we
have had a very interesting and enlightening
discussion of this bill. Every speech which
has been made has given the house some
information on the question -of the administration of the Post Office Department, and
the various honourable senators who have
spoken have expressed their views on the
efficiency or otherwise of this department.
Also there has been some debate, in which
I do not intend to take part, of whether a
Opinions on
five-day week is advisable.
both sides of the question have been
expressed in the discussion this afternoon.
I was interested in hearing the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) say
that the government, by introducing a fiveday week, is giving a lead, whereas a few
minutes earlier the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) was complaining that the government was not giving
the lead in this direction in the district from
which he comes. I think it is quite clear that
the government is conforming to the five-day
week system in those communities where it
is the practice at the present time.
I am not now going into a general discussion of the whole question of government
administration-whether this or that department or branch is operating efficiently, or
whether, for instance, the Annuities Branch
of the Department of Labour is necessary.
That is not the issue. There is only one
issue before us at this time, and that is
whether the postage rate should be increased
on first-class mail. I am sure all honourable

members have come to the conclusion that
such an increase is necessary, for if it is not
put into effect the Post Office Department
will suffer a deficit of $14,500,000 this year.
The principle of the bill is that the department shall be enabled to balance its budget.
Some members think the existing deficit
should be dealt with in one way, and some
in another, and it seems to me that this whole
question should be fully discussed in committee. Surely the house wants more information before deciding whether this is the
method by which the sum of $14,500,000
should be raised.
Without any further
remarks I am going to ask that the bill be
given second reading now, and if this is done
I intend to move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, where officials of the Post Office
Department can be called to provide honourable senators with whatever information they
desire. In concluding my remarks I wish to
thank all honourable members who have
contributed to this debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Lambert, for the second reading of Bill 168,
intituled "An Act to amend the Post Office
Act".
Is it your pleasure to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I say a word at this
time? Would the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) be agreeable to arranging for a special meeting of this committee on
Tuesday morning next to decide what witnesses the committee should call? It may be
that one departmental official is better qualified than others to give information about
second-class mail, and another about the
savings bank branch, and so on. Perhaps
it will be necessary to ask the Deputy Minister of the Post Office Deparment to advise us
as to which officials we should call.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is impossible for
me to say when the departmental officials
will be available to appear before the committee. I believe it is customary for the
party whips to decide on suitable dates for
committee meetings after they have ascertained when the officials will be available. I
am sure that the whips will take notice of

Corporation of the City of Toronto is a

Any additional capital to be subscribed shal

namely, 65 per cent for Consurners' Gas Company and 35 per cent for Tennessee Gas

funds required to complete the enterprise,
it is hoped and expected, will be realized
frorn the sale of debt securities like bonds
and debentures. I arn informed that the
financial arrangements proposed are satisfactory and adequate for the purpose of the
company. This is also a matter which might
well be investigated if the bill goes to coinmittee.
There is one more point I should perhaps
mention. As honourable senators know, there
has been considerable public discussion about
a project to, bring natural gas froin western
Canada to Ontario and Quebec, and government policy has already taken fairly definite
shape on this point. It is expected that the
American gas which wouki reach Toronto
through this project would corne very much
sooner thani the Trans-Canada lune can be
completed.
The industrial and domestic
facilities required for the use of American
natural gas in the Toronto area would be
available for the natural gas from western
Canada, when it reaches Toronto, and if this
project proceeds they would be installed in
anticipation of its arrival. I arn inforrned,
moreover, that the importation of Arnerican
gas will be subject to a back-off agreement as
gas froin western Canada becomes available
and is substituted therefor in the territory
now served by Consumers' Gas Comnpany.
The terms and conditions of this back-off'
agreement again are matters which 1 think
the committee might well want to investigate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second turne.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
PRIVATE BILL
DOMINION PIRE INSURANCE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campb.fl moved the second
reading of Bil K-10, an Act respecting The
Dominion Fire Insurance Company.

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill, asking that the naine of the

company be changed from The Dominion
Fire Insurance Company to, The Dominion
Insurance Company.
The cornpany in question was formed in
1904 and has for a number of years carried
on an insurance business, principally related
to fire insurance; but i the latter years it
has written other forins of insurance, and has
now reached the stage where the majority of
its insurance in force is other than fire. It
is for that reason that the company now
desires to eliminate froin its naine the word
"fire".
I should say to, honourable senators that
since being asked to sponsor this bill I have
learned that there is some objection to the
proposed name. The representatives of certain companies feel that if the name is
changed to The Dominion Insurance Coinpany there will be a conflict with other
companies of a similar naine. I arn suggesting, therefore, that that matter be rnost caref ully investigated when the bill goes to
committee. I know that one company, The
Dominion Life Assurance Company, which
has been ini existence for a number of years,
feels that the proposed naine would conflict
with its own.
I would suggest, honourable senators, that
when this bill has received second reading
it be referred to, the Standing Comrnittee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills, where representatives o! opposing companies can appear
and state their position, and ai other interested parties, including the Departinent of
Insurance, can be represented.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
had it not been for a partial explanation of a
problein arising out of this bull by the sponsor of the bill, the senator froin Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell), I should certainhy be
obliged to take strong exception to it as it
now stands.
The applicant company, The Dominion
Fire Insurance Company, has I think been
operating pretty largely as a fire insurance
company; but apparently through the years
it has developed other hines of insurance to,
the point where it now feels that its naine
as a lire insurance company does not adequately describe its activities. With the
desire to change the naine I have no fault
to find; but when I learned two weeks ago
froin the solicitors for the company that
they propose rnerehy to drop the word "fire"
froin the naine and that it be known as The
Dominion Insurance Company, I feht I would
have to oppose the bull.
In the city o! Waterloo we have the head
office o! The Dominion Life Assurance Coinpany; and while I do not think ut is the

SENATE

intention of the company now making application to enter the life insurance field I am
certain there would be some confusion in
the mail going to the two companies: letters
intended for The Dominion Insurance Company would go to The Dominion Life Assurance Company, and vice versa. It is for that
reason and others that The Dominion Life
Assurance Company objected to the proposed
new name "The Dominion Insurance Company".
When the matter came before our Waterloo
company we made formal objection to it,
and I am quite sure that the Superintendent
of Insurance is in sympathy with the objection taken. The superintendent wrote to The
Dominion Life Assurance Company asking
their opinion with regard to the proposed
change, and the board of that company suggested an alternative name be chosen. Some
correspondence followed, and finally, I think
upon the suggestion of the superintendent, it
was proposed that the name be changed to
"The Dominion Insurance Corporation" instead of "The Dominion Insurance Company".
When that suggestion was passed on from
the General Manager of The Dominion Fire
Insurance Company to the General Manager
of The Dominion Life Assurance Company,
the board of the latter company discussed it
and felt that under the circumstances there
was sufficient difference between the names
te avoid confusion in the public mind, and
they withdrew their objection to the bill.
I fancy that the acceptance of the suggested change has not yet reached the
General Manager of the company making
application for this bill. If there is any
insistence on changing the name to that set
out in the bill, I would most certainly have
to object to its second reading; but if there
is more or less an understanding, as I think
there is, that the bill be amended in committee-and I think it should go to the Banking and Commerce Committee-to make the
proposed name "The Dominion Insurance
Corporation" instead of the "The Dominion
Insurance Company", I have no objection to
the bill being given second reading.
In conclusion I would make one other suggestion, that in future no companies of a
more or less public nature should be permitted te use the name "Dominion", because
I think there is somewhat of an assumption
by the public that when that name is usedand I am speaking now of such companies as
The Dominion Life Assurance Company, of
which I happen to be a director-the government is behind the company. I would venture
to say that if The Dominion Life Assurance
Company came to parliament today to ask
for a charter under its present name, that
name would not be approved. The same may
be said of The Dominion Bank. I think an

inference may be drawn by the general public that the government of Canada, the
Dominion of Canada, is behind that company.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is the Government
of Canada now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I know, but there are a
lot of people who still think of it as the
Dominion of Canada. I just throw out that
suggestion as an opinion of my own. There
are plenty of words in the English language,
and anyone who wishes to select a name to
describe the activities of a company certainly
ought to be able to find one that does not
contain that word "Dominion".
Hon. Mr. Davies: Where is the head office
of The Dominion Fire Insurance Company?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Toronto.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Campbell the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
EXPLOSIVES BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS-CONSIDERATION
STANDS

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the amendments made by the House of
Commons to Bill C, an Act to amend the
Explosives Act.
Hon. Mr. Lambert moved that the amend-

ments be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, I have a
marked copy of the bill showing the amendments as reported in yesterdays Minutes of
the Proceedings. I consulted the Law Clerk
of the Senate, who assured me that the
verbal changes that have been made in the
text of the bill as passed by this house in
no way alters the substance or meaning of
the bill, so I have no hesitation in moving
concurrence in the amendments.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
this bill, as I recall it, was before us last
December, and it struck me as being a very
very important bill. I recall that I made
inquiries in connection with it. The bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, at which we heard
of the department give
representatives
explanations of the reasons for the amendments. I am interested in knowing whether
the amendments made by the other place
and submitted today are of a minor nature
only. If they are not lengthy, perhaps the
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
would let us know what is their nature.

FEBRUARY 17, 1954
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Perusal of the amendments studied in their proper setting in the
text of the bill would I am sure justify my
honourable friend in supporting the proposed
changes. There is nothing material in them.
They are really just verbal changes made to
clarify the meaning of terms in the bill
which in no way affect its basic purpose.
The whole purpose of the bill in the first
place was simply to define more clearly the
meaning of such words as "factory", as
opposed to the modern application of the
term "arsenal"
in the manufacture of
explosives. The amendment in section 2 of
the bill, which enacts new section 3 of the
act, is an illustration of the minor nature of
the amendment. Sub-section (1) is amended
as follows: the word "This" is struck out and
the following is inserted in its place, "Except
as provided by the regulations, this".
There is a more extensive amendment proposed on page 2 of the bill. A new subsection is to be added to section 4 of the act.
The proposed amendment reads as follows:

is covered by the Regulations and understands their full import. I was interested in
knowing, first, under what governmental
departments explosives are transported,
whether by water, or by railways. I think
the honourable senator mentioned that this
matter is governed by regulations of the
Department of Transport. Of course, the
regulations are not covered by the bill. Then
I wanted to know, are there regulations
respecting the handling of explosives in and
out of Canadian ports?
My question is a general one, not confined
to Halifax, as the remarks of the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
might lead one to believe. I have in mind al
the Canadian ports. Then, I was wondering
what are these regulations, and to what ports
do they apply? Which department, or departments, or agencies see that these regulations
are carried out? Do these regulations apply
to both common carriers and naval craft?
That particular inquiry was very much in
the minds of people in certain ports where

SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I
would like to direct a question to the honourable leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald). According to press reports, governmental health authorities in Great Britain
intend to visit the United States to discuss
with health authorities of the United States
government the fandings in the recent officiai
report by a British medical committee
regarding the incidence of cancer of the
lung, and to try to ascertain if there is any
definite relationshjp between that disease
and smoking. My question to the leader is
this: Will this inquiry be extended to enable
the Department of Health in Canada to
participate in it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I know that our Department of Health
is giving very careful consideration to the
matter raised by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid).
Whether or Rot any arrangements have been
made for the representatives from Great
Britain to visit Canada, I do not know, but
1 can assure honourable senators that I will
make inquiry, and if I obtain any information
I will advise the house accordingly.

CANADIAN FORCES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second

reading of Bill 80, an Act respecting the
Canadian Forces.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
which is called the Canadian Forces Act,
1954, would amend five different statutes
which affect the Department of National
Defence. This measure is in the nature of
a statute law amendment act, and it is complicated mainly to the extent that there are
five statutes to be considered. The bill itself
contains nineteen sections.
A bill of this nature has precedent in this
parliament. Similar bills have been passed
every year since 1950, all of them called The
Canadian Forces Act of the appropriate year.
In 1949 parliament passed the Statute Law
Amendment (Newfoundland) Act, which was
of the same character as this bill. In 1950 an
act called An Act to mend the Statute Law
varied some seventeen statutes of the Parliament of Canada.
The procedure being adopted here has been
adopted in many of the provinces of Canada,
and I should think it would commend itself

to the house, particularly in the form in
which Bill 80 has been drawn. The statutes
which are affected by this bill are as follows:
The Defence Services Pension Act, Chapter
63 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952;
the National Defence Act, Chapter 184,
R.S.C. 1952; the Visiting Forces (North Atlantic Treaty) Act, Chapter 284, R.S.C. 1952; the
Senate and House of Commons Act, Chapter
249, R.S.C. 1952, and the Canadian Forces
Act, 1950, Chapter 2 of the Statutes of
1950-51.
Honourable senators, in the other place, on
second reading, it was thought that because
the bill contains so many varied sections no
general statement could be made but that
the matter should be considered in committee of the whole. I know that that procedure is not often adopted in the Senate,
and I think that after the general features of
the bill have been explained and second reading has been given it would be proper to
move that the bill be referred to the appropriate standing committee. I am informed
that the Banking and Commerce Committee
has considered similar bills in the past.
I come first to the sections of the bill that
deal with the Defence Services Pension Act.
Section 2 amends section 44A of that act,
for the purpose of permitting regulations
to be made so that some Air Force officers
now in the regular service can count a substantial period of full-time service which
they had in the reserves towards their pension. This provision is not retroactive but
would cover similar situations which might
arise in the future.
Under section 3, subparagraph (a) would
allow the making of regulations to increase
the pensions of former members of the regular forces who are appointed to one of the
armed services. Some of such people would
be entitled to pension based upon their previous service. The amendment now proposed
would allow the new period of service to
count towards pension as well. Subparagraph
(b) of the section would allow the making of
regulations for the payment of succession
duties on a widow's portion of a pension in
a manner that would be more equitable than
the manner which now obtains. The amendments which are proposed in this respect are
not without precedent. There is a similar
provision in the Public Service Superannuation Act.
I am informed that the subsection numbered (2) in section 3 is for the purpose of
ensuring that the same service cannot be
counted twice for a pension under different
parts of the act.
Section 4 permits servicemen who joined
the permanent forces in the post-war period

FEBRUARY 18, 1954
and who had full-time service in the reserves
-six months or more, that is to say-to
count that reserves service towards pension
at their appropriate rate of pay.
Section 5 amends section 50 of the Defence
Services Pension Act by adding subsection
(la), which makes it possible for a widow of
a pensioner who remarries and again becomes
a widow to receive a pension after the death
of her second husband. An amendment was
made to this clause in the other place, which
would prevent widows who married several
pensioners successively from receiving a pension on account of the pension rights of each
of her deceased husbands.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Subsection (2) of section 5 will permit the department to adjust
any of such cases which have arisen in the
past. Section 6 is similar to subparagraph
(b) in section 3. It is necessary for the Governor in Council to have the right to regulate
with reference to the payment of succession
duties in connection with widows' pensions
payable under part V of the act, which covers
people who joined the permanent forces after
the last war.
Section 7 amends section 68 of the act.
Under section 68 as it now stands, debit balances due a service by a retiring serviceman
can be charged against his pension while he
lives. There is no provision for charging
debit balances incurred by him against his
service estate. This section as amended will
allow the recovery of debit balances from
his service estate where he dies leaving
neither widow nor child.
I come now to the National Defence Act
and the amendments proposed thereto.
Section 8, subsection 1, permits the sale
of matériel owned by the Department of
National Defence to international welfare
organizations. I think that is a desirable provision.
Under subsection (2), rebates of
duties and taxes which are secured from the
taxing departments of government by the
Department of National Defence on supplies
bought by that department for foreign governments are to be placed in a special account
which that department would set up.
By section 9 it is provided that where a
serviceman dies out of Canada, and where
his personal estate situate out of Canada
does not exceed $10,000, such estate may be
administered pursuant to the regulations of
83280-19j

the department. It is understood that satisfactory arrangements could be made with
foreign countries to take over such estates
and distribute them in accordance with the
Canadian law.
Section 10 is a rather unusual one and may
bear a more lengthy explanation. The need
for this section arises from the fact that
there are so many Canadian servicemen serving abroad-in Germany with the NATO
forces, in the United Kingdom, in Japan, and
elsewhere. In Germany, under the law of
the Allied High Command, our servicemen
are not subject to the criminal jurisdiction
of the German courts. West Germany, however, may soon recover complete sovereignty.
In that event the German courts would have
jurisdiction if Canadian military tribunals
have not been set up by the law of Canada.
This section is designed for that purpose,
The same state of affairs applies, under
the NATO "Status of Forces" agreement, to
Canadian servicemen in France, Germany and
the United States. Under this agreement
Canada can exercise jurisdiction in respect
of certain types of offence, but at the
moment there is no adequate provision for
the exercise by Canada of this jurisdiction
in the case of non-military personnel who
happen to be with the forces. The amendment fills that gap, in a sense, and the parties
to the NATO agreement are bound to give
sympathetic consideration to a request that
the Canadian laws here proposed for application should be applied. Generally speaking,
the same provisions apply in the United
Kingdom. In Japan the matter is governed
by the situation which obtains under the
NATO agreement.
In order to secure the benefits of the agreements I have mentioned, Canada must be in
the position to exercise effective jurisdiction,
and in some cases it is most desirable that
the Canadian laws should be applied. This
section will enable the Canadian authorities
to show that there is provision in the Canadian law to handle such cases.
The first subsection of section 10 relates
to persons accompanying the Canadian forces
-- dependents, observers and the like. Subsection (7b) provides for the court which
would deal with the matters in question.
Coming to section 11: sometimes false
documents are submitted to service authorities when a man comes to enrol. An example
would be a false certificate of qualifications

SENATE

as to a trade or profession. There has been
no specific provision to cover this practice,
and section 11 is designed to fill that gap.
Section 12 has to do with conspiracy. It
is patterned on section 573 of the Criminal
Code, and, I think, requires no further comment here.
Section 13 is somewhat different. It has to
do with "parties to an offence". Although the
subject-matter is simple, an explanation
might be lengthy, and it may be that the
committee would be the more appropriate
place at which to inquire into this section.
Section 14 enables the Canadian authorities to carry out obligations with foreign
countries for the enforcement of the customs
laws of foreign countries in which Canadian
forces are serving. Where a member of the
Canadian forces has violated the customs law
of any such country the section confers the
right of seizure.
Section 15 permits the restitution of property stolen by servicemen, and is patterned
upon a similar provision of the Criminal
Code.
Section 16 would permit the dependents
of Canadian service personnel to be arrested
by Canadian authorities when an offence is
committed by such dependents in a foreign
country. In some cases the local laws apply
to such offences, but the local authorities,
under international agreement with Canada,
are not permitted to make an arrest. This
section would permit the arrest to be made
by the Canadian authorities, and the arrested
person would be handed over to the appropriate authorities.
The next section of the bill amends the
Visiting Forces (North Atlantic Treaty) Act.
Under this statute the crown in Canada may
be sued by a Canadian citizen in respect of
the negligence of a member of a visiting
force, as if that person had been a member of
the Canadian forces. The Crown Liability
Act, recently passed by parliament, extended
the liability of the crown in the right of
Canada to cover all torts committed by members of the Canadian forces. The present
amendment would give a Canadian citizen
injured by a member of a visiting force the
same right to proceed against the crown as
he has in respect of a tort committed by a
member of the Canadian forces.
Honourable senators, there is also a section
which amends the Senate and House of

Commons Act. The section is designed to
permit members of parliament to perform
their duties as a member of any of the reserve
forces without loss of sessional indemnity.
Heretofore the act covered only service with
the army.
Finally, the Canadian Forces Act of 1950
is amended. Under legislation passed in
1950, service in the special force in Korea
could not be counted towards a pension under
the Defence Services Pension Act. It is now
proposed by this amendment that, when a
member of the special force transfers or reenlists in the regular forces, the time served
in the special force could count towards a
pension under the Defence Services Pension
Act.
Honourable senators, that is the explanation of the bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the Committee's reports Nos. 294 to 305,
dealing with petitions for divorce, and moved
that the said reports be taken into consideration at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, I should
like to take advantage of this opportunity
to inform the house of the progress being

somewhat arduous duties.
To date there have been filed this session
462 petitions, the largest number on record

withdrawn, 291 have been heard and recommended and two have been rejected. Thus
the committee has taken care of, in one way
or another, 306 petitions, and 156 remain
to be heard. Some of that number will go

every member of the house. I compliment
the honourable senator who wrote it. I am

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
DIVORCE PROCEDURE
INQUIRY RE POSSIBILITY OF HANDLING
CASES BY DIFFERENT METHOD

Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
should like to ask the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
the Chairman of the Divorce Committee, if
he is satisfied with the procedure which is
being followed at the present time and if the
committee is considering making any suggestions to parliament.
When listening to the honourable senator a
minute ago, I should have liked to inquire
of him then, had it been in order for me to
do so, if the time has not come to relieve
honourable senators of the tremendous task
which he has described, and if, in the opinion
of the members of the committee, some more
practical procedure and one more in keeping
with the judicial function of the committee
should not be adopted.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I had no notice of the question, so it
comes to me fresh. I really feel that I am
not in a position to answer the question
intelligently off-hand.
The big question whether the Senate should
handle divorces is not a matter exclusively
for the Chairman of the Divorce Committee,
although naturally he is rather close to the
subject. I fancy many improvements could
be made in the present procedure. I think
that this session, by dividing up into more
committees, we have made a great improvement. The work is being done more expeditiously, more members of the committee are
taking part in the actual administration, and
the division of the work has made it possible
to handle so large a number of cases without
any appearance of hurry, yet in each case
to take all the time which seems to be
required. For the most part four committees
have been operating concurrently, but
occasionally there have only been enough
cases on the list to require the services of
three committees. We are now down to "the
bottom of the barrel". This morning only
two committees were sitting. Some cases
have been set down for Friday, and a considerable number for next Monday, but thereafter we shall not sit again for perhaps two
or even three weeks, because the cases of
nearly all petitioners ready to proceed will
have been heard. In short, we are, I believe,
functioning with great facility and efficiency.

and as I do not preside over three of the
committees, I can say this somewhat impersonally.
Other suggestions for improvement have
been made, including one relating to the
taking of evidence in foreign countries and
at places in our own country which are a long
distance from Ottawa. I think that some
satisfactory arrangement in this respect will
be worked out. Other changes will be made
as we go along. Experience is a great teacher.
From the last chairman (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
we received a solid foundation on which to
build, and I may add that he has been most
helpful, since his resignation as chairman,
in the carrying on of our work.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable senator allow me a question? Has consideration
been given to the expediency of appointing
a commissioner to take evidence throughout
the year?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, I think I can say
definitely that the committee as such has
not considered that suggestion. I can promise
my friend that I will take it up with the
committee at the very first opportunity.
PATENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill 177, an Act to amend the
Patent Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
short bill: it contains only two clauses. Its
sole purpose is to increase the statutory fees
provided under the Patent Act. The schedule
of proposed increases is contained in section 1. I think it should be explained at the
outset that these increased fees are not a
charge directly on the public, but on certain
individuals and corporations that are accustomed to transact business in the Patents
Branch, and in connection with the work
which is done there.
For some time there has been a deficit in
the operations of the Patent Office, the deficit
for the last fiscal year being approximately

$133,000. The Patent Office is used by individuals and representatives of corporations
seeking to get patents for inventions, and
I am informed that some 90 per cent of the
patents are granted to non-Canadians. This
means that we are conferring on these people
a very special privilege in relation to the
development of our country. It is only
logical, therefore, that the department should
take heed of the financial incompetence of
this branch. The bill seeks to increase certain

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators I did on the Post Office Bill. I want to make

they would not apply for them. I wish to
emphasize that last year a deficit -of $370,000
was shown on printing alone by a department which in former years made a profit.
I believe that the department should be able
to collect sufficient fees to sustain itself.
When the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) explained the bill he
mentioned that an inquiry is to be conducted
by a commission into the operation of this
act and two other acts. May I urge the honourable leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to impart to the government the
thought and the suggestion that the Senate
is asking for more work and is able to undertake it. The Right Honourable J. L. Ilsley,
who is well and favourably known and of
high repute, is to be the head of the commission referred to. In the Senate we have men
of high repute too, who would no doubt be
willing to conduct certain inquiries; but we
cannot conduct inquiries unless the government places matters before us. I repeat, quite
seriously, that I should like the honourable
leader of the Senate to take a message back
to the government and to return here with
an announcement as to why certain matters
cannot be placed before this house for investigation and report. Of course, I am aware that
any senator can introduce a motion to have
a committee of inquiry set up, but I have been
here long enough to know that without the
blessing of the government the motion will
not get very far. It is easy to level criticism
at this honourable chamber for not doing
enough work, but unless the government is
inclined to place matters before us, there is
not a great deal we can do about it, other than
protest and suggest. Similar criticism, I
realize, has been levelled against the government for many many years-against not only
the present government, but every government for many years.
I am glad this bill is going to committee, so
that my statements and figures can be easily
checked for accuracy.

In conclusion, I repeat that I am taking
exactly the same stand against this bill as I
took against the postal bill, for I believe the
departments concerned should pay their way.
Under this bill and the postal bill, a class
or group of customers are getting services far
too cheap, and at public expense.
Some hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
in my opinion, the honourable senator's
analogy between the postal bill and the bill
before us is not very well drawn. The postal
bill dealt mainly with the increasing of postage rates to the public direct. The bill before
us does no such thing, but attempts to increase
charges to professional people who are served
by the Patent Office. If those people-patent
attorneys and patent agents for individuals
and corporations-want to pass those charges
on to their clients, I suppose they will do so,
but I doubt if this would always be possible.
I submit that the increases in the main
charges listed in this bill are for the very
purpose of eliminating the deficits which
my honourable friend deplores, and which
we have all deplored in the past. I think the
bill is a laudable effort on the part of the
minister to make his department more efficient and to make it financially self-sustaining.
I believe that to be the sole purpose of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My honourable friend has
the advantage of me, because I have not the
right of reply. When the bill goes to committee
I will try to convince him of the relationship
between the postal bill and this one.

a member of the other place hie would
receive an annual retiring allowance of
$3,000 for the rernainder of bis life. As the
sessional indernnity was $4,000, and the contribution was six per cent of that amount,
it was necessary to be a member for seventeen sessions in 'order to pay in $4,000. The
amount of the indernnity has now been
increased. to $8,000, so if tb.is provision were
kept in force a member of the other place
would be called upon to contribute annually
$480. He would cease making contributions
after hie had paid in $8,000, and the amount
of his retiring allowance would then be
$6,000.
However, the members of the other place
feit that $3,000 should be the maximum
retiring allowance.
In order to put that
provision into effect it is necessary to arnend
the present act, which spreads contributions
totalling $4,000 over a period of seventeen
sessions. I sbould point out that, as the act
now stands, a member would have to make
two contributions every year in which two
sessions are held. Under that provision hie
would qualify for the full retiring allowance
after seventeen sessions, which might take
place in a rnuch shorter period than seventeen years. Bill 171, an Act to arnend the
Sonate and Htîuse of Commons Act, which
was passed this session, places the indemnity
on a yearly basis; and under the bull now
before us a person can only becorne eligible
for the full retiring allowance after being a
member of the House of Commons for seventeen years.
Honourable senators, those are the main
provisions contained in the bull which I arn
presenting to the house for second reading.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question in connection with this
bill? In rny judgrnent this legisiation, which
is new, is very timely. It is exceedingly
necessary as a means of belping to, maintain
the dignity, rights and imimunities of the
members of the House of Commons. I do not
think we should interfere with this measure
too rnuch. If the Commons think that $3,000
is enough, it is not for us to criticize their
judgment. The honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has already told us how rnucb a
member will be required ta contribute, but
I shouid Uike to know what the public contribution will be; in other words, what
amount cornes from the exchequer. I ask
that for this reason: it seems to me that if
the public contribution is not too great this
bill might be permissive so that the mernber
might contribute the full amount of his
present indemnity if he desires to do so, and
thus qualify for a retiring allowance of considerably rnore than $3,000 a year. An annual

allowance of $3,000 rnay not maintain the
standard of life a retiring member of parliarnent desires, and I do not see why hie
should flot be allowed to contribute rnore,
if he wants to do so, unless that would result
ini too heavy a burden upon the public purse.
Hou. Mr. McIntyre: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) if the six per cent contribution
by members of the other place continues
under this bill? If so, a member would pay
in more than $4,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. It is expiained in the
bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If there are other
questions, perhaps I could answer ahl of thern
in closing the debate.
Hon. John T. Haig: I think the question
put by the honourabie senator from. TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) ought to be
answered, because there has been sorne
criticisrn of the fact that the pension is a
big drain on the public purse. I think it will
be found that in order to pay a retiring
member $3,000 a substantial arnount will
have to be contributed by the public.
Seventeen years is a rnuch longer period than
the old law provided for. For example, since
1949 we have had two sessions nearly every
year. In the last parliament there were
seven sessions.
I was a member of this house when an
amendrnent to the Judges Act was passed
providing that if a judge died bis widow
would receive a certain pension. A judge
could elect to have bis widow corne under
that provision or not, but later on every
judge's widow received the allowance as of
right. I arn not seeking to have additional
funds paid out of the public purse, but I
think some consideration ought to be given
to widows of deceased members or former
members of the House of Commons. Let us
suppose that after serving in that bouse for
seventeen years a member retires, then draws
the pension for four, five, or possibly ten
years, whatever it happens to be, and thon
dies. His widow may have groat difficulty in
carrying on. I arn porsuaded that when a
man serves in oitbor the House of Commons
or the Senato, or in one of the legislatures,
hie wif e makes a groat contribution to bis
service; in fact, I think she makos a greator
contribution than any other wife in the
country. I speak frorn personal exporionce
and with a koon understanding of what I
arn saying. If I may mention my own case:
I sorvod ini the Manitoba legislature for
sixteen years. It bappenod that my borne

I was able to spend far more time at horne

SENATE
than otherwise would have been possible,
but I know that my wife had a good many
things to do that I would have done if I
had not been a member. And during my
membership of nearly nineteen years in the
Senate the obligation to my wife was even
greater, for I was able to get home perhaps
only seven days in three months, while in
the meantime my wife had the care of the
home and the bringing up of the children, and
had to do the hundred-and-one other things
that the management of a home demands.
People in my city, knowing that I am a
senator who was once a member of the other
place, think that if they want something
done in Ottawa they can enlist my services.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am quite sure that
the honourable gentleman renders even better
service now that he is a senator.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I try to. I did not
intend to single myself out especially. I
have no doubt that similar demands are
made upon all honourable senators, and that
all try to give to the public the same service
that they would like to receive themselves.
I wonder if consideration should not be
given to providing a pension for widows of
members. I speak with a good deal of
feeling when I say that the arrangement is
better in the case of judges. I have in mind
at the moment a judge who served on the
bench for five years; he died suddenly, at
the age of 50, leaving a widow and three or
four children. The children are at the most
expensive stage of life: they are going to
public school, or high school, or university.
Fortunately, their mother receives a pension
of about $4,000 a year, under the Judges
Act. I wonder if we ought not to ask the
other place to consider a similar plan. I
think it is well worth consideration. The
former member for Souris, in my province of
Manitoba, served in the House of Commons
for seventeen years. He happened to be reelected to the legislature, but that did not
affect the pension he received. I mention
him, because I know that his wife made a
tremendous contribution to the province of
Manitoba by taking care of their family,
looking after the farm and carrying on for
her husband while he was at Ottawa, serving
his constituency. Yet, if he were to die
suddenly, she would receive nothing from the
parliamentary retiring allowance.
Honourable senators, I am going to support
the bill, but I would like it to go to committee,
where we can get information on the questions raised here.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
concur in the moving remarks expressed by

the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) with respect to the contribution
made by our life-partners toward the service
we render to the public in the discharge of
our onerous parliamentary duties. I often
wonder why the discussion of sessional indemnities and of pensions always seems to embarrass so many members of parliament. Why
should members be reluctant to express a
candid opinion and to discuss this subject
openly and frankly? If I am not infringing on
the rules of this house, I should like to congratulate the Minister of Finance upon the
quite free and effective statement he made a
few days ago in another place.
As far as I was able to ascertain, the people
of the city and district of Montreal have
almost unanimously approved the increased
indemnity and salaries. Upon consulting a
few members of the Senate and of the House
of Commons I find that the reaction of public
opinion varies from place to place in Canada;
but, on the whole, it is quite favourable to
the legislation already enacted and the bill
now before us.
In my opinion adequate indemnity should
at all times be provided for the services
rendered by members of both houses. After
all, senators and members, when sitting in
parliament, are removed from their ordinary
professional or business activities; they give
their time to the public, and that entails great
inconvenience and substantial expenseindeed, to such an extent that some soon find
it impossible to continue to support their
family without running into debt; others are
forced to quit public life and return to their
business: and parliament, being deprived of
their talent and experience, is so much the
poorer.
I also agree with the honourable Leader of
the Opposition that widows of members of
parliament should receive a pension, under
certain terms and conditions.
In England legislation intended to increase
the parliamentary indemnity was much less
kindly received than was similar legislation
here. Public opinion on this side of the Atlantic is of a different frame of mind. In the
United States, for instance, it is now proposed
that the indemnity of each member of both
houses of Congress be increased from $15,000

to $25,000 or more.

In this bill, dealing with the superannuation of Canadian members of parliament, we
are not changing the fundamental principle
adopted a few years ago when, after a good
deal of study, a pension plan was established
on an actuarial basis, a plan under which
the government contributes to the fund dollar for dollar with the members. A member's

FEBRUARY 24, 1954
total contribution is limited to $4,000. This
amending bill has been rendered necessary
because the amount of the sessional indemnity
has been increased from $4,000 to $8,000. So
as not to disturb the actuarial basis of the
plan, the pension remains at $3,000, the contribution of the member continues to be six
per cent of $4,000 for seventeen consecutive
years, and the government will continue to
contribute a similar amount; in that way, the
fund will take care of itself.
Many believe that, considering the increase
in indemnity to $8,000, the pension plan,
which is a voluntary one, should have provided for a pension of $6,000. If that were
done members would be required to contribute a larger amount so as to keep the
plan on an actuarial basis. In my humble
opinion, that would have been the wiser
course to follow. A pension of $3,000, subject
to income tax, is wholly inadequate to support a retired member of parliament and
his dependents. Members of parliament,
being now entitled to an indemnity of $8,000,
should be pensionable on that basis.
I am also in favour of a plan under which
widows of members should be pensioned.
But that is a matter that must first be introduced in the other place, as it would entail
expenditure of public money. We are not
competent to do more than recommend
expenditure of public money for pensions
to widows of members. In principle, in my
opinion, the pensions of members of parliament should be on the basis of the full
indemnity of $8,000, and an adequate pension
should be provided for the widows of such
members as shall have complied with the
requirements of the pension plan.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Could we not suggest
properly and within our constitutional rights
that contributions to the pension fund made
by members be permissive up to a contribution based on $8,000, without interfering
with the amount which the public treasury
contributes towards it? Restrictions placed
upon this house so far as money bills are
concerned are based on the fact that money
bills affect the public treasury. If we were
simply to suggest that members should be
allowed to contribute the full amount of six
per cent on $8,000, we would not be interfering, would we?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I would agree with the
principle. Under the act which this bill purports to amend, members of parliament are
not obliged to take advantage of the plan.
They may elect to participate in the fund,
but that is not compulsory.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) also mentioned, by way of

illustration, pensions to judges and to widows
of judges. Pensions payable to judges are
not on an actuarial basis, and there is no
pension fund in their case; the pensions are
paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
under provisions of the law. Pensions to
widows of judges do not entail an additional
charge on the treasury. To enable his widow
to participate, a judge must, during the first
six months after his appointment elect to
give a pension benefit to his wife; and, if he
so elects, his own pension is reduced by onethird. When judges' salaries were $9,000 a
year, the pension payable to a judge was
$6,000 annually. If he elects to have his wife
come under the pension scheme he will
receive, upon retirement, $4,000 a year, and
if he predeceases his wife she will receive
$2,000 a year during her lifetime. That has
given rise to numerous anomalies. By way
of illustration: if a judge elects to bring his
wife under the pension scheme, he loses onethird of his pension, and if she predeceases
him the judge continues to be deprived of
one-third of his pension, although his wife
would have drawn no benefit. That anomaly
should be corrected in the act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You say that is the present
law?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I think it is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was changed, was it
not?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not aware of it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The judge had to
make an election.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When first appointed to the
Bench.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: On a point of order: May
I ask if this part of the debate relating to
payment of pensions to widows of members
of parliament is within the ambit of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Vien: On the point of order:
This bill, dealing with pensions to members
of parliament is now before the Senate for
its concurrence. We have been discussing
the desirability of paying a pension to widows
of members of parliament, and a parallel has
been drawn between the payment of pensions
to widows of members and the payment of
pensions to widows of judges. I respectfully
submit that that is in order, under the rules
of this house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, let
me say at once that my lack of knowledge of
this question is almost abysmal. There is
some information-

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my colleague speaking
to the point of order?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Mr. Speaker, I am in a
dilemma. My colleague reminds me that a
point of order has been raised, and he asks
me whether I am speaking to it. I may say,
Sir, that I am not.
The Hon. the Speaker: Perhaps before the
honourable gentleman continues, I ought to
deal with the point of order raised by the
honourable senator from Brockville (Hon.
Mr. Hardy) as to the nature of the discussion.
I am sure that in this chamber for some
time past honourable senators have realized
that the discussion on second readings has
often gone far afield, particularly when it has
taken the form of question and answer. I
think it is probably the result of the practice
generally adopted in this house of referring
legislation to the appropriate standing committee instead of considering it in committee
of the whole. Thus, honourable senators
who are not members of the committee to
which the legislation will be referred must
get the information they require during the
debate on second reading.
As to the present discussion, if it continues in the forrn of questions and answers
I think it is pertinent to the general principle
of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My observationsHon. Mr. Haig: Now, you are in order.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My observations, I trust,
will be wholly in order. They have to do
with the manner in which this fund was
created and out of which pensions will ultimately be paid. Obviously the contribution
made by the individual member of the other
place is of itself not sufficient to meet the
cost when pension payments come to be
made. My recollection is that the Treasury
contributes to the fund on a dollar-for-dollar
basis.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But I doubt whether
even with this aid, the fund will be adequate
to the demands made upon it for pension
purposes.
Let me make clear that this is not an
argument against the principle of pensions,
but it is a suggestion that, when the bill
goes to committee, we should examine that
aspect of it. For I am reminded by
experience that, in matters of this kind, governments have often found themselves in
more or less of a quandary. As an illustration, take the Civil Service Superannuation
Fund. It was started many years ago. Contributions to it were made by civil servants

and by the government, and it was anticipated that with these resources the fund
would be in a position to provide for civil
service pensions when they fell due. But
in fact that has not been the case. For the
past two or three years, at any rate, parliament has been voting large sums of money
to put the fund on a basis of solvency. So
let us go into this thing with our eyes open,
and with the facts before us. I repeat that
what I have said is not to be understood
as in any sense a criticism of the principle
of pensions, for which, I think, there is
much to be said.
The point raised by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is not, I
submit, of so much concern to this house.
How members of the Commons wish to have
their pensions paid is, I think, largely their
affair. If a member of the other house
desires that after his death a proportion of
his pension should be paid to his widow, I
think he should have that option, as judges
have a similar option today. But if he
elected to take advantage of it be would not
be permitted, if I understand the matter
aright, to draw a pension in the full amount
of $3,000. He could elect to take part of it
and, in the event of his death, have the
remainder paid to his widow.
That is all I wish to contribute to this
discussion at present.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: May I remind honourable senators that if the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) speaks now, he will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think we are going
far beyond the provisions of this bill. The
bill merely provides that the amount of the
retiring allowance which was authorized by
the act of 1952 shall remain the sarne.
The honourable member from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has suggested that we
should inquire into the soundness of the
fund. There is no reference in this bill to
the amount which the government will pay
in. It was agreed by both houses of parliament two years ago that the government
would contribute dollar for dollar with members of the House of Commons. There is no
change in that respect, and the matter is not
before this house for consideration: it has
nothing to do with this bill.
To the question raised by the honourable
senator from Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr.
McIntyre), whether the contribution will
remain at six per cent, the answer is that it
will continue to be six per cent only to the

FEBRUARY 24, 1954
extent of the first $4,000 of the indenity.
So no change has been made ini the contribution of the member, for, as I said before, ini
the amount provided by the government.
The honourable senator frorn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and ail other
honourable senators who have spoken have
referred to a lack of provision for widows
of pensioned members. I submit that that
is sornething wbich could only be considered
at this time if it had been raised in the other
place and deait with ini this bill. But it is
not in the bill.
I think that honourable members of the
other bouse will appreciate the remarks
which have been made here today. Ail of
us agree, I amn sure, with what has been said
regarding the great contribution which oui
wives make to the service we are able to
render to the people; and I arn sure that it
will also be noted in the other place. If I
correctly interpret the feeling of this bouse,
it is that, should the House of Commons make
provision for the widows of members, not
only would it meet no opposition in this
chamber, but it would be gladly welcomed.
I do not know that there is anything I can
add. Perhaps, in view of references which
have been made to the expense involved,
honouiable members may be interested to
know that although the last election resulted
in a change of approximately seventy members in the personnel of the House of Commons, only sixteen of those who did not
return are eligibie for pension. Five of thern
are of the age of seventy or over. Those who
receive the retirement allowance do not get
the old age security pension. So it cannot be
said that this provision is costing the people
of Canada an enormous sum of money, as
money is regarded in this year of grace 1954.
If honourable senators want to have this
bill go to a committee, I have no objection,
but I repeat that the bull merely confirms the
provisions of the present act, whereby members of the House of Commons wiil pay into
the retiring fund $240 a year for seventeen
years. I commend the bull to the honourable
members of this bouse.
Somne Hon. Senalors: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Can the hunourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) inform the
house whether the fund, on its present basis
of contributions, is able to support the pensions that are now being paid out of it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is impossible for
me to give a definite answer to that question, but I would think that the fund is able
to support the present drawings of ïinly sixteen members.

The motion was agreed to, and the bull
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shaîl this bull be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Golding: Now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have no desire to
deiay passage of the bill, but I think some
useful purpose might be served by referring
it to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. The discussion which bas
taken place this afternoon bas served to
illustrate just how much the bil contains
that is of interest to ail members of
parliament.
Han. Mr. Macdonald: If it is the wish of
honourable senators that the bill be referred
to the Standing Cxummittee on Banking and
CommerceSome Hon. Senators: No, no.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shahl this bul be read the third
time?
Some Hon. Senators: Now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I could not move
that it be now read a third time without
having the unanimous consent of the house.
If it is the feeling -of honouiabhe members
that the bill shouhd not be referred to committee, I would move that it be read a third
time at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I tbink the bill should
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If any honourable
senator feels strongly that the bull should be
referred to committee, I do not think the
bouse should resist. I move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Comnmittee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 251, an Act to implement the
International Convention for the Northwest
Athantic Fisheries.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bil is to give the government statutory authority to carry out the ubligations
assumed by Canada under the International

SENATE
Convention for the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries signed in Washington on February 8, 1949, and ratified on July 3, 1950,
following approval by parliament on joint
resolution of the two houses.
Honourable senators can feel very proud
of Canada's position as a world leader in the
matter of conserving and preserving off-shore
fisheries. Canada is now a member of a
series of international fisheries conventions,
four of which are the Halibut Convention of
1923, the Fur Seal Convention between the
United States and Canada, the International
Pacifie Sockeye Salmon Convention, and the
North Pacifie Fisheries Convention which
was signed last year between Canada, Japan
and the United States.
One might ask why there has been such a
delay in giving the government authority to
carry out the obligations assumed by Canada
under the International Convention for the
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, which was ratified four years ago. There is a very simple
explanation for the delay. Some countries
which signed the agreement have not had
nearly as much experience in international
fisheries matters as Canada, and it bas taken
all this time for them to become acquainted
with the regulations embodied in the agreement and to be assured that their interests
will be protected.
The northwest Atlantic is the area to which
this convention applies, and the principal
fishery in this area is on the Grand Banks,
off Newfoundland. It should be pointed out
that although the Grand Banks have been
fished off since Sir John Cabot went there, in
1497, some 456 years ago, they still are one of
the world's greatest fishing grounds. However, this international agreement has been
entered into because intensive fishing has
depleted certain species of fish on the Grand
Banks.
There are ten contracting nations to this
convention: Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. The
convention has set up an administrative
organization under the chairmanship of Dr.
Stewart Bates, Canada's very able Deputy
Minister of Fisheries. Dr. Bates was honoured
this year by being made the first chairman
also of the North Pacifie Fisheries Commission. I think it is fair to say that it was due
to the generous offer of the Government of
Nova Scotia and the Governors of Dalhousie
University, that the permanent headquarters
of the Northwest Atlantic Commission is to
be located on the university campus at Halifax. This means that the headquarters of
three international fisheries commissions will

be located in Canada: the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries at Halifax, the International Pacifie
Sockeye Salmon Fisheries Commission at
New Westminster, and the North Pacifie
Fisheries Commission at the University of
British Columbia. The latter headquarters
have so far been established on only a temporary basis.
The International Commission for the
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries has drafted regulations to enforce conservation measures, and
the bill before us requests the legal power
to enforce these regulations on Canadian
fishermen.
Honourable senators, that in brief is an
explanation of the bill before the house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave, next
sitting.
SALARIES BILL
ORDER FOR SECOND READING STANDS
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 172, intituled: "An Act

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am informed that copies of this bill have
just arrived in this house and have not yet
been circulated.
I have in mind also that the Banking and
Commerce committee is in session at the
present time, considering an Act respecting
the Canadian Forces and also an Act to amend
the Patent Act. I believe certain honourable
senators would like to attend the meeting.
I move, therefore, that this order stand.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Are the bills being discussed by the Banking and Commerce meeting now? I understand that the committee
is to meet when the Senate rises.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) is right. Perhaps the chairman of
the committee is waiting for a quorum.
The order stands.

LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT
REPORT OF CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have the honour to present a report
of the Civil Service Commission of Canada
respecting a revision in salary ranges for certain members of the staff of the Library of
Parliament.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I would moveHon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
it was only within the last fifteen minutes
that the contents of this report were made
known to me, so I have had no time to study
it at all. I suggest, therefore, that the report
be allowed to stand over till the next sitting
of the house.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before this report is allowed to
stand, I would like to explain that adoption
of this report will give to the staff of the
parliamentary library the same percentage
of increase in salaries as was given to other
civil servants earlier in the year. As honourable senators realize, we are now near the
end of the month of February and salary
cheques for the last two weeks of February
will be issued to civil servants on Friday or
Saturday. After today this house will not
be meeting again until next week-that is,
at the beginning of March-and if the
increases are not authorized before then they
could not be included in salary cheques until
the middle of March. If this report recommended for employees of the library salary
increases different from those given to other
civil servants, we might be justified in holding it over. But, as I say, it does nothing of
the kind.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, my
position is simply this. I have never heard
this matter discussed, aye or no, in any way
at all. True, we have had increases in our
indemnities, but that matter had been discussed up and down in the other house for
days on end, and when it came to this house

I understood the problem involved. I do not
know the problem involved in the matter
before us now. As Leader of the Opposition
I have a duty to perform. I may be the
leader of only five or six members, but my
duty is to see that no legislation is put
through here hastily unless I fully understand it. I cannot be overridden on this point,
for a motion to adopt the report at this
sitting requires unanimous consent. Surely
if any member of the opposition does not
know what is in a report it is his duty to
the people of Canada, in general, and to
this house, in particular, to urge that the
report be allowed to stand over, to give him
an opportunity to study it. I know that certain increases were given to civil servants
in December and I agreed with them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At that time these
particular civil servants were left out.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And no doubt I shall agree
with the proposed increases for these
employees. They are not going to lose any
money through our letting this report stand
over. They will get their regular salary
cheques at the end of this month, but the
increase will come later. I do not believe
that the civil servants involved are in such
a position that it will do them any particular
harm if they do not get the increase until
the middle of March.
I repeat that it is my duty to insist that
the house shall have a proper chance to
understand this report before it goes through.
I do not object to the fact that, on many
issues, the majority override me. But I must
make a stand when I think my duty is clear,
although I would like to oblige the leader
of the government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not to oblige
me, it is to oblige civil servants.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know. I have a great
respect for the Civil Service, but I have a
greater respect for the taxpayers of Canada;
and I say again that we must know what it
is intended to do before it is done. So I must
refuse my consent. Otherwise I would not
be discharging my duty.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If I may be allowed one
word, I would say that I look at this matter
from a different point of view. According to
my information, some ordinary messengers
around this building are getting more pay
than men with technical experience and
ability employed in the library.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: I think that, on
general principles, the position taken by the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) is sound. But in the particular
instance before us, if any fault at all attaches

to the Post Office Department. As I have
said, excise stamps and not postage stamps
were supposed to be placed on cheques, with
the revenue being allocated to the Department of National Revenue; but the habit of
using postage stamps instead of excise stamps
was allowed to continue.
As to the wage increases, I have no
criticism on that issue. I never thought the
Post Office Department employees got too
much money, and even with their increases
they will not be paid too much.
There is a good deal of dispute about the
five-day week. We ought to face the fact
that a five-day week is not being introduced
into this country by legislation. Neither the
House of Commons nor the Senate has passed
legislation for a five-day week. It has been
adopted as a policy in the case of the Post
Office Department. Whenever the question
of wages arises in parliament, the fact will
have to be met that the government has
given recognition to and approved the fiveday week. The labourer is worthy of his
hire, there is no question about that. But the
competition for world markets has to be
considered. The other day the Right Honourable Minister of Trade and Commerce replied
to the requests of a delegation in this manner,
"How can wages be paid, let alone be increased, when the product manufactured is
being priced out of world markets?"
Germany is really determined to sell goods
in world markets, and Japan is showing
an equal initiative.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Jones) that legislation for
a five-day week has never been passed by
either the elected representatives of the
people in the House of Commons, or by the
appointed representatives of the people in
the Senate. I say that is not proper. If the
government, or any other body wants
approval given to the five-day week, legislation should be passed to make it standard
throughout Canada. Of course, I do not
think farmers could possibly adopt the fiveday week: they would have to work Saturdays, and Sundays as well, to get their
crops planted and harvested.
Honourable senators, I have enumerated
what I understand to be the three causes
of increased costs in operations of the Post
Office Department.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The rural mail
carriers also were given an increase.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As I have said, I do not
object to the salary increases.
The Deputy Postmaster General furnished
us with those three items in committee this
morning.
Then I asked him a certain

question, and he did me the compliment of
saying, "I expected you to ask me that
question."
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think he said he hoped
you would not ask it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, he said first, "I
expected you to ask me the question; I was
waiting for you." What I asked him was
this: "Outside of the items I have mentioned,
how is the Post Office Department's deficit
Is it through the handling of
incurred?
first-class mail, the handling of second-class
mail, or the handling of some subsidiary
matters?
I will deal with the subsidiary matters first,
because they are quite small. The Post
Office Department sustains a loss of $2 million
a year on registered mail. It costs the public
20 cents to register a letter, but the handling
cost to the Post Office is 35 cents. Although
I do not pretend to be the greatest business
man in this chamber, I know a little about
business and something about law. In my
law office in Winnipeg, and of course in other
law offices too, it is a common practice to
send out certain notices by registered mail,
and that is equivalent to personal service of
these notices. To send a notice by registered
mail costs 20 cents, but if the party were
served personally by a bailiff the cost would
be $4 or $5, or if the personal service was
by a member of my staff it would cost $1.50.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: How much do you
charge the client?
Hon. Mr. Haig: According to what we
Personal service costs the client
spend.
money, and I object to imposing any avoidable charges upon him. I do not like saying
to a client, "We have to charge you $1.50
for service". The point I want to make is
that registered mail is of benefit to the
people. I know it is of great benefit to the
legal profession. Men write to my office by
unregistered letter about their standing in
the military service, and enclose papers of
value. When the charge for registration was
10 cents my office used to return those documents to them by registered mail, but since
the rate has increased to 20 cents we have
stopped using that service.
The argument is advanced that if the
registration fee is increased to 35 cents there
will be fewer users of registered mail. That
may be true in small businesses. The only
way the Post Office Department would be
affected is that fewer people would have to
be employed on registered mail. That does
not mean that some employees would be
discharged, because the introduction of the
five-day week will make more employees
necessary, and it would only be necessary to

FEBRUARY 25, 1954
transfer any employee or employees from
the registered mail department to some other
department. In the Winnipeg Post Office
a clerk who handles registered mail does a
number of other jobs as well. Registrations
are just part of the general work of the
office.
I wish to emphasize that the real cause
of the deficit is not the $2 million lost on
registered mail, nor the $6 million loss
incurred by the removal of the cheque stamp
tax, nor the increase in wages, which in his
report the Deputy Postmaster General stated
was $5 million, but which he told us this
morning would probably amount to $8 million. The big loss is on periodicals, a classification which includes all newspapers. The
Deputy Postmaster General told us this
morning that he estimated this loss at $15
million. Why should no increase be applied
to periodicals? I hold no brief for the newspapers of Canada; they abuse me like a
pickpocket, as they have abused all other
honourable senators right along. I say, "Go
to it all you can". I do not think anybody
is getting greater service for nothing than
the publishers of the periodicals of this country are receiving from the Post Office
Department. That service has created a loss
of $15 million on the department's operations,
yet no increased rate is provided for in this
measure.
I think that is deserving of
consideration.
The majority may vote for this bill, I do
not recall that we have ever before had a
chance in this house-at least since I have
entered it-to show the people of this country that we think the postage on first-class
mail, which yields a profit now, should not
be increased. The Deputy Postmaster General
told me in committee that out of every dollar of the department's revenue approximately 46 cents was derived from first-class
mail, and out of every dollar of expenditure
29 cents was attributable to first-class mail.
On the other two classes, namely, registered
mail and second-class mail, there was a loss
of $17 million.
Honourable senators, that is the issue. I
am positive that more people in Canada are
disturbed over this proposed legislation than
over any other legislation that has come
before this house since I have been a member
of it. As I said in my earlier speech on this
question, the increase in rates strikes at a
very vital means of communication-the
private letter from person to person, which
is a sacred thing.
Some newspapermen tell me that if they
did not have a favourable postage rate on
their papers they could not send them out.

I am further told that 85 per cent of newspaper distribution is by mail. This I simply
do not believe. I think more people read
city dailies than read any other papers. But
whether that is true or not, why should the
person who writes a letter-the mother who
writes to ber son, or the husband who writes
to his wife-have to make up the $15 million
loss just to help out some commercial
enterprises?
Some people may argue that the five-day
week for postmen, the discontinuance of
stamps on cheques and the increase in pay
of postal employees justify an adjustment in
rates. But beyond those questions, I do not
think there can be any dispute. The fact
is that the handling of second-class mail has
resulted in a loss of $15 million, and it is
now proposed that letter writers be asked to
pay it. That point may have been raised in
another place, but I am not aware of it;
nor did any newspaper that I have seen make
mention of it.
I have nothing personal against the newspaper business, but I would point out that the
newspaper proprietors have increased their
wealth over the last ten years at a greater
rate than has any other class of people in
our communities. The value of their businesses has gone up over the past ten years at
a tremendous rate. They are doing a huge
amount of advertising, compared with that
of ten or fifteen years ago, and they scarcely
know what to do with their money. Newspaper owners may say that it is the rural
paper that is not paying its way in the mails.
Well, I have not seen all the rural papers,
but in my opinion those I have seen are for
tbe most part gossip sheets. They contain
chiefly items such as this: Mrs. Jones has
gone away; Mrs. Smith is out of town, or
somebody is visiting somebody else. The
people are entitled to get that kind of news,
but they should not get it at the expense
of letter writers.
For those reasons, honourable senators, I
object to this bill being passed. I protest
against one class of the community being
charged postage for services extended to
another class. The honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)-I am sorry he
is not in his seat at the moment-said earlier
that the principle of the bill is to provide
enough revenue to make good the loss. Certainly, that is its purpose. But what would
a business man do if he found one department
in his organization was not carrying itself?
He would either get rid of it or make it pay its
own way. For those reasons I am against the
passage of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Unfortunately, I was not

SENATE
in conmittee this morning when this measure
was considered, and I should like to know
what reason was given for not increasing the
rate on second-class mail.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No reason was given.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Certainly a reason was
given: That the smaller papers would go out
of business.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The smaller papers
would be put out of business.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not consider that a
reason. Why should the letter writers pay
a higher rate of postage to keep the smaller
papers in business? If, for instance, my law
office is not a paying business, nobody is
going to subsidize me to keep it going; and
I do not hear of anybody being asked to help
the grocer who cannot pay his bills. If it is
the case that the small weekly newspapers
require to be subsidized, why doesn't the
government subsidize them directly? In that
way we would face the question squarely. I
repeat, why should letter writers be asked
to subsidize the small newspaper business?
Hon. William A. Buchanan: Honourable
senators, I hesitate to participate in this discussion, because it might appear that I had a
personal interest in the subject. But I should
like to mention my own experience as a
newspaper publisher.
Only a very small percentage of the copies
of my paper are sent to subscribers through
the mail, and if there was an increase in
that class of postage it would affect only a
small proportion of the circulation. As was
mentioned by one honourable senator in the
earlier discussion, for that proportion of the
circulation on which any increased postage
was imposed, the increase could be added to
the subscription rate.
I should like to remove from the minds of
honourable senators the idea that as far as
daily newspapers are concerned-and I would
include the metropolitan newspapers in that
class-only a small proportion of their circulation goes through the mail. The larger
amount is distributed by newsboys, not only
in the city where the newspaper is published
but in the territory served by it. Even in the
smallest hamlet in the area tributary to the
newspaper I publish, the copies are distributed
to subscribers by newsboys. How do the
papers get to the newsboys? Usually by
truck, express service or trains-not through
the post office at alh. It may be, of course,
that other newspaper publishers in my category have not found conditions as I find
them.
On the question of subsidies, some mention
should be made of the monthly periodicals
about which representations in regard to the

postal rate are continually being made. The
companies concerned have argued that the
higher rates go, the higher their subscriptions
will be, and they have to compete with widely
circulated publications from another country
which come by express to the dealers in
towns and cities.
I am not putting up a special plea for anybody. I am simply pointing out that in my
experience only a limited portion of the
newspaper circulation goes through the mails;
and if the postal rates were increased it
would not mean as much as some honourable
senators may think by way of revenue to the
department.
I emphasize, honourable senators, that I
speak only for myself as an individual publisher.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, as
one senator who took a stand along almost the
same line as that taken by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I should like to
say to the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) and to the Senate generally
that there was not sufficient time while in
committee to get all the information one
would have liked on this exhaustive question
of the cost of handling second-class mail.
For instance, we received no answer as to
why newspapers published in cities of not
more than 10,000 population are distributed
within a radius of forty miles free of charge.
As was pointed out by the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), a
large proportion of newspapers come to
readers by way of news carriers.
In my opinion, we are not facing the facts
of this case at all. Certainly the government
is not facing them in asking one class of
people to help pay for something that should
be paid for by another class. I strongly suggest that we delay the return of this bill to
the House of Commons and investigate the
whole postal system to find out exactly where
the loss of $15 million is suffered. We should
know whether the loss is in respect to magazines, newspapers or other types of mail.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
rise more particularly to direct my remarks
to the statement made by the member
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I was
the Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications,
which had this bill before it this morning
for consideration, and I do not accept his
statement that full opportunity was not given
to every senator there to ask any questions
he wished. In fact, the greater part of the
morning was taken up with this bill. I should
not like to think anyone felt that every
facility was not given to al senators present

SENATE
The honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) complains that although
there is a five-day week generally in his
district, it has not been put into effect by
the post office there. Another honourable
senator pointed out in committee that the
five-day week has not been put into effect
in his district generally, but that the postal
employees there have a five-day week. The
Deputy Postmaster General stated this morning that if mistakes have been made the
department would try to adjust them.
The question of the loss incurred in
handling registered mail was inquired into
this morning, after the matter was brought
up by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig). The Deputy Postmaster General
said that, provided the volume of registered
mail remained as at present, the service
could be made self-sustaining if the fee were
raised to thirty-five cents from the present
fee of twenty ýcents. But be felt that if the
fee were so increased there would follow
such a reduced volume of registered mail
that the loss would greatly increase. The
department considers that at a fee of twenty
cents it is getting a volume of mail on which
the loss is as small as possible.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) suggests-I think this is the only conclusion we can come to from his remarksthat registration of mail should be done
away with. Now, I do not think the people
in this country are prepared to do away with
the privilege or the right of registering their
mail. I think that would be a mistake, and
not practical. We must retain the right to
register mail. If it cannot be done at a profit,
we should keep the loss as small as possible.
The other matter which has been brought
up is the cost of carrying newspapers. The
honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) has pointed out that the big
city dailies spend little money on postage,
since most of them make deliveries by other
means than the mails. It is the small dailies
that use the mails.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The small weeklies.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The small weeklies.
I do not know if I was correct in saying
that the dailies in small communities go
through the mails, but I think some of them
do. However, the great bulk of this business
is derived from the rural papers. I was
astonished to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) say that the small rural
papers are largely gossip sheets. Some of
those I have read are far from being gossip
sheets. The men and women who edit these
papers give considerable time and thought
to the articles which appear in them, and

I do not think these papers should be
destroyed through any act of ours. This
morning, speaking in committee, the Deputy
Postmaster General stated-and I think it
has been confirmed by speakers this afternoon-that if these local papers are required
to pay postage, practically all of them will
go out of business. That may be so, although
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) and the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) rather doubted it.
The honourable member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has made what to
my mind is a very good suggestion, namely,
that the whole question of where losses
originate should receive further consideration.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It should be gone into fully.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes: be proposes, I
understand, that the inquiry should be
undertaken by a committee, either of this
house alone, or of members of both houses.
Having listened to the arguments today, I
agree that the matter should be looked into
a little more fully. I feel that we should not,
at least at this stage, risk the possibility of
putting these small rural "locals" out of
business. My recommendation is that the bill,
in the form in which it is presented, and as
approved by the committee, be now passed
and if it is felt that further inquiry is desirable, let us have it. But I repeat, we should
not, without further investigation, take action
which will put these small papers out of
circulation. I ask honourable senators to
support the bill; and we will not let the
whole subject drop there.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In my opinion, the loss
referred to is occasioned, not so much by the
carriage of the smaller newspapers as by the
transport of other periodicals and publications which come under the designation of
second-class mail. That is where the remedy
should be looked for.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said
that I favour the abolition of registration of
mail.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understood the honourable gentleman to suggest that registration should be done away with.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. What I said was that
the fees for registration should pay the cost
of the registered mail service. That is all.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would make
the cost so prohibitive that, for all practical
purposes, it would be impossible.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let us try it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is another matter
which a committee could consider.

FEBRUARY 25, 1954
Hon. J. Gray Turgeon: I should like to say
a word or two, and I am anxious to do it
before the honourable senator for Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) rises to speak-as I hope
and believe he will.
I am in entire agreement with the excellent argument made by the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), to the
effect that this proposed legislation be adopted, and that a study be made of the various
causes of the losses sustained by the department, and what might be done to remedy
these conditions. My suggestion is that the
Committee on Finance, which under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Churchill bas done exceptionally fine work
these last few years, should inquire into the
matter of losses and profits and how they are
affected by postal legislation and regulations
of various kinds. I agree with the Leader
of the Government that we should accept this
bill and have it passed at once; and that the
Finance Committee, of which I have the
honour to be a member, should then take up
the matters I have mentioned and during this
session make recommendations which might
be the basis of amendments to be introduced
another session.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: May I ask the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
if he is willing to pay the five cents' postage?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I would have to, whether
willingly or not.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
knows that, if the rate goes up to five cents
it will never come down.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It could come down if
a Senate committee, after careful study, so
recommended. I cannot say that such a
recommendation would be made.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That kind of thing bas
never happened yet.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It seems to me that, if
such a recommendation were made, action
on that line would probably be taken.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, what
I was about to observe and I think I am out
of order-is that the suggestion of the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
could not very well be acted upon until the
committee received an instruction from this
house to that effect. Of course, if the house
should direct the committee to inquire into
this subject, I have no doubt that the committee would do its best to investigate the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), 'as chairman of the committee, might make a motion.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: As I said, I think I am out
of order, and I am not going to discuss this
matter further, other than to say this, that
the great bulk of the second-class mail consists not of newspapers but of mail-order
catalogues of all kinds from all sorts of
places.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And the Sunday papers.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have only one observation to make in
connection with this matter. Unfortunately
I could not attend the meeting of the committee; and I have no desire to take part
in the general discussion. I would like, however, to compliment the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) upon his very forcible
and logical address. On only one point would
I take issue with him, and that is with regard
to the five-day week. I cannot agree with
him in attributing the losses or any part of
the losses of the Post Office Department to
the five-day week.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
misunderstood me. I said the Deputy Postmaster General claimed that in order to
handle the mail in a five-day week a larger
staff would be required, resulting in increased
wage costs.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That has nothing to do
with losses in the Post Office Department, for
the department has to pay the going rate of
wages, whatever they may be, and maintain
the general standard of living within each
community. I take issue with those who
blame the wage question for business losses
and suggest that business interests would be
advanced if men worked longer hours and
accepted lower wages. Of course they would.
Wouldn't it be a fine thing for business if
wages were cut out altogether? But, as the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said, we must be realistic. The
five-day week is now the established custom
of industry across Canada, and is the very
principle upon which municipal governments
are operating. Civic employees in Toronto
and Hamilton, for example, are working a
five-day week.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is not the case in
the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps not, but according to my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) the dairy industry is
depressed, and I hope it is not to be accepted
as the guiding industry of this dominion.
Employees of our provincial governments are
also working the five-day week, which has
become the general custom for all federal
civil servants with the exception of the
Post Office employees. The manner in which

SENATE
the department has been operating has made
it difficult to recruit the rank and file of postal
employees. As the Leader of the Government
has said, it would be doubly difficult to
recruit a staff if the government, in resisting
the march of progress, forced its employees
to work longer hours than do industrial
workers and other civil servants.
I compliment the Post Office Department
on the way it has handled this situation. It
inaugurated the five-day week for civil servants in all communities where that custom
was firmly established. There was no obligation or compunction to give postal
employees the five-day week; but why should
they not have it? This is not the nineteenth
century; it is the twentieth century, and
modern production methods are sufficient to
maintain Canada's production level on the
basis of a five-day week. Canada is one of
the largest and best producing countries in
the world, and the efficiency of our government employees cannot be enhanced by
depriving them of the general conditions
enjoyed by industrial and other workers
throughout the world, or certainly on this
continent. I wish to take objection to the
implication that the difficulty in which the
Post Office Department finds itself bas resulted
from the introduction of the five-day week
for its employees. And finally I would point
out that we are certainly not establishing any
precedent.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if he thinks the five-day week is
the established practice in the rural communities of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is becoming so in
rural communities and everywhere else.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Among farmers?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not among farmers.
The honourable gentleman asked me about
rural communities. Farmers constitute only
one portion of our diversely populated rural
communities. Canada is rapidly becoming
an industrial country, and industry today is a
greater factor in Canada's production than
agriculture, important as that is. Farmers
are their own bosses and can work whatever
hours they please, whereas industrial workers
and office employees are in a much different
position.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I did not intend to take part in this
debate. I am not concerned with the fact
that the Post Office Department has been
incurring small deficits in the handling of
registered mail. This service has been given
the public ever since the establishment of the

Post Office Department, and I do not believe
the department would think for one moment
of depriving Canadians of this service now.
I am not very much concerned either about
the inauguration of a shorter working week
for Post Office employees. The department
can hardly expect its employees to work a
six or seven-day week in communities where
industrial and other workers are operating
on a five-day week; and I certainly do not
think it has been proven during this debate
that the department has established the
five-day week unduly. Actually, this is a
small part of the operation of the department and something over which it has really
no control.
There is no doubt that most people are
disappointed that an increase is being made
in the postage on first-class mail. The Post
Office Department is a public service, and
as such some of its branches operate in noncompetitive fields, while others, such as the
second-class mail service, operate in highly
competitive fields. A public service must
support that part of its operations which
function on a competitive basis. In other
words, if part of the service suffers a deficit,
the balance of the service must cover the
deficit, to ensure a successful overall
operation.
I am quite sure that in seeking authority
to increase certain rates the department must
have taken into consideration the large number of new buildings it has erected throughout Canada in order to provide adequate
service. Now, a portion of the construction
costs, together with a portion of the cost of
salaries for additional employees in an
expanding service, must be met by revenue
derived from the second-class mail service.
Consequently, the revenue contributed from
this source is beneficial to the operation of
the first-class mail service. If revenue from
the second-class mail service were to disappear, I am afraid that rates would have
to be doubled on first-class mail. Therefore,
I feel that we should give this whole subject careful study before we force the
department to increase rates on second-class
mail. We must remember that revenue from
the second-class mail service will still permit ordinary first-class mail to be delivered
for five cents. I think we should be very
careful not to interfere with second-class
mail service.
Honourable senators, I am going to support the bill, because I think the Post Office
Department is in a much better position to
consider these questions than we are. We
have not had the benefit of a detailed inquiry,
and I think we should be careful not to

FEBRUARY 25, 1954
destroy the existing arrangement for secondclass mail and run the risk of unfavourable
competition. The department is giving good
service and I do flot think it should be
hindered in its operations.
Han. Norman P. Lambert: Hon-ourable
senators, I wish ta add a few words ta what
has already been said about second-class
mail service. I attended the meeting af the
Transport and Communications commjttee this
morning and listened ta the evidence,
especially that of the Deputy Postmnaster
General, and I could not help feeling that
the question of second-class mail should have
receîved dloser analysis. I feel that is particularly true in view af the references that
have been made here, and I say that with
ail due respect ta the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
1 was brought up in a country newspaper
office, in the days when newspapers were
not as well off as they are today. Two competing weekly papers were published then
where now there is only one.
The Canadian Weekiy Newspaper Association is a very efficient organization, which
serves the interests ai weekly papers in
many ways. There is abundant evidence
that weeklies are doing weil, and that is
gratifying. Their editorials are better expressed than they used ta be, and their
volume af advertising has increased considerably. In short, weeklies are wielding throughout the country an influence far beyond that
of past years. I pay this tribute with conviction, because 1 have observed the growth
of that influence and I know something about
the problems af editing and producing a
weekly newspaper. If a dloser examination af
the functions of the weekly newspaper were
made, more accurate data would be available
than we have thus far received.
Another point I wish ta make is about
second-class mail. Reference has been made
ta the distribution ai daily newspapers by
carrier and by truck. The time element involved does not permit their carrnage by
train. But some publishers ai daily newspapers issue a Sunday edition in the form of
a magazine. These editions, wbich are very
bulky, are sent out eanly in the week in
order ta reach f ar-distant points like Vancouver and Haifax. They are despatched
across the country by train and mail at the
rate of four or five cents a pound, as against
the proposed rate af five cents per ounce
f or letters.
Hanourable senators, I think more information should be obtained and a closer analysis
given ta the proportion of secand-class traffic
handled by the departmnent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I cauld not help feeling
that although the chairman of the committee
afforded every oppartunity ta ask questions,
a good deal more information could have been
given and much more light shed an this
prablem.
Hon. George P. Burchill: Honourable senators, I should like to support what the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has said. I feel very much as
he does on this question. But I have had a
lot of inquiries from people, bath heavy users
ai the mail and ordinary letter writers, asking the very questions put by the honourable
Leader ai the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
And, irankly, I have not been able ta answer
them.
I am not a member of the committee which
considered this bil this marning, and was
not present at the meeting; but I have heard
what the honourable leader opposite, wha
is a member af the committee, has said about
it. After listening this aiternoon ta criticism
of the bonusing of newspapersHon. Mr. Haig: I said "secand-class mail".
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I got the impression
from Ilstening ta the debate that under this
legislation letter writers would be banusing
the new-spapers ai this country. I think that
idea may be a bit unfair to the newspapers.
Perhaps the bill should be passed this
afternoon, but I certainly agree with those
speakers who have said that a closer analysis
should be made ai the whole postal question,
s0 that the people ai this country wiil knaw
what the true situation is. The suggestion
madle by the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mn. Bouffard) may be the answer.
Nevertheless, I think we shauld know the
facts in order that five cents postage may nat
become a permanent impost an the letten
writens ai this country. I am ail in favour
ai further investigation.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
please excuse me if I have not used the
precise English words. If it is more accurate
to say France and England, I am quite ready
to do so, though I do not think it makes a
great deal of difference. The fight is finished
and everybody is happy. The two nationalities are more united than ever, and I think
that result is due to the outcome of that
skirmish. In reality it was one of the greatest
battles ever fought in North America, for it
ended all battles between those two great
races in America, at least.
In 1908, the federal government appropriated to the commission the sum of $300,000,
and at that time the commission also received
from Canadians, English people, Australians
and New Zealanders, sums of money totalling
more than the federal contribution. As a
matter of fact I think those gifts amounted
to $550,000. I would like to mention the names
of a f ew of the donors and the amounts they
gave: The Province of Ontario, $100,000; the
Province of Quebec, $100,000; Nova Scotia,
$10,000; New Brunswick, $7,500; Manitoba,
$10,000; British Columbia, $10,000; Prince
Edward Island, $2,500; Alberta and Saskatchewan $10,000 each. Gifts from Canadian
municipalities amounted to a little more than
$17,000; gifts from institutions in Canada,
Great Britain and other parts of the Empire
reached a total of $3,700; industrial and commercial institutions, and banks in Canada and
elsewhere contributed $16,000; associations in
Canada and elsewhere, $4,000; subscriptions
from individuals in England reached $5,300;
anonymous subscriptions from England and
Canada, $19,700; English subscriptions, special,
$34,000. Thus it will be seen that many people
were interested at that time in the establishment of this great park and its preservation
for all time.
Hon. Mr. Jones: Did the Scotch not give
anything?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: They are included.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They gave their lives.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In 1908 the government
transferred to the commission the properties
it already owned there, and the park was
eventually extended to the east and to the
west. The park now extends as far as
Dufferin Terrace. The amount appropriated
by the government for improving and maintaining the ground as a park has always
been rather small, and many improvements
still have to be made.
The commission is composed of several
men, all of them outstanding in their own
field. Since 1908 the members of the commission have been very devoted to the task
of improving and maintaining the ground,

and have served without any remuneration.
Canadians owe them a debt of gratitude for
the work they have done and the devotion
they have shown. The commission is composed of seven members, five of whom are
nominated by the Government of Canada,
one by the Government of Quebec and one
by the Government of Ontario. The present
commissioners, all of whom have served
devotedly for a long time, are: Lieutenant
Colonel Adjutor Amyot, President; Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Gilbert; James Y.
Murdoch, of Toronto; William Stobo, of
Quebec; Reverend Abbé Arthur Maheux, of
Quebec; the Honourable Wilfrid Bovey, of
Colonel Raymond
Lieutenant
Montreal;
Garneau, of Quebec; and the Honourable
William H. Price, of Toronto.
Since 1948 wages and salaries have
increased everywhere, as everyone knows.
And of course the cost of materials which
have to be purchased for the maintenance
and upkeep of the park are much dearer
than they were before the war. During the
war a part of the park was used by the
Department of National Defence; it bas now
been restored to the control of the commission, and a great deal of work has to be
done to put it back into proper shape. The
demand made by the commission to have
the allocation increased by $25,000 a year for
four years is quite reasonable, and it was
unanimously approved in the other house.
The Battlefield Park is a great asset, not
only to the city of Quebec but to Canada
as a whole, and I hope that this honourable
house will agree to the request of the commission, approved by the government, and
accept the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In his excellent speech
the honourable senator has given us some
useful information, and the sentiment of the
whole house is, of course, with him. However, as a matter of business I think we
should know a little more about what this
money is required for, and how the commission expends its funds.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In the first place, the
commission employs in the winter-time

flowers that are planted each spring.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would suggest that
the bill be referred to the appropriate standing committee, for the publicity which is
often given to matters of this kind when
they are dealt with in committee is extremely
valuable to the Senate. I should like to
press Toronto's claims, just as our honourable colleague (Hon. Mr. Quinn) has for
Halifax, but I am not in a position to do so
at this time for I have not got sufficient
information at hand. I feel it would be worthwhile to refer this bill to committee, where
persons thoroughly informed on the subject-including the honourable member who
has sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)could supply members with detailed information.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 295, an Act to amend

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave, next

SALARIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 172, an Act to amend the
Salaries Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that on January 26 the Prime Minister presented in the other place a single motion
with respect to two bills. The first, Bill 171,

an Act to amend the Senate and House of
Commons Act, has already been passed by
both houses of parliament and received
Royal Assent. Adoption of that legislation
has meant increased indemnities for members of both houses of parliament. The bill
now before the house, Bill 172, an Act to
amend the Salaries Act, unfortunately affects
but one member of this honourable body,
and that member happens to be myself.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Senate will still pass
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Perhaps I should
have used the word "fortunately", for at
least one member of the Senate will derive
benefit from this new legislation. It is with
some diffidence that I present this legislation
to the house. However, this is a government
measure and every member of the government shares in the collective responsibility
for government policies; and it is as a government member that I present this bill for
your consideration.
The purpose of this measure is to increase
the annual salary of the Prime Minister from
$15,000 to $25,000, and the annual salaries
of other members of the cabinet from
$10,000 to $15,000. Perhaps the house would
be interested to hear the history of salaries
paid to the Prime Minister and cabinet members since confederation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the bill provide
for an increase in salary for the Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: An increase in the
annual allowance of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was provided for in Bill
171, an Act to amend the Senate and House
of Commons Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That legislation also provided for increases in the annual allowances
of the Speaker of the House of Commons and
the Leader of the Opposition in that house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Bill 171, an Act to
amend the Senate and House of Commons
Act, authorized an increase in the indemnities of all members of parliament, and also
in the annual allowances of the Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate, the Leader of
the Opposition in the House of Commons,
and the Leader of the Government in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would point out that the
Leader of the Government in the Senate is
not eligible for an annual allowance if he
is in receipt of a salary as a member of the
cabinet.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right. Bill
171 also provided for increases in the annual

FEBRUARY 25, 1954
allowances of the Speaker of the Senate, the
Speaker of the House of Commons, and the
Deputy Speaker of that house.
I started to give a brief history of the
salaries of the Prime Minister and members
of the cabinet since confederation. In 1868
the salary fixed for the Prime Minister was
$5,000, and the same amount was set for
every minister of the cabinet. In 1873 the
Prime Minister's salary was increased to
$8,000, and that of other ministers to $7,000.
In 1907 the salary of the Prime Minister was
increased to $12,000, but the salaries of other
ministers remained at $7,000. In 1920 the
present salary scale was established, that is,
$15,000 for the Prime Minister, and $10,000
for the other ministers.
As to the salary of the Prime Minister, I
think most honourable members of this
house will agree that whoever happens to be
the head of our government in Canada should
receive a salary somewhat commensurate
with his responsibilities.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill before this
house provides for an increase in salary for
the Prime Minister. I am sure that bonourable senators, and all members of the
other house as well, will agree when I say
we are fortunate in having Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent as Prime Minister of
Canada at this time. Personally, I feel that
on his world tour, by extending a spirit of
good will to the people in the various countries he is visiting, he is probably doing more
to bring about a better understanding among
all peoples of the world than the billions
of dollars that we have spent over the
years on defence could ever be hoped to
achieve.

of the United Kingdom receives-as First
Lord of the Treasury rather than as Prime
Minister-a salary of £10,000 per annum.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: For life?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; not only while in
office, but for the rest of his life.
The President of the United States receives
a salary of $100,000 per annum, plus $50,000
taxable expense allowance, plus a nontaxable travelling allowance not exceeding
$40,000.
Under the bill before us it is proposed to
increase our Prime Minister's salary to
$25,000, which, though much lower than
that of the President of the United States
is approximately the same as that of the
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Is that $25,000 taxable?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the salary of
$25,000 is subject to income tax.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question? My
information is that the Prime Minister and
the cabinet ministers of Great Britain receive
salaries, but no indemnity. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information
on that. The honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) may be correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is no indemnity.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Of course, the parliamentary indemnity was considered in another
bill. The present bill deals with salaries. The
question that the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) put is an
interesting one.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that salary not lower
than the salaries paid to a number of deputy
ministers?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, my information
is that in many instances the deputy minister's salary at present is higher than that
of the minister. I believe it is correct to say
that in certain instances that disparity will
prevail even when the minister's salary has
been increased to $15,000.
As honourable senators know, practically
every person in Canada has received an
increase in salary since 1920. The proposed
increase is 50 per cent, and I doubt if there
are many people in Canada whose salaries
today are not 50 per cent higher than what
they received in 1920.
One of the purposes of this bill, as the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has implied, is to try to bring
about a reasonable relationship between the
remuneration of deputy ministers and that
of the heads of the departments. I think
another purpose of the bill-and I believe this
has been expressed-is to bring the salaries
of ministers somewhere in line with those
received by senior executives in other occupations throughout Canada.
I leave the matter with honourable senators, merely repeating that the salaries of
ministers of the crown have not changed
since 1920, and now, after 34 years, it is
proposed to increase the amount by 50 per
cent.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arihur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I think it should be pointed
out that in actual fact the proposed increase
is only a partial increase in respect of its
buying power today. The Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said
that in the early years after confederation
the Prime Minister and the other ministers
of the crown each received $5,000, which at
that time was a lot of money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And there was no income
tax to pay on it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not only was there
no income tax, but the standard of living
then was much different from that of today.
No automobiles, not even a Ford, could be
bought at that time; and the only method of
transportation, until the railways were available, was by horse and cart. Further, the
cost of the upkeep of a family today is far
different from what it was in those days,
because there are more things the family of
today demands and should have. If we go
back only thirty or forty years and compare

the purchasing power of the dollar then with
what it is today, we shall readily see that
an increase in salary, numerically speaking,
may not mean an increase in purchasing
power.
It is absolutely necessary for the dignity of
the country that the men who represent us
in high office should be able to live on a
standard comparable to that of men in similar positions in other countries. They should
not be in such a plight as that described as
his own by the present Minister of Finance,
when speaking in another place a few days
ago. I am thoroughly in accord with this
decent and self-respecting act that we are
now doing, that of giving the men who run
this great country and spend the billions of
dollars raised from the taxpayers a sum
sufficient to maintain themselves in a standard of living which they ought to enjoy.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
with the remarks made by the last speaker
I am quite in agreement. However, there
are one or two things I should like to mention. May I first say that I had a particular reason for asking the honourable leader
a question about the Prime Minister and
other ministers of Great Britain.
As I followed the discussion on this legislation in the other place, it was apparent, as
it often is, that all the details were not
brought out. In dealing with this question of
salaries for the Prime Minister and other
ministers, I think the complete picture should
be placed before parliament and the public
generally.
I prefer the scale of payment of compensations in Great Britain where the Prime
Minister stands high and is paid two and
a half times as much as any other cabinet minister. Why should that not be so? The
key figure in the entire political system is
the Prime Minister. The British Prime Minister gets £10,000, and the rate for the other
cabinet ministers is £4,000. But not all ministers receive that sum, for it is recognized
that some portfolios are not as heavy as
others. I am not suggesting that Canada
should adopt the same differential as Great
Britain has, because I realize how difficult it
would be for a Prime Minister to make
distinction between the responsibilities of
cabinet ministers, from a pay standpoint.
Nevertheless, we all know that in this country some government posts are more onerous
than others.
I am about to make a suggestion affecting
the compensation of cabinet ministers, though
I am fully aware that once a custom has been
established any remarks of mine are unlikely
to change it. Having protested against the

compensation in lieu of a motor car for
cabinet ministers, I have waited a long time
for an opportunity to renew my protest. My
particular criticism is as to the $2,000 motor
car allowance. I was in the other house when
this subject was first introduced, and I am
familiar with the story behind it. There was
good justification for the then Prime Minister,
the late Lord Bennett, to make the change he
did, namely, to sell all ministerial motor cars
and provide a yearly allowance of $2,000 for
each minister. The fact, however, was that
before this arrangement conditions had almost
amounted to a scandal. Certain cabinet ministers were taking the car and chauffeur assigned to them almost around the world, at
the expense of this country. But while the
then Prime Minister changed the arrangement
as to motor cars, human nature, it seems, did
not change. If one looked into the details of
the administration of that day, he might find
out that although $2,000 was allowed to ministers for their motor car and chauffeur, the
amount charged for the- use of taxicabs was
staggering. So it did not solve the problem
of transportation costs.
What I want particularly to point out is
that the motor car allowance was put in Appropriation Act No. 5 of 1931, as vote No.
352, and a similar vote has been made every
year since. I shall read the vote:
To provide for payment annually from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of the sum of $2,000 to
each minister of the crown charged with the
administration of a department, the Solicitor General, and the Leader of the Opposition, and the
sum of $1,000, each to the Speaker of the Senate and
the Speaker of the House of Commons, in lieu of

motor cars and their maintenance, including chauf-

feurs, the acceptance of such sums not to vacate
their respective seats in parliament: and to authorize the Governor in Council to appoint any person
now employed in the public service as a chauffeur
of a passenger automobile at Ottawa, whose position is abolished, to a vacant position in the public
service, provided such chauffeur bas been continuously employed as such for at least two years
and that the appointment will be made at no higher
remuneration than he is now receiving.

I am one of those who believe that the
Prime Minister should be placed away above
all other cabinet ministers. I believe he
should have the finest automobile and the
best looking chauffeur to take him around,
all in keeping with the dignity of his high
office. I prefer not to mention any names on
the question of allowances to cabinet ministers, but I have known some who collected
their $2,000 for a motor car and chauffeur,
but who had no car and no chauffeur, and
every time they travelled by air or train
they went at government expense. I am
against the policy of handing out $2,000 for
something that is not used. The allowance,
when it was made in 1931, was for a specific
purpose. I spoke against the principle of the

allowance at that time, and I still believe that
it should not be paid. The only opportunity
I have had to raise the subject is under the
Salaries Bill. I hope I am in order in doing so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think you are in order.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know there are some who
are fond of calling me out of order on the
least provocation.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Don't anticipate trouble.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have no fear of trouble.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You have never run away
from it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I honestly believe the motor
car allowance should be eliminated.
While I agree with the remarks of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) as to salaries, I would
prefer to compare the rate of pay of our
Prime Minister, not with that of the President
of the United States or the Prime Minister of
Britain, but with that of men in high positions in business in Canada, who are paid
as much as $50,000 and $70,000. The Prime
Minister will receive an increased salary,
but in my opinion it should be higher.
What I am wondering about, though, is
why was it ever proposed to give the Leader
of the Opposition in the other place a salary
equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. I
do not know of any reason for that proposal.
We say little about it, except outside of
parliament. We say, "Let it go." Some say
that we, ourselves, have been given an
increase of so much, so why should we
worry? I criticize this increase to the Leader
of the Opposition because the duties of his
office are small compared with those of the
Prime Minister or of any other cabinet
minister.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: How do you know? You
have never been Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have been in opposition,
but I have never been leader. When we discuss these matters we often compare our
parliamentary system to the British parliamentary system, and at other times we turn
to the United States for a comparison. The
Leader of the Opposition at Westminister is
paid only half of what a cabinet minister
receives. I think that Mr. Atlee, as leader
of a large opposition party, is entitled to
£2,000 yearly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does not the Leader of the
Opposition in the United Kingdom parliament
receive the same salary as a cabinet minister?
I think the present leader receives the same
salary as the Prime Minister.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think not, but of course
the leader of the Labour Party has not always
been a former Prime Minister. The present
leader of that party in the United Kingdom
happens to be a former Prime Minister, but
if a new leader came along, as well one
might, he would receive only a salary of
£2,000.
Perhaps I stand alone in my thinking on
this, but I wanted to take this occasion to
suggest to honourable senators that if the
ministers' motor car allowance is to be
retained, and the salary increased the proposed scale as well, then let it be done
decently; and instead of saying that they are
to be paid $15,000 yearly, let us state the
amount as $17,000. At present this $2,000
motor car allowance is a hidden gift and,
furthermore, it is tax free. I would like to
see us above-board on the facts.
I am not in favour of paying the Leader of
the Opposition the same salary as is paid to a
cabinet minister. And I am still of the
opinion that a cabinet minister's salary is too
close to that of the Prime Minister who, after
all, holds the key position in parliament,
occupying as he does the highest position in
political life in this country. Those remarks
of mine would apply to anyone who is Prime
Minister of the country. I do not know if
anything will be done about it: in fact, I
doubt if anything will, but still I raise my
voice in protest against this item.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to speak on the bill, but I
challenge the statement of the honourable
member for New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) that the Leader of the Opposition in
the other place, no matter who he may be,
is not entitled to receive the same remuneration as a cabinet minister. The Leader of
the Opposition in the other place holds the
most important position in Canada, outside
that of the Prime Minister. He is a man
who could possibly be Prime Minister.
Nobody is under such close scrutiny as is
the Leader of the Opposition. He cannot
carry on any private business while holding
that position.
I remember that in 1927, after the appointment of the late Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett as leader of the Conservative party,
I drove with him up Portage Avenue in
Winnipeg. On that occasion Mr. Bennett
told me that he had sold all stocks he owned
in every company he was interested in
because, as he said, he wanted to be able to
stand up in the house and say be did not
own stock in any company. At that time I
thought he was a perfect jackass to do that,

because the prices of stocks were rising. But
apparently he was right, though I did not
know it.
However, the point is that, under our system of government, the Leader of the Opposition does a magnificent work for this country.
Some people may say that the present
Leader of the Opposition is not as competent
as the present Prime Minister. That is a
matter of opinion, of course.
The office
demands that a man give his full time in
service to it; and I venture again to say that,
excepting the Prime Minister, and maybe not
excluding even him, the Leader of the
Opposition spends more time on public
affairs than any other member of parliament. His time is fully occupied with the
onerous duties of his office, for even if he
did not feel inclined to perform them, party
members would compel him to do so. I
think Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the first Leader
of the Opposition to be paid a salary. As
a young man at that time I thought it was
a move in the right direction, because I am
sure it made him feel that he was an integral
part of the parliamentary life of this country.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I should like to point out that the
question raised by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
regarding the $2,000 motor car allowance is
not referred to in this bill and could be
eliminated at any time without an act of
parliament.
The honourable member is
quite within his rights in calling attention
to this item. It is a good thing, I think, to
have members in this house who do see the
flies in the ointment occasionally. I think,
however, that on this occasion, emphasis has
to be placed in another direction. Living in
Ottawa as I do, I have for some time been
fairly close, in an intimate way, to ministers

I often wonder if our people really have an

us, at some time in our lives, have benefited
by the services of the nursing profession, I
would like to make a brief explanation. The
main purpose of the bill is to permit the
Association of Registered Nurses of Newfoundland to become an association member
of the Canadian Nurses' Association.
The Canadian Nurses' Association was
incorporated by special Act of Parliament,
chapter 88 of the Statutes of 1947. The
association existed for thirty-five years before
that as an unincorporated association.
As the federation of nine of the Provincial
Nurses Associations, it represents the registered nurses of Canada in the eyes of the
people of Canada. It is a member of the
International Council of Nurses and as such
it is the recognized voice of Canadian nursing in the international field. The membership of the Canadian Nurses' Association
as of December 31, 1953 was 35,195 registered
nurses.
There are in Canada 171 schools of nursing,
with a total enrolment of 15,713 student
nurses. These schools graduate, in all, approximately 4,000 nurses per year. In addition,
there are 14 university schools of nursing
giving post-graduate courses for nurses, and
in some instances basic nursing preparation.
The members of the Canadian Nurses'
Association had a splendid record of service
in the last war, when 3,040 registered nurses
were on active service with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, 280 with the Royal
Canadian Navy, 450 with the Royal Canadian
Air Force. As well. 300 volunteered for
service in the South African Military Nursing
services: a total of 5,070 on active service.
Some 500 decorations were awarded to Canadian registered nurses.
The objects of the Association, which are
set out in the 1947 incorporating act are:
(a) To dignify the profession of nursing by
maintaining and improving the ethical and
professional standards of nursing education
and service; (b) to encourage its members
to participate in affairs promoting the public
welfare; (c) to promote the best interests of
the nurses of Canada and to maintain national
unity among them; (d) to encourage an
attitude of mutual understanding with the
nurses of other countries.
The purpose of the present bill is to permit
the Association of Registered Nurses of Newfoundland to be included as an association
member of the Canadian Nurses' Association.
In 1947, when the incorporating act was
passed, Newfoundland not being within confederation, the Newfoundland association was
not included as an association member. The
Association of Registered Nurses of Newfoundland has applied for membership in

the Canadian Nurses' Association, and the
Canadian body wishes to accord membership
to the Newfoundland association. The nurses
of Newfoundland have pledged their willingness to accept the responsibilities and privileges which membership in the Canadian
Nurses' Association will involve.
The bill contains a secondary provision of
a minor nature. Since the Association was
incorporated the Registered Nurses' Association of Prince Edward Island, one of the
association members listed in section 60 of
the incorporating act, has changed its name
to the Association of Nurses of Prince Edward
Island, and it is desired to properly describe
that body in the statute.
I might say a further word for the information of honourable senators about the
Association of Registered Nurses of Newfoundland. In the past the registration of
nurses in Newfoundland was the responsibility of the Department of Health of Newfoundland. At the request of the Graduate
Nurses Association of Newfoundland the
nurses were given the responsibility of
setting the standards for professional nursing
by the enactment on December 20, 1953, of
the Newfoundland Registered Nurses Act.
Thereafter the Graduate Nurses Association
of Newfoundland ceased to exist and was
superseded by the Association of Registered
Nurses of Newfoundland, the incorporation of
which was provided for in the provincial
statute.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable members,
there is nothing contentious in this bill and
ordinarily it would be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills. However, in order to obviate the
necessity for calling a meeting of that committee to deal with one piece of legislation,
I would move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, which, I understand, will be meeting
shortly to consider other legislation.
The motion was agreed to.

INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Roebuck inquired of the government:
What is the reason or justification, if any, for the
exclusion of the public from the reading of prayers
at the commencement of Senate sittings?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer to the
honourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
On April 24, 1868, the Senate adopted a resolution
which provided for the reading of prayers in
accordance with the practice which prevailed at
that time in the Parliament of England. This practice was to read prayers every day before the
opening of the doors and has since been followed
in the Senate of Canada.

MARCH 2, 1954
CANADIAN FORCES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved the third reading of Bill 80, an Act respecting the Canadian
Forces.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, in
committee I took objection to the amendments
to five statutes going through in one bill.
Since then my opinion has been strengthened
by that of several able lawyers, that this is
not a proper way to amend legislation. It
would have been much better for this house,
or for the other place, to have had each of
the five acts amended separately.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: For the benefit of the
public.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would be much better
for the house itself, and also very much
better for the public. It takes considerable
time and trouble to trace the various amendments of a statute in the law texts, and it
is far more satisfactory to have one act
amended by one bill. As far as my knowledge goes, that is the practice in all legislatures and parliaments. In 1924 the Revised
Statutes of Manitoba were amended by the
legislature. Counsel were appointed, at a cost
of about $20,000 to $25,000, to make the
revision. The amending of statutes is quite a
difficult job, and it has to be done very carefully and minutely in order to avoid mistakes.
In that same year the legislature passed an
overriding statute to give effect to all the
amending statutes up to that date, without
revising the main statute. The revision took
about four or five years, and it was a good
thing for the lawyers-I admit that. But the
ordinary layman could not find out what the
law was at all; he was just lost; all he could
do was to consult the different statutes and
hunt up the amendments; and probably he
could not find some of them, and even if
he did he could not correlate them. That
system has been done away with now.
Of course, I know it would be a little more
difficult for the draftsmen of government
legislation to take each act and amend it, but
that method would be simpler to deal with
in committee. In this particular instance,
we had five different acts before us in committee, and we were obliged to take the
word of the expert from the Department of
National Defence as to whether the amendments in each case were satisfactory. The
expert may be honest and fair, but our duty
is to understand the effect of amendments
on the legislation as it exists. That is more
the responsibility of this house than of the
other place, because we are concerned rather
with the legislation itself than with public
83280-22à

opinion. Our object is to pass the best legislation for the people of Canada as a whole,
and in terms that they understand.
I am not going to vote against the passing
of this bill-the committee has reported it,
anyway-but I would suggest that in future
when an act is to be amended, a bill be put
through for that act by itself. It would not
take much longer to draft a separate bill for
each act, and both this house and the other
place would find it much more satisfactory
if that procedure were followed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I agree to a certain extent with what the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said. Probably it would be
more convenient if each act were amended
separately. However, the bill has received
second reading in this bouse and the principle
of the bill has been adopted. Also, the bill
has gone to committee and, as my honourable
friend said, bas been reported back without
amendment.
Honourable senators will recall that this
is at least the fourth year in which a bill
similar to this one has been passed by parliament. Therefore, it is nothing new; in this
legislation parliament is just following an
established custom.
As the honourable
leader opposite has said, the procedure has
some undesirable features.
I assure the
house that I shall bring his suggestion to
the attention of the Department of National
Defence.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill 295, an Act to amend
the Export Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it was my
privilege just ten years ago this summer to
introduce in the other house the original
legislation which this bill proposes to amend.
When the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) asked me to
explain this bill, my first thought was that

En

332

SENAl.

I should go over it clause by clause, but on
second thought I decided it would perhaps
be better to give a rather short summary of
the proposed legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is quite right.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: The purpose of this
amendment to the Export Credits Insurance
Act is outlined in the bill before us, and
affects only Part I of the Act which has to
do with insurance granted to Canadian
exporters to foreign countries. Part II of
the Act, under which the authority was
given to make loans to foreign governments,
is not affected by this amendment.
The Export Credits Insurance Act was
passed as I said, in 1944 with a view to
assisting exporters in trade with various
countries during and following the close of
hostilities in which we were engaged at that
time. Its purpose was to establish a corporation which would issue such contracts of
insurance to an exporter-and I now quote
from the original legislationto insure him against any risk of loss in connection
with the export, or an agreement for the export,
of goods, by reason of the failure of the exporter,
for any cause not avoidable by the exporter, to
recover the selling price of the goods.

In this way it was proposed to assist in
developing and facilitating trade between
Canada and other countries.
These purposes have been accomplished
and much trade has been encouraged on the
part of private exporters, which 'otherwise
we would not have enjoyed.
It should be noted also that there are no
private commercial concerns providing this
type of insurance. In all other countries
where there is similar insurance available,
it is provided by the government or with
government backing.
Let me review for you briefly just how the
Export Credits Insurance Corporation protects exporters who would otherwise face
unexpected and unpreventable losses. Risks
covered by the corporation include insolvency
of a foreign buyer, cancellation of an import
licence in the country of destination, and
the risk of adverse changes in foreign exchange regulations. It does not, however, cover
trade disputes as to the quality or quantity
of goods received. Although it will insure
against delays in collection, if the delay is
not attributable to the exporter, it does not
cover repudiation on the part of the buyer
if the buyer is able to pay for the goods.
However, if the exporter secures a court
judgment and the judgment cannot be satisfied, the corporation would have to pay the

AT

exporter and take over his claim. The insurance also may cover any blockage of funds or
transfer difficulties which would prevent payment in the currency agreed upon at the time
of sale. It also covers war or revolution in
the country of the buyer.
Because this assistance is available to exporters, many have found it easier to
obtain financial assistance from their banks.
Although the exporter has to compete in
world markets on the basis of quality and
price, the encouragement offered by this legislation stimulates a flow of trade which would
not otherwise take place.
In order that a broad spread of risk may
be achieved, the corporation requires its
policyholders, exporting consumer goods, to
insure all their export sales for a twelvemonth period, excluding sales made to the
United States, or sales made against irrevocable letters of credit. Really this is a reporting
policy to cover future sales in a twelvemonth period. Its policies also provide for
payment to a maximum of eighty-five per
cent of the contract price, leaving fifteen per
cent to be borne by the policy holder.
One of the purposes sought in establishing
this corporation was that it would operate
on a self-supporting basis. Up until now the
corporation has insured $235 million of goods
exported to more than a hundred different
countries. On this bulk of business gross
claims paid have totalled $3-9 million, the
bulk of which has arisen due to exchange
transfer difficulties. Recovery of $1.7 million has been obtained while only $138,000
has been written off as non-recoverable. It
is the hope of the corporation that the amount
outstanding will be collected.
The net outstanding claims at December 31,
1953, totalled $2 million, of which it is
expected that the major portion will be
recovered. The average premium rate is 82
cents on $100, or less than one per cent of
the selling price. The total premiums, plus
interest, on the corporation's capital have
covered operating expenses and net claims
paid, and resulted in a balance to the credit
of the underwriting reserve of the corporation in the amount of $1 million. In other
words, they have paid all expenses and all
claims and are $1 million to the good.
At present the corporation's capital is $10
million. It is authorized to take on risks up
to ten times that amount, or $100 million. The
corporation's capital and the capital alone
is what provides the guarantee. Therefore,
the board of directors must make sure that
the capital is sufficient to meet any normal
losses. The board of directors must, of course,

MARCH 2, 1954
be careful not to take on liabilities in any one
foreign country which might be excessive in
relation to its capital. This results in a
limitation in the corporation's activities,
because large amounts are involved in sales
of agricultural equipment and such goods as
locomotives, which are presently being
shipped to individual countries. This is the
type of business which the corporation originally intended to handle, and yet it cannot at
present commit itself to too great an amount
in one area.
Although section 21 of the act allows the
governor in council to authorize the corporation to insure where the insurance would
impose a liability for a term, or amount,
beyond that normally undertaken, it is felt
that this measure should not be adopted to
insure normal business which the corporation
might handle, if it had sufficient capital. That
is the reason for increasing the authorized
capital from $5 million to $15 million, which,
together with its $5 million capital surplus,
would provide government backing of $20
million, and would enable the corporation to
finance sales to the extent of $200 million.
A section of the present amendment
requires that the corporation credit the entire
excess of revenue over expenses and losses
to an underwriting reserve. Since it was
founded, the corporation has followed the
practice of crediting its excess to such a
reserve account. This amendment makes it
mandatory to continue this procedure until
the reserve reaches $5 million, and in order
that funds may be available to cover future
claims.
As I said earlier, the corporation does not
insure exports to the United States because
there is a private insurance company which
undertakes to insure such credit risks. For
that reason, two-thirds of Canada's total
exports are not insured by the corporation.
In addition, many of our major exports, such
as wheat, newsprint and metal, are sold on a
cash basis and, therefore, no insurance is
required.
As I said in the beginning, it is impossible
for private insurance companies, anywhere in
the world, to undertake insurance which
would have world-wide coverage, and I think
it will be agreed that the operation under this
act has been eminently helpful in developing
foreign trade.
I am sure that honourable senators will
wish to ask a number of detailed questions
pertaining to operations of the corporation.
If there are any questions to be asked now,
I shall do my best to answer them, but it is
my intention to move, after second reading,

that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further study and consideration.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I find it rather curious that,
as my friend says, there is no company
that will undertake to insure these risks for
the benefit of exporters. Would not Lloyd's
take that sort of insurance?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Whether people would
insure with Lloyd's or not is a different
question, but there is no question of doing that
business at the present time. The American
Credit Indemnity Company does insure
ordinary sales to the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Just one other question:
Who are the members of the corporation?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: The corporation consists, I think, of about seven or eight persons,
largely civil servants, and in addition there
is an advisory committee selected from right
across the dominion of Canada. Information
on this point was given during the debate in
the other place.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has the Minister of Trade
and Commerce any authority over the
corporation?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: The Deputy Minister
of the department is one of the important
members of the corporation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not ask this to be contentious, but was it under this act that ships
were sold to a Chinese company?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: That was done under
part II of the act, which has lapsed. The
transaction was handled through the Department of Finance, not through this corporation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is that sale included in the
list to which the honourable senator referred?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought he mentioned an
amount of $138,000. It must be larger than
that; I think it is ten or twelve million
dollars.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: The sale of those
ships has nothing to do with the present bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did not the money come
from the same source?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: No, it was loaned
through another department of government,
and under different legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee

Section 2 of this bill, honourable members,
would simply make the bill retroactive to the
lst of May, 1953. That is, as I understand it,
so that larger compensation can be authorized
for hogs that went down with cholera in
Ontario last spring. I think there were some
3,075 hogs, for which about $75,000 has already been paid in compensation, but it is
felt that if some fairer and more generous
compensation were allowed to the owners of
diseased livestock, this would be an encouragement to cleaning up as quickly as possible
anj infectious or contagious disease.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How can you tell what
those animals were worth at that time?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: If this bill should

I would move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, where
we would have in attendance the Veterinary
Director General, who could answer any
detailed questions that members might wish
to ask.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Does this bill include provision for poultry?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Just livestock?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And hogs and sheep.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I may mention to the
honourable member from St. John's (Hon.
Mr. Baird) that poultry is inspected and,
where necessary, quarantined, and in some
cases slaughtered. Compensation is paid.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: There is only one comment I wish to make on the bill, and I shall
follow it up, if I may, with a question to
the honourable senator who has explained it.
The comment has to do with the retroactive feature. This additional compensation provision is to be retroactive to May 1
last year. Retroactivity is a principle which
should be very cautiously and carefully
applied. In the past, at any rate until recent
years, parliament was steadily against adoption of the retroactive principle, and there
is much to be said in favour of that attitude.
If the door is opened in a matter of this
kind to the application of retroactive provisions, we shall find that it will be pressed
steadily more and more open, and Ujtinately
we may find ourselves in a good deal of
trouble. In any case the point, I think, is
worth considering.
The question I wish to ask my honourable
friend is, whether I am correct in assuming

that compensation will be paid only when
the slaughter of the diseased animals is
directed by officials of the department.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is correct. Compensation will be paid only when the animals
have been slaughtered under orders of the
departmental veterinary services.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, the bill

PRIVATE BILL
NORTH AMERICAN BAPTISTS OF CANADA-

SECOND READING
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh moved the
second reading of Bill G-11, an Act to incorporate North American Baptists of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, one of the
main objectives of this bill to incorporate
the North American Baptists of Canada is to
enable them to hold title to property within
Canada and in any of the provinces. The
bill follows the usual form in respect of
religious organizations.
My information is that, at the present
time, there is an association of Baptist
churches, with charges in both Canada and
the United States, known as the North
American Baptists. The North American
Baptists General Conference meets every
third year, with each church having the
right to appoint delegates to represent them
at the conference. Between meetings of the
General Conference, their affairs are managed
by a Board of Directors, known as the
General Council, which meets annually and
has authority to deal with all matters concerning the church, with the exception of a
change in the constitution.
The first General Conference was held in
1843 at which member churches were organized, but the first conference in Canada, for
which minutes are available, was held in
Wilmot, Nova Scotia, in 1865. I understand
those charges in the Maritimes have been
absorbed by other Baptist societies, for at
the present time there are no churches,
either in the maritime provinces or Quebec,
affiliated with the North American Baptists.
The present headquarters is located in
Forest-Park, Illinois, but it is proposed under
this bill to incorporate the Canadian churches
of this body as a separate Canadian society,
with headquarters at Ottawa. Honourable
senators will note that a provisional Board of
Directors is named in the bill.

SENATE
Most of the churches which desire to be
incorporated under this bill are located in
western Canada. At the present time there
are sixty-two of these churches in Canada,
with total membership of more than 9,000.
The breakdown by provinces is as follows:
Churches Members
Ontario ............

Manitoba ..........
Saskatchewan .....
Alberta ............
British Columbia ...

The Society has sixty foreign missions,
chiefly in West Africa and Japan. It also
has 307 women's missionary unions, with
8,600 members.
I know very little of this particular branch
of the Baptist Church, having attended only
one of its services. But I have some knowledge
of its work, as I am acquainted with members
of the Calvary Baptist Church in Wetaskiwin,
and the Bethany Baptist Church in Camrose,
two of the charges asking to be incorporated
under this bill. There are also churches in
Edmonton and Calgary, as well as in eighteen
other points in the province of Alberta.
There is, at the present time, a group of
Baptist churches in the west, incorporated
under the name "Baptist Union of Western
Canada", but the group desiring incorporation
under this bill is not affiliated with that body.
Honourable senators, if the bill receives
second reading I will move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the Orders of the
Day are proceeded with, I should like to
direct a question to the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
I understand it is anticipated that some time
next week the National Housing Bill will
come before the Senate from the other house.
The Banking and Commerce Commitee of the
other house has been studying this bill for
several weeks now, and a verbatim report has
been made of the commitee's proceedings.
Before the bill itself comes over to us I should
like to have an opportunity to read the evidence taken before that committee, and I
wonder if the Leader of the Government
could take steps to expedite the placing of
copies of the report in our hands.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The evidence taken
on the National Housing Bill by the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the other place
bas been printed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have not seen any of it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have received a
copy of the printed evidence.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So have I.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Evidently copies have
been distributed to other members of this
house. The report is available, and if the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) bas not received a copy he
can probably obtain one from another honourable member.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If he will go to my room
my secretary will furnish him with a copy.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I thank honourable senators
for their kindness and co-operation, but I
think I should have been furnished with a
copy.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Possibly the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) did not get his copy because the person
intending to deliver it heard music emanating
from his room and did not dare to knock
at the door.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is a good sign of intelligence when the sounds proceeding from my
room are called music.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should have thought
that in those circumstances two copies would
be delivered to the honourable senator instead
of one.

was read the third time, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before we proceed further with the Orders
of the Day I should like to make a brief
announcement. It is hoped that when we
get through our business this afternoon all
public bills now on the order paper will have
been disposed of, and it is unlikely that we
shall receive any further bills from the other
place today. Probably the next legislation
to reach us will be the housing bill, to which
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has referred. From
inquiries I have made, it appears that it
should be given third reading in the other
place by Wednesday of next week. I am
sure all honourable senators are anxious to
start consideration of that bill as soon as it
is passed by the other house, and if it is
passed there on Wednesday we would like
to give it first reading in this house on
Thursday. Copies of the bill would then be
distributed, and we could go into full consideration of the legislation as soon thereafter as possible. Under the circumstances,
I move that when the bouse rises this afternoon it stand adjourned until Thursday,
March 11, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If this bill receives first
reading in the Senate on Thursday, you propose to adjourn then until the following
Monday?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under the rules of
this house two days must elapse between
first and second readings. On Thursday I

would propose that we adjourn until Monday
night, but in the meantime honourable senators could study the bill. In that way there
would be no delay on the part of this house
in considering the legislation.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN NURSES' ASSOCIATIONTHIRD READING

Hon. Mrs. Wilson, for Hon. Mr. Paterson,

moved the third reading of Bill F-11, an Act
respecting the.Canadian Nurses' Association.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. MacKinnon moved the third
reading of Bill 295, an Act to amend the
Export Credits Insurance Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am going to say just two or three words on
this bill. I want to congratulate the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
MacKinnon) upon the very fine presentation
he made of this bill to this house. And
having been present at the meeting of the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources
this morning, where I listened to explanations
of various phases of the bill, I also congratulate the government upon the young
man it has in charge of this organization.
I must say that he was as good a witness
as ever appeared before the committee. He
discussed the problems concerned in this
legislation and answered every question
without going behind the camouflage of "This
is a question of policy, and we will have to
see the minister". There was never any
question of policy with him. He told us
what the problems were and what the organization was, and we appreciate that very
much indeed.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT RETIRING
ALLOWANCES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved the third reading of Bill 176, an Act to amend the Members
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

A message was received from the House

The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the second

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave, next

DIVORCE PETITION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Farris (for the Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce) presented
the committee's report No. 339, dealing with
a petition for divorce, and moved that the
said report be taken into consideration at the
next meeting.
The motion was agreed to, on division.

On the Orders of the Day:
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
at the last sitting of the Senate, on March 4,
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) said:
May I ask His Honour the Speaker a question?
Under the rules and regulations of the Senate we
are not supposed to refer to the other place as "the
House of Commons". I may say that I myself
never observe that regulation, because I do not see
any good reason for it.
But I notice that His
Honour the Speaker mentions "the House of Commons". I wonder whether he does so because of
any special regulation.

Section 17 of the British North America
Act, 1867, is as follows:
There shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the Senate,
and the House of Commons.

In sending and receiving communications
passing between the two houses the Speaker
adheres to the Forms of Proceeding and
recognized practice in describing the other
branch of the legislature as "the House of
Commons".
There is no rule or regulation of the Senate
that requires the Speaker or other honourable
senators to refer to the other branch of
parliament by any other term than the
expression "House of Commons".
What the honourable senator from Waterloo
probably had reference to was the unwritten
law of parliament that no allusion should
be made in one bouse to the debates and proceedings of the other house during the current session. In this connection I would cite
the following, from Bourinot, 4th edition,
page 357:
It is also a part of the unwritten law of parliament that no allusion should be made in one bouse
to the debates in the other chamber, a rule always
enforced by the Speaker with the utmost strictness.
Members sometimes attempt to evade this rule by
resorting to ambiguous terms of expression-by
referring, for instance, to what happened "in
another place"; but all such evasions of a wholesome practice should be stopped by the Speaker,
when it is evident to whom the allusions are made.
It is perfectly regular, however, to refer to the
official printed records of the other branch of the
legislature, even though the document may not have
been formally asked for and communicated to the
house".

It is very clear then that no attempt on
the part of honourable senators to allude to
the debates and proceedings of the other
branch of parliament, during the current
session, can properly succeed, whether the
expression "House of Commons" or such
apparent evasions as "another place" are used
in the process. On the other hand, when it
is in order to refer to the other branch of
parliament, far from the term "House of
Commons" being out of order, it is indeed the
proper description to use.

SENATE
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the Orders of
the Day are proceeded with, may I direct
the attention of honourable senators to the
fact that there are no public bills on the
order paper. With the exception of the
National Housing Bill, which has been given
first reading here today, no bills have come
to us from the House of Commons. In
accordance with the rule of this -chamber
that two days must elapse between the first
and second readings of a measure, I suggest
that, with the unanimous consent of the
house, we take up the National Housing Bill
as the first order of business on Monday
evening next. As we all know this is an
important and lengthy piece of legislation.
Copies of the bill are being distributed this
afternoon, so honourable senators will have
an opportunity of perusing it and preparing
for its consideration on Monday.
In the circumstances I move that when the
house rises this afternoon it stand adjourned
until Monday night next at eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I inquire of the
honourable Leader of the Government
whether he proposes, after this bill receives
the second reading, to refer it to a standing
committee or to have it considered in committee of the whole?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My feeling is that the
bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. Honourable senators may wish to question some officials from the Bank of Canada and the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
It is my intention, therefore, when the bill
receives the second reading in this house to
move that it be referred to that committee.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: That will be satisfactory.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) asked me to request that the
second reading of the bill be not considered
until Monday next, when he will be present
in the chamber. I understood his thought to
be that the bill should be referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think we can agree
on that course, if it is the wish of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Yes; it is for the house
to decide the procedure to be followed.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon.
tors, I
report
in the

EASTER ADJOURNMENT
J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senanoticed in the press yesterday the
of an announcement that was made
House of Commons as to the period

of the Easter adjournment. I am wondering
if the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has any information
on the same subject for this house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
it is somewhat difficult at this time to say
definitely just how long our Easter adjournment will be. I noticed in the press a report
of the statement made by the Acting Prime
Minister in the House of Commons, and as I
recall he suggested that house should rise
on Wednesday, April 14, and stand adjourned
until Monday, April 26. The length of
adjournment in the Senate will depend to
a considerable extent on the legislation which
comes to us from the House of Commons.
I will follow the proceedings in that house,
and let honourable senators know as soon
as possible what I will suggest for the Easter
adjournment.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to make a remark? A
good deal will depend, it appears to me, on
what date the budget is to be brought down
in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: In the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If the budget is to be
brought down shortly before the Easter
adjournment begins, on April 14, we may
assume from past experience that there will
be at least a two week's debate after the
members of the other place return, on April
26. I would suggest that the leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) give consideration to that
fact when he is reaching his decision as to the
length of adjournment for this House.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I assure the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
that I shall do so. In view of his long
experience in this house and in the House
of Commons, I probably might consult with
him, as he no doubt could assist me in
coming to a conclusion.

He said: Honourable senators, the legislation before us makes substantial changes in
the National Housing Act. The major amendments are:
(a) It replaces the present joint loan technique by a system of mortgage insurance.
(b) It increases the liquidity and transferability of residential mortgages made under
the terms of the National Housing Act.
(c) It provides for continued participation
of the present approved lenders, such as life
insurance, loan and trust companies, as well
as other lenders.
(d) It enables the chartered banks and the
Quebec savings banks to enter the new
residential mortgage lending field.
(e) It provides for the ownership of insured mortgages by individuals and other
lenders, subject to the servicing of the mortgages by an approved lender.
A lot has been said about this bill. The
Banking and Commerce Committee of the
House of Commons held a long series of meetings and heard many witnesses. We also
will have an opportunity in our Banking and
Commerce committee to examine the details
of the various clauses of the bill, as well
as being able to seek explanation from
witnesses.
I feel that at this time we should limit our
considerations to the broad principles of the
bill and its more important implications.

private financing of bouses for Canadians. The
basic principle of the major changes is to
introduce an insurance system which will
encourage private lenders to make insured
mortgages. It is true that the bill provides
that if loans for homes are not available, then
Central Mortgage may make loans on the
same terms and conditions as they would have
been made by private lenders. During the last
eight years the need for such residual lending power has been very evident. There
were certain areas in which the present group
of private lenders were unwilling to operate,
even under the terms of the National Housing
Act. It is the government's view that loans
under the National Housing Act should be
available for every credit-worthy home owner
in every part of the country. We would
greatly prefer that these loans would be
made by private lenders, but if such is not
possible, then the government bas no hesitation in entering the field, but only after every
avenue has been exhausted in trying to get
such financing from private sources.
The insured-loan technique introduced by
this legislation is not an experiment, nor is
it an untried system. In many respects it
follows the procedure in the United States
under the Federal Housing Act, but there
are important modifications to meet Canadian
needs. The principle of the payment of an
insurance premium by a borrower is the
same, but, under our legislation, takes the
form of a single premium capitalized into the
mortgage, whereas in the United States there
is a rather cumbersome procedure whereby
the insurance premium takes the form of
one-half of one per cent of the annual reducing balances. The equivalent premium being
charged in Canada is considerably lower than
in the United States. The loss settlement
payable to approved lenders is on a more
favourable basis than in the United States.
Under our proposals there is provision for
the ownership of insured mortgages by
individuals who are not approved lenders.
These and other modifications are designed
to meet our circumstances.
Perhaps as important as any change in
the legislation is the widening of the group
of approved lenders to include the chartered
banks and the Quebec savings banks. Honourable senators will appreciate that by far the
largest pool of savings of the Canadian
people is in the savings accounts of these
banks. Up to the present, under the provisions of the Bank Act, there has been a
prohibition against the use of these savings
to finance residential construction. Under the
terms of this legislation such prohibition is
being removed.
The provision to make it possible for
individuals other than approved lenders to

own insured mortgage loans is an important
one. It is hoped that by such provision it
will be possible to interest not only private
individuals but estates, pension funds, and
other groups anxious to invest money on a
long-term basis to buy insured mortgage
loans. Should any success attend our efforts
in this respect, then we will find still another
pool of savings to assist in the financing of
our residential construction program.
It will be noticed that the bill contains
important provisions to ensure marketability
and liquidity of insured mortgage loans.
Honourable senators who, like myself, have
had something to do with the investment of
funds of individuals and estates, appreciate
that one of the great difficulties of mortgages
as an investment bas been elements of nonliquidity.
This marketability and liquidity are most
important provisions for the benefit of the
new group of lenders-the chartered banks
and the Quebec savings banks. It seems to
me that, having taken the decision to allow
savings deposited with these institutions to
be used for financing residential construction,
then it is most important not only that the
greatest of security be provided for the
banks, but also that marketability and liquidity be beyond question. A combination of the
facilities provided in the amendments now
being considered to the Bank of Canada Act,
together with clause 11 of this bill, whereby
Central Mortgage is empowered to purchase
and lend against insured mortgages, does this
very thing. I am sure honourable senators
will agree that real doubts might have
existed about legislation which did not contain these important provisions.
Under the new legislation loan ratios have
been increased, resulting in a lower level
of down payments required from the average
home owner. By this step the government
is attempting to widen the band of prospective home owners and to make it easier for
the average Canadian to own his own home.
Likewise, the period of amortization is
being increased. Under the National Housing
Act in its present form the period of amortization has been generally twenty years. Under
the new legislation the usual period will be
twenty-five years, with provision that the
amortization may be as high as thirty years.
This will have the result of reducing the
monthly payments due on the mortgage. By
this means also the band of potential home
owners will be considerably widened.
During the last few weeks there has been
a lot of discussion and even more misunderstanding of a so-called rule of the National
Housing Act that is said to require the new
home owner's income to be such that the

sufficient financing to look after our new- private lenders, and higher loans to meet the

This support by the federal government is
being provided through insurance, with
premiums to be paid by the borrower. It may
well be that the gap to which I have referred
may be bridged without cost to the taxpayer.
I realize that in recent years we have experienced a very buoyant real estate market. I
do not suggest that we will never see the
reverse, but I do think that no one need
anticipate tremendous losses paid by the
federal treasury for loans under the National
Housing Act.
Perhaps as important as the higher-ratio
loans and longer amortization is the continuous flow of money for builders and home
owners so that our housing program may
continue without peaks and valleys. This is
one of the main purposes of the legislation,
and I am sure that honourable senators
would agree that any housing legislation
should have as one of its major objectives a
flow of mortgage money available at all
times. Certainly such an arrangement is a
great advantage to borrowers. Therefore, I
believe that this proposed legislation stands
all the tests that might be applied against it
for suitability to prospective Canadian home
owners.
I now come to the second question: Is it
good for the economy as a whole? I need
not labour the point that in an everexpanding and dynamic economy houses are
required just about as much as new industry
and other forms of development. It seems
to me that anything which will maintain a
high rate of residential construction must be
good for the country as a whole. A combination of family formation and immigration results in a very real requirement for
a continuous increment to our housing stock.
We must be careful to ensure that this supply of new housing units is not impeded by
the lack of financing. To one it seems significant that the new legislation has support
from national organizations of house builders, construction firms and suppliers of
material. They realize that their activities
can only proceed on an even keel if mortgage financing is continuously available.
They know that a vigorous National Housing
Act ensures a continuous and reasonable
level of residential construction activity. I
will not labour this point, because I am sure
that nobody in this house needs convincing
that we must have a high volume of new
housing in Canada for many years to come.
Therefore, I think it can be said that this
legislation is good for the economy as a
whole.
I now come to the third question: Is it
good for our financial institutions? After all,
our financial institutions act as a depository
for the savings of the people, and it is their

duty to invest these savings wisely to provide
safety for their depositors and a reasonable
return to them. We all would oppose any
legislation which was injurious to our
financial institutions.
We take justifiable
pride in both their stability and the manner
in which they have made important contributions to the development of our country.
First, let me say that there is nothing
which forces our lending institutions to make
insured loans if such do not suit their ideas
of a suitable investment. We believe that
insured loans will be a suitable investment
for our life insurance, loan and trust companies, as well as for the banks. In fact,
the whole legislation has been designed to
this end.
The position of the life companies is that
over recent years they have lent full support
to operations under the National Housing
Act. In fact, our very high level of residential construction is a tribute to the manner
in which they have supported the National
Housing Act. In the Prime Minister's statement announcing this legislation, and in the
evidence given before the Banking and
Commerce Committee of the House of Commons, reference was made to the inability of
the life companies to do more in the new
residential field than they are at present
doing. Indeed, some doubts are held that
the life companies can go on indefinitely at
their present rate of investment in the new
housing field. In his evidence before the
Banking and Commerce Committee Mr.
Mansur, the President of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, expressed his
doubts on this score. When the President of
the Dominion Mortgage and Investments
Association, who is a life insurance executive, appeared before the Banking and Commerce Committee, he confirmed the doubts
expressed by Mr. Mansur. From this evidence it seems quite clear that if even the
present level of activity under the National
Housing Act is to be continued we must find
additional lenders. From the life companies'
point of view a widening of the group of
lenders is a good thing, because a burden
was being placed upon them which appeared
to be getting beyond their capacity to carry.
In the case of the loan and trust companies, I believe that the new insured mortgage will be a favourable development. By
the very nature of their business, liquidity,
marketability and transferability will be
important to them. We hope that the new
insured mortgage instrument will appeal to
them and will attract funds from that source.
I now move to the question as to whether
opening this field is favourable to the chartered banks and the Quebec savings banks.

SENATE
The government has given such an important
step full consideration. It is conscious of the
fact that as a result of difficulties in the
United States there is a deep rooted prejudice
in many people's minds against the banks
being in the real estate field. However, if
one examines the situation in the United
States in the early thirties it will be found
that the mortgages in which the banks
invested were of a kind very different from
what is being proposed in this legislation,
and indeed very different from the types of
mortgages now being held by the banks in
the United States. Experience has shown that
the heavy losses during early thirties by the
banks in the United States were occasioned
by their investment in large commercial
loans. Even under the mortgage instrument
of those tiýmes the banks did not suffer heavy
loss in the residential field. But I would
point out that even in respect to the difficulties which the United States banks had in
residential mortgages the circumstances were
entirely different from those we are conThe amortized mortgage,
sidering today.
with principal, interest and taxes being paid
monthly, is a very different type of security
from the conventional loan, with the borrower paying his own taxes and principal
repayments being made once or twice a year.
In addition, the type of mortgages we are
suggesting for the banks carries a government guarantee. In many respects these
mortgages have the characteristics of a government bond. It is true that the approved
lenders bear a small part of any loss, but it
is limited to 2 per cent discount on principal
outstanding and a lower rate of interest after
six months' arrears. It is a reasonable assumption that on the average the loss guarantee
payable by Central Mortgage to an approved
lender for a defaulted loan will be about
97 per cent of the mortgage account at the
date of the transfer of the property to Central
Mortgage.
In addition, and as an added protection to
the banks as well as to other lenders, there
are important liquidity provisions. The banks
can use insured mortgages for rediscount
with the Bank of Canada. In addition there
is provision in clause 11 of this bill for
insured mortgages to be purchased by Central
Mortgage. Quite definitely, traditional mortgage deficiencies of non-liquidity and lack
of security have been removed. If there are
any doubts on this score I would commend
those having doubts to read the evidence
given before the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the House of Commons by the
Governor of the Bank of Canada and the
President of the Canadian Bankers' Association.

During recent weeks we have heard objections to the new arrangement on the ground
that assets of the chartered banks are now
fully employed and that mortgage loans by
the chartered banks would reduce moneys
available for the development of the country.
Dealing with this subject before the Banking
and Commerce Committee, the Governor of
the Bank of Canada stated that he thought
the over-all credit structure would be large
enough to allow these mortgage loans to be
made without leaving the banks short of
funds to fulfil the requirements of their other
customers. In fact, he stated that he could
not see any prospect of existing customers
of the banks finding life more difficult by
reason of the banks lending on mortgages. It
was also stated by the Governor that he
could see no particular difficulty in the chartered banks making loans up to, say, $100
million a year. He went on to point out that
on the safety side the government insurance
was an important item. He felt that in the
matter of liquidity mortgage loans would
represent a relatively small proportion of the
total savings deposits and did not think that
this proportion would ever be high enough
to make liquidity a serious consideration. He
was asked the direct question as to whether,
in his opinion, the prohibition on mortgage
lending by the banks should be lifted. He
replied that he felt it should be lifted and
had felt that way for many years.
If honourable senators will examine the
evidence given by Mr. Atkinson, the President of the Canadian Bankers' Association,
they will fail to find any apprehension
expressed by the banks on account of the
change. Their main concern seems to be
about the requirement that in the event of
default the banks must take steps to take
title to the property. I shall not quote the
evidence given by the banks before the committee to support my case, because Mr.
Atkinson made it perfectly clear that his
answers must all be qualified by the fact that
the banks had had no experience in this field.
However, I think we should bear in mind,
when considering this legislation, that the
mortgage instrument, as well as the arrangements surrounding it, have been designed to
meet the needs of the chartered banks as
well as the other lending institutions. The
bill gives the banks security, liquidity,
marketability, and a good outlet for the
investment of their funds. All of these provisions make it quite impossible for unfavourable developments in the real estate field
to have any injurious effect upon our banking system. Were such possible, the government would never have proposed the change
which we are now considering.

MARCH 15, 1954
Now I come to the question of whether the
proposed arrangements will be effective. During the last few weeks there have been
reports that it would take a very long time
to institute the new arrangements and that
even when they are instituted there will be
no enthusiasm from the present group of
approved lenders and the chartered banks.
Current developments lead me to believe that
such a forecast is quite incorrect.
Central Mortgage has already increased
its branch office system to meet the new
requirements and to provide a day-to-day
service for every branch of every chartered
bank in Canada. An inspection staff to
ensure compliance with plans, specifications
and minimum standards is ready to operate
the day after Royal Assent to this legislation.
The forms are ready, an operating manual
has been prepared, and leaflets explaining
the provisions of the new legislation will be
available immediately after Royal Assent.
It has been said that the chartered banks
are not particularly interested. During recent
weeks continuous consultations have been
taking place between the officials of Central
Mortgage and officers of the chartered banks
who will be responsible for their activity
in this field. In some instances the banks
have already issued instructions to their
branch managers. It seems hard to believe
that so much activity could be under way at
the present time if indeed the banks were
not anxious to participate, and participate
immediately. The President of the Canadian
Bankers' Association made it very clear at
the Banking and Commerce Committee of
the House of Commons that the banks would
give the legislation a fair trial.
Discussions have also been taking place
between Central Mortgage and other lenders,
such as the life insurance companies. From
these discussions there is no reason to believe
that the new arrangement will not provide
a satisfactory outlet for investment of their
funds. I am sure honourable senators will
appreciate that I cannot give absolute assurance on this score, other than to assure them
that there is nothing happening at the
moment that would lead to the belief that
the legislation will not work. In fact, current developments are very contrary to
rumours abroad that the legislation will not
be operative until June, and then only on a
limited basis.
Finally, honourable senators, it seems to me
that the criterion by which the proposed
legislation should be measured is the degree
to which government participation in the
housing field will be conducive to the needs
of our country. We are a rapidly growing

country, in which resources of all kinds are
being developed at a vigorous rate. The
development of new, giant industrial enterprises is quite a spectacular phase of this
growth. Equally important, however, but less
spectacular, is the development of housing so
necessary for the people who make our industrial growth possible. The major purpose of
the legislation is to ensure that this country
will have comprehensive housing legislation
to keep pace with its economic development.
It is not suggested that an insured mortgage loan will be available for every Canadian who wants a new house. However, we
do feel that the proposed legislation will
ensure financing for every Canadian who
wants a new house and is able to make the
down payment and meet the monthly payments on the mortgage under the National
Housing Act. Not only must funds be available to meet all reasonable needs of all creditworthy Canadians, but the funds must be
available on terms and conditions that meet
the requirements of those Canadians. To
maintain a housing program of the present
magnitude we need mortgage financing of an
80 per cent to 90 per cent level, so that the
down payments will be within the capacity of
the average prospective home owner. Such
low down payments cannot be arranged in
the conventional mortgage field without government assistance. That is the purpose of
the legislation we are considering-namely,
an ample supply of mortgage funds on terms
which will allow a house building program
to fit the needs of an ever-expanding country
and to make good some of the backlog of
need accumulated over the war years, when
our efforts were directed to other ends.
Hon. Mr. Haig:
Honourable senators,
may I ask a question? Could the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) give us an
illustration of what he thinks the average
house would cost, what the terms of the
financing would be, and how much money a
man or woman would have to earn in a year
in order to be eligible to buy it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
to answer that question would require much
detailed information, such as will be available when the bill is under study in our
Banking and Commerce committee. Personally, I do not know how much the average
house would cost. The amount of the loan
would be between 80 per cent and 90 per
cent of the lending value. As I have already
said, the monthly payments would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 23 per cent
of the purchaser's income. If it is twentythree or less than twenty-three per cent the
lending institution can make the loan without

SENATE
reference to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation; if it is over 23 per cent, the
loan can be made only after it has been considered by the corporation.
I must admit that I do not know the cost
of houses, and I do not think I am the person
to answer my honourable friend's question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who puts the valuation on
the house, and who makes the estimate of
what the taxes will be?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My understanding of
the bill is that the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation will fix the lending
value. I assume that the estimate of taxes
will be made by the municipality.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Another question: what
will happen in a province where, as in Saskatchewan, proceedings against a home owner
cannot be taken without the order of a judge?
If certain conditions arise, similar laws may
be passed in other provinces. In Saskatchewan, if a home owner defaults the provincial
law prohibits action against him for one year.
Is there any provision in the bill which would
enable the lender, under such circumstances,
to get his money back? As I understand the
law of Saskatchewan, unless he can give title
to the government he cannot demand from
the government the payment of the loan. The
law of Saskatchewan may be duplicated elsewhere-for instance, in Manitoba-should a
recession occur.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is another question which I suggest my honourable friend
should ask the president of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. My information is not sufficiently detailed to enable me to
give an answer. The question may have
arisen during the hearings before the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the House of
Commons, but if it was asked I have not
found in the record any reference to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think it was
asked.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nor do I. The point
is a very interesting one, and I hope the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) will raise it in committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will ask another question:
Is the $250 included in the mortgage over and
above the amount of the loan, and how is it
paid?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is, the insurance
premium?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The insurance
premium is added to the amount of the

mortgage, and is paid by inclusion in the
monthly payments over the period of time
that the mortgage is in effect.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, as
might have been expected, the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has gone to some pains to emphasize
the benefits which this bill will provide to
the lenders. I am concerned about the people
who are going to borrow money under this
scheme. I never like to advise anyone to
enter into these commitments; in fact, I
regret to see anybody bind himself to a
contract running over twenty-five or thirty
years.
Another reflection which occurs to me is
this. At the present time, in my opinion,
rentals from one end of the country to the
other are excessively high. This condition has
given an opportunity to the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation; and if the scheme
which is now proposed should be successful,
as the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) thinks it will be, there
may be a general exodus from many of the
high rental blocks, rows upon rows of which
have been and are being erected in various
parts of the country, and a good many people
will take losses.
Another phase of this matter which concerns
me is, just how long we can afford to build
up our cities and deplete the farm population
of this country. In the past few years the
percentage of the people on the farms to the
whole population has fallen from about 60
per cent to a little over 30 per cent. Yet
the greatest hope for Canada's future is in
her being a food-producing nation. Too many
of our farms are uneconomically large: it
would be much better if there were a larger
number of farms and more people living on
them. Only thus can we hope to support the
bigger cities and maintain employment in the
urban industries.
Too many farm houses are not modern.
In this connection I might mention that
recently I have been trying, in the three
towns nearest to where I live, to get plumbers
to instal the best equipment possible in two
of my farm homes. I agreed to buy the
best appliances I could get, but the firms
I approached have other work on hand and
cannot do anything for me. Not so many
years ago houses were being moved out from
these towns to the farms; now the movement
is the other way.
Reference has already been made to the
cost of the national housing scheme. When
the bill goes to committee I shall want to
know exactly what the lender will stand to
get by way of interest, including the costs

In these days of "Cadillac culture" it is rare to
find young and attractive girls who have any real
value for the old-fashioned type of home.
Brought up on washing machines and kitchen
gadgets which take the work out of many of the
household chores, most of our young spinsters
appear to scorn the simple things which make
a home.
They show more appreciation for
any kind of meal, dished up by a tired short-order
cook, than the most tasty dishes which result from
loving care exerted in the home kitchen.
In view of this, the fact that girls are once again
looking for farmers to marry makes very nearly
headline news.
Maybe a farm is not as exciting as hanging
around the cafes, eating banana splits, and drinking
milk shakes. Maybe these girls will miss the biweekly theatre and the dances to a radio; but what
they get in return will be of greater lasting good.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Macdonald for the second reading of Bill 102,
an Act to promote the construction of new
houses, the repair and modernization of existing houses, and the improvement of housing
and living conditions.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am in difficulty today. I like to make a
speech without any notes at all, but if on
occasion I do prepare notes my supporters,
who are few in number, unanimously agree
that I am the poorest reader that ever stood
up in this chamber. But I have written out
notes on this bill because I wanted the press
to have them. Representatives of the press
cannot say I have spoken too fast or that
they did not hear me, for I handed a copy of
my notes to them four hours ago. Secondly,
I wanted to be able to hand a copy of my
notes to Hansard for purposes of reference,
in case I read too fast or do not make myself
clear.
A bill dealing with housing is an important
piece of legislation. It is bound to be, in any
country, at any time. In my humble opinion,
nothing created by human endeavour contributes more to the life of the nation than
does the house or home where the father and
the mother and the family live together.
I cannot imagine any blight on human progress greater than that caused by the shortage,
the lack, or the destruction of homes. So we

are now addressing ourselves to what is
probably the most important subject that any
legislature can deal with. True, it is our
duty to provide for defence against aggression;
to pass laws dealing with penalties for
offences; to legislate in the interest of new
enterprises, and the like. But foremost in the
minds of us all is the hope that when young
men and young women are ready to take our
places in the activities of life they will be
able to afford, not merely to buy a home, but
to be in a district where a home can be
bought. That, I think, is fundamental.
To come to the consideration of this bill:
I do not think that the things which it is
proposed to do meet the issue at all. I may
be wrong, but I believe that the limit of
demand in Canada for houses which people
can afford to buy, with a reasonable deposit
on the purchase price, and to furnish with
equipment, has been reached, and that the
ordinary activities of the country will take
care of replacements of houses of this kind.
We therefore have to deal under this bill,
whether the government admits it or not,
with a class of people that cannot afford to
buy homes. That may be a very strong
statement, but I am persuaded that no one
who cannot afford to make a cash payment
of more than $2,000 is able to buy a house of
which the minimum price is $12,000, and to
meet also the cost of furniture and equipment. There may be districts which require
more houses, and there, probably, more will
be built and more will be sold, but I do not
believe that under present conditions people
with an income of between $3,200 and $4,000
can afford to buy a $12,000 house. Under
our economy it is not possible, no matter
what anybody says to the contrary. Whether
or not one believes in the principle of the
original housing legislation-and I do not
say I do or I do not-that law, from the
standpoint of economics, went as far as this
or any country can afford to go.
There appears to be only one object to this
bill. The government wants to get right out

present time a down-payment of approximately $2,000 is required on a home costing
$10,000. The balance of $8,000 is mortgaged,
with part of the money being supplied by
the federal government through its agency
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Under this legislation the government will no
longer lend money for house building purposes, and life insurance companies will not
lend for this purpose either, otherwise this
bill would not be before us now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Life insurance companies
have done a large volume of lending for
building purposes.

MARCH 16, 1954
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree with the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
and I shall have something to say about that
later. The point is that the government is
now asking the banks to lend money for this
purpose.
Let me state another fundamental principle.
Since 1867 every government in this country,
whether Liberal, Conservative or Union, has
refused, whenever the Bank Act has been
revised, to authorize banks to lend money on
real estate of any kind.
Yesterday the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said that United States
banks got into trouble because they made
big loans. Their trouble did not arise from
that circumstance at all, but because they
lent money for real estate purposes every
day of the week.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not residential.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Residential and every other
kind.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is not the way
the American banks got into trouble.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They lent money on the
basis of $125 an acre in Iowa, at double the
land value in Chicago, on city blocks in
Minneapolis. It was the same thing all
over the United States. I know something
about lending money on houses and other
real estate, having spent a large part of my
life in a law office which dealt largely with
real estate. I do not know so much about
real estate in British Columbia, Ontario,
Quebec or the Maritime provinces, but I
take second place to no man in Canada in
the matter of understanding real estate in
the Prairie provinces. My knowledge of real
estate extends to transactions involving
private dwellings, office buildings and farm
construction for grain or cattle. I have
been tied in with all this business, and, to
use a slang expression, I have not yet lost
my shirt-though I nearly did so on several
occasions.
About five years ago a real estate organization in Winnipeg was addressed by the
director of an American committee on real
estate which had been carrying on an exhaustive investigation with respect to the
evaluation of housing. He related that the
records for the last 150 years had shown that
property values in his country had consistently reached their highest mark and
lowest mark in a cycle of eighteen years.
The high mark of the cycle had been reached
in nine years, and then prices had begun to
drop with the low point being reached in
the next nine years. He said that two or
three factors, such as wars or national
catastrophes, might have caused a variation
83280-23J

in that cycle, and he said that it never goes
back as low as the point at which it started
up, and that it always goes up a little higher
than the point it reached before. In other
words, if the lowest-priced house cost $1,000
and went up to $6,000, it would not come
back down below $1,500. And the next time
prices went up, instead of the price of this
house stopping at $6,000, it would advance
to $7,000. If the record is examined, it will
be found that there is a similar cycle in
Canada. It usually is not operative during a
war, of course, because an emergency of that
nature often breaks a link in the chain,
through government interference in loaning
schemes, and so on. For instance, in 1950
lots of people said we were faced with the
threat of a depression in this country. Then
came the Korean war, and things started
to boom again. That war would have stopped the trend of real estate values if it had
been on the road down, but after the war the
cycle would operate the same as ever.
Honourable senators, I am persuaded that
practically all the people with capital enough
to buy houses have already bought, although
there may be individual exceptions. And
remember, besides the capital needed to buy
a house, there has to be an additional amount
for furnishing it. I think the people without capital should have rental houses built
for them, and the only solution in that regard
it seems to me, is the one that has been suggested in my province: 75 per cent of the
money to be provided by the dominion government, 12J per cent by the province and
12J per cent by the municipality, that the
money be advanced at a certain low rate of
interest, and that the city manage, rent and
take care of the property. That is the only
hope for that class of people who want a
house to live in and cannot afford to buy one.
I lived through the depression, from 1929
until pretty close to 1939, when the war
broke out, and I saw houses in the city of
Winnipeg classified by the government as
houses for the unemployed, with a rental
of $16 per month, which today are renting
at $75. The $16 a month did not even pay
for the taxes or the insurance on the property.
The same thing was true in Brandon and
Regina, and no doubt in Toronto, Montreal
and other cities. That situation prevailed
for three or four years; and today those very
houses, which were valued even after 1940
at, say $5,000, are selling now for $12,000.
I may be wrong, but it does not seem reasonable to me. So much for the housing
proposition.
I come now to the banks. It is suggested
by the government that plenty of money is
available in the banks, so why not go and

SENATE
get it. I am expressing it in a rough way,
but that is what the government means. In
the past we have been getting money from
the insurance companies. Insurance companies receive money for one purpose,
namely, in return for policies. A company
will sell an insurance policy on a man's or
a woman's life at a yearly premium, and
when the insured dies the company will pay
to his estate or beneficiary a certain sum of
money, according to the contract. It is true
that the insured, while living, may borrow
on or cash in the policy, but the main purpose of the policy is to insure his or her
life. I venture to say that every member
of this house has the same idea about an
insurance policy. Whenever I have discussed
insurance policies with people I have usually
found that they took out insurance in the
same way as I did. I had quite a lot of
it, and it has been fully paid up for some
years. My wife was the beneficiary. I
never cashed or borrowed on my life insurance, because I wanted to know that if I
predeceased my wife she would get the face
value of the policies and have enough money
to live on. No doubt most men buy as
much insurance as they can pay for. Protection is the primary purpose of life insurance in this country, and that is why its
promotion has been so successful. Men and
women-especially men, who earn most of
the money-know that if the bread winner
is suddenly taken out of the picture his
wife and their children, if any, must have
as good a chance of survival as if he had
lived.
On the other hand, the function of the
banks in our economy is to accept money
on deposit, and to have it available to
the depositor at a moment's notice. Any
experienced practising lawyer will have seen
many estates pass through his office, big ones
and little. In my practice it was the small
estates that caused me most concern. I am
thinking of a case such as that where a
father dies and leaves an estate of a total
value of $5,000, including about $300 or $400
on deposit in the bank. The minute the
death occurs the family want that money,
because somebody may be sick or for some
other reason. But anyone at all likes to have
$200 or $500 or $1,000 on deposit in a bank
account, which he knows is available to him
at any time he needs it. That is the true
purpose of the bank as an institution. I challenge anybody to point to financial institutions with a better record than our chartered
banks have had, even throughout the depression years of 1930 to 1935.
The government is now proposing to take
the money on deposit in the banks and lend

it to every Tom, Dick and Harry, tie it up
for the next thirty years. Somebody has said
that properties can be sold and loans
liquidated. Let me say emphatically that
when the going gets tough you just can't
sell houses. As a lawyer I have had people
come and plead with me to help them sell
or get loans on houses they owned, and I
have had to say "I am sorry, but no matter
what your property is worth, it just can't be
sold for a reasonable price."
The crux of the problem posed by this
bill is that it would risk the savings of the
thrifty people of Canada who have saved
their money and put in the bank, only to
have it taken out and lent over a long period
to someone who himself has not been able
to save enough to buy a house.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But the banks are
not obliged to lend the money.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I did not know that my
honourable friend was an experienced man
I would be surprised at his innocence in
making such a remark.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am not as innocent
as I may appear. I say, there is nothing to
compel the banks to lend money.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend will
have his chance to talk; I would prefer not
to have any interruptions. I say quite candidly that if the banks did not lend money
under this legislation they would soon have
a visit f rom Mr. Graham Towers. He has been
given power under this proposed act to invest
large sums of money, and he can force the
banks to make money available, because
they are under his control. Yes, make no
mistake about it: if the banks do not lend
money on houses, there is nothing to this
legislation at all. No bank will lend money
voluntarily on anything but gilt-edged
security. How many banks in Saskatchewan
would lend money under this legislation, if
they did not have to? They would be foolish
to subscribe to loans on real estate, for the
law in that province provides that no proceedings may be taken against a homestead
without first obtaining a judge's order. And
what happens in a typical case when the
parties appear before a judge asking for an
order? The mortgagor will point out that he
is out of a job, that his daughter is working
for $75 a month, and is paying as much as
she can to help keep the home together. He
will say: "We cannot pay the $50 a month we
owe under this mortgage; we can pay $10,
$20 or $25 a month, and if you do not take
that we will lose the house and have to move
out with our five children". Do you think
the judge will make an order? Well, not if I
know anything about what is usually done

MARCH 16, 1954
in these cases. And if you cannot get the
proceedings completed in a year after default
you cannot make the government take the
mortgage, because that is what is said here.
If the banks do not have to lend the money
-and I am surprised that my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) even suggests
that-then the bill means nothing, and all we
need is an amendment to the Bank Act to
allow the banks to make loans on real estate.
But I know enough about life to be sure that
if this bill becomes law and the banks refuse
to lend money they will hear from the government.
And who will take the onus when proceedings need to be started? When my office
starts foreclosure proceedings for some life
insurance company which we represent, in
comes a fellow who says, "Well, Haig, I see
you have started proceedings against my
house". I say in reply: "You haven't paid
anything on this mortgage for some time;
your taxes are two years in arrears; your
insurance lapsed last week and you did not
renew it, so we had to pay the premium. I
sent a man up to look at your house, and
although you owe us $6,000 he says that your
place is worth only $5,000. Sure, it was a
$12,000 house when the government started
in with it, but now it is down to $5,000. What
about it?" He then tells me: "You will hear
about it. It will be told up and down this city
what a company that is, that as soon as it
can get after somebody, that person loses
his home." It will be the same with the
"grafting" banks. That is what happens
every time. Any of you who have been in
law practice some years and went through
the depression know from actual experience
that that is what happened. I know that is
what happened in the province of Saskatchewan, where my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Horner) came from. He has heard all this
talk about the loan companies-yes, even
about the Dominion Life Assurance Company, of which my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is a director, and
also about the Great West Life Assurance
Company, of which my honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is a
director. They said in Saskatchewan that
these companies were grafting companies
because they tried to take the farms from
the farmers. People said to those companies,
"You are stealing our land".
That is the situation under this bill. The
onus is put on the banks, which have been
trying for years and years to build up a good
feeling between themselves and their customers, their depositors or their borrowers.
It is feared that this bill might jeopardize
that good feeling.

I ask my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) about foreclosure under the bill.
If we get into tighter times-if for instance,
we cannot sell our wheat-where are purchasers going to get the money to pay the
instalments on their houses in the towns?
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) recently told us that rural merchants in Saskatchewan are refusing to sell
goods on credit, that transactions must be
cash on the barrel-head, or no goods. The
merchants say, "What else can we do?" They
point out to the farmers: "You have sold only
five bushels of wheat per acre to the government, that is all you have been paid for, and
the money you have received will pay only a
few accounts that you owe us. You owe us a
lot of money now, and we are not going to
give you any more credit." That is the existing situation, and it can get worse. I hope it
gets better. God help our Western country
if we do not find some place to sel our grain
to. We face the competition of the United
States, which are loaded down with commodities and have huge supplies ready to place on
world markets. All down the river the boats
are loaded with wheat and there is nowhere
to unload them. Our elevators in Saskatchewan are filled with grain which cannot be
shipped. We have not sold any of the 1953
crop. The only wheat we have sold has come
from the 1952 crop, and only 148 million
bushels of the 1952 crop was unsold. Now
that is the situation that can arise in a
country in which there is no depression at
all, because surely a carry-over of six or seven
hundred million bushels of wheat in Canada
does not signify depression. It would mean
depression if we could not sell it, though.
Well, in a situation like that what are people
going to do to raise the money to pay the
bank? And if the bank does not get title
within one year after default the government
does not have to take over the mortgage.
That is what the legal language in this bill
says.
For these reasons I do not think this legislation should be passed. I candidly believe
that the solution is the one I suggested earlier
in my address, namely, that the government
should advance 75 per cent of the money
required for building rental houses at an
interest rate as low as 3 per cent, that the
provincial governments and the municipalities
should advance the remainder in equal proportions, and that the houses should be rented
and managed by the municipalities which are
closer to this situation than any other level
of government. If they had to put up 121
per cent of the money they would look after
the management of things and people would
be given homes, and without any foreclosure

SENATE
proceedings people who did not pay could
easily be dispossessed and others who would
pay would move in.
I am not going to take up further time,
although I do not want to overlook anything
in the notes that I gave to the press.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt
my friend, but does he suggest that the
municipalities put up 12J per cent of the
cost?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Where would they get the
money?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Where they get it now.
Winnipeg is borrowing $4 million at the
present time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: From the banks?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, from the bondholders
of Canada. They like our security. I am
sorry if your town is not as good security as
is Winnipeg. My city borrows very easily.
Six months ago it offered to sell me some
bonds which have gone up about a point
since then.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There would have to be a
change in the law as to the maximum
amount they can borrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That would be covered in
the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That would have to be
done by the province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Our province would do it
quite easily and gladly. We have a government that just loves to help Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Maybe.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let us go back to what I
was saying. I asked my honourable friend
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) what a man earning $3,600 a year
could pay on the charges for a loan. Well, I
want to give him a little more latitude. Let
us describe the purchaser as a man earning
$4,000 a year. How can he afford to pay the
interest and principal on a $12,500 loan,
together with the taxes? Why, the taxes
on that type of a house in our municipality
range from $300 to $350 a year. I have a
house on a street on which all the improvements are paid for, yet the taxes amount
to $275 a year. The city evaluated it the
other day at $13,500. I think that they are a
little high in that valuation, but that is only
$1,000 more than the ordinary house would
cost under this legislation. I have seen in
Winnipeg the $10,500 house built by the
government and it is not as good a house as
mine is, by a long way. To build, it would
not come within $3,000 of the cost of my

house, which although twenty years old
is valued at $13,500, and on my house I am
paying $275 a year taxes. If you were to
add to that 5j per -cent interest on the
$12,500 loan, you would arrive at a figure
that I do not think a man earning $4,000 a
year can pay. At the present time his
$4,000, in relation to the value of money
fifteen years ago, is worth only $2,000. The
cost of living is up nearly 100 per cent, as
we all know, and his purchasing power is
thereby cut down.
For these reasons I plead with the government to reconsider this whole bill. I do net
think it is fair to the commercial interests
of Canada te drain away from the banking
institutions money needed to finance the
mercantile activities of this country. Mercantile loans are of a very sizeable amount at
the present time, I believe.
I repeat: in the first place, we do not want
to affect the interests of the depositors; in
the next place, this money should be retained
for the benefit of mercantile business and
the maintenance of employment.
For these reasons I personally am opposed
to this bill, lock, stock and barrel. I cannot
see in it one item of merit; I can see only
trouble-trouble-trouble for everybody connected with it; and I plead with the government to be content with existing legislation.
I concede that the life insurance companies
have done a magnificent job, but they are
getting near to the limit of the amount they
judge it advisable to put into mortgages, so
that they are transferring their interest to
bonds. I observe that bonds of the Province
of Manitoba which were issued to yield 4
per cent now bring a price which yields only
3.61 per cent. Bonds offered by the Canadian
National Railways in January this year, and
which, at the issue price of 99k, gave a
return of 3a per cent, are now selling at
around 104. Why? Because the insurance
companies are in the market to build up their
portfolios with more bonds and fewer mortgages. I admit that in the mortgage field the
insurance companies have done well; in fact
they have lent on this type of security in
excess of the limits formerly permitted by
the law. I am not an insurance company
director, but my recollection, which may be
corrected by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) or the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is
that these companies may allocate only 15
per cent of their reserves to this type of
security. Under the present bill this limitation no longer holds; but the fact remains
that, in the opinion of the companies, the
danger point has been reached.
The other change affects the banks. I
deplore what seems to me an attack on

MARCH 16, 1954
the banks. I regret to see a drawing away
of resources represented by a combination of
small savings; and it is to be remembered
that most savings accounts are small, because
usually, when they grow bigger, the money
is put into bonds. Three months ago I asked
a nurse, "What do you do with the money
which you save?". She said "I put it in the
bank until I have enough to provide a reserve in case I am sick". I said "Yes; and
then what?". "Then", she said, "when I have
saved another $100 I ask the bank manager
what bond he would recommend me to buy,
and he tells me, and I buy it." But she
keeps a certain amount in the bank for emergencies. Now, the banks are to lend that
emergency money. I think-taking the case
in point-the young woman should do the
lending of her own money. If she wants to
invest it in a bond, let ber do so; if she
wants to purchase a mortgage company bond,
she should have the right to buy it; if she
prefers the bonds of some life insurance
company, and such securities are available,
let the choice be hers, not that of someone
else.
So, I repeat, I am opposed to this legislation.
It does not meet the need it is supposed to
meet, and it permits the taking of money
from a source which should not be tampered
with at all.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt:
Honourable
senators, if I agreed with the arguments of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), and were forced to oppose
the bill, I would be in a very pessimistic
frame of mind. But for myself, I approve
the bill, and am ready to vote for it. I do
not deny that the honourable senator who
has just spoken has had some experience in
these matters, but we in Quebec, with our
local organization, the caisse populaire, have
had fifty-four years' experience. I might
also point out that my honourable colleague
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who
is connected with savings banks in Quebec,
has had some experience with mortgages in
the last six or seven years. He has no
apprehensions about this legislation; neither
have I.
The honourable senator who has just taken
his seat mentioned, I believe, that as far
back as 1867 banks were prohibited from
lending money on mortgages. But the situation has changed. Our caisses populaires
in Quebec have now over $130 million loaned
on mortgages. Formerly, when a mortgage
was arranged, the mortgagee was required
to refund annually a certain sum of money.
For example, on a loan of $1,000 the repayment might be $100 plus interest, payable
once a year. But the system has changed.

The borrower is required to refund each
month a certain amount, and, because
thousands of people who borrow money to
build houses are repaying month by month
sums running into millions of dollars, that
money is no longer held in certain hands for
twelve months, but circulates continuously
through the agency of the banks. I am happy
to be able to publicize these facts, because
it was Mr. Desjardins, the founder of the
caisse populaire, who first organized the
system of refunding money each month. I
belleve that this method is largely responsible
for the fact that, although our local organizations have had fifty-four years' operations
in receiving savings and loaning money, and
have advanced over $1 billion by way of
mortgages, our losses have amounted to no
more than one-hundredth of one per cent.
I do not fear the results of the entry of the
banks into the mortgage field, because the
large amounts received by the banks are
derived, not from poor people but from the
workers, and it is reasonable that a certain
amount of this money shall be available,
not only for business expansion, but for the
ordinary needs of the local population.
It is said that this law is not perfect. I
agree. It is not perfect because people are
not perfect, and imperfect people cannot
make perfect legislation. The purpose of
this bill is to assist a great number of lowsalaried citizens to own their own homes,
and it is for this reason that I approve the
legislation.
I feel that this legislation can be improved,
and I hope that it will be improved while in
committee. For instance, I hope that the
clause which entitles limited-dividend housing
companies to derive certain benefits, when
they are erecting multiple-family dwellings,
will be amended in favour of housing cooperatives. We are told that certain people
will never own their own homes, that they
are not called upon to fulfil this social role.
This may be so. for some people have never
owned anything. But if people were offered
the opportunity of owning a small piece tof
land, no matter how small, I am sure their
whole way of life would be altered. I have
some experience in this matter, for during a
period of over forty years I have been dealing with caisses populaires and such charitable organizations as the St. Vincent de Paul
Society.
I could cite cases where poor familles of
eight, eleven and even thirteen children have
been evicted from bouses because the rent
had not been paid for several months. Charitable organizations were eventually able to
place these families in bouses that had been
more or less poorly maintained, but within
a few weeks these people put in gardens and

SENATE
generally improved their newly-acquired
dwellings. They had been given a small
piece of property, and the fact of owning
something had altered their whole pattern
of life; practically overnight they no longer
required assistance. Some of these families,
after requiring charitable aid for as long as
ten to twenty years, no longer needed it, and
their descendants are now living happily in
their own homes.
On the other hand, I also know people who
have always lived in apartment dwellings
that have housed as many as eight, ten or
twelve tenants. They have been paying
monthly rents of $20 and $25, and they will
probably never get away frorn this sort of
thing. I have noticed that it is in such
homes that the most subversive and detrimental notions are born and bred. I do not claim
that this is true of all low-rental dwellings,
but it applies to many. For this and other
reasons we should endeavour to the utmost
to develop a sense of ownership in our people.
It has been claimed that only one organization should be considered in the matter of
constructing multiple dwellings, for one could
not be given preferred treatment over
another. If a limited-dividend housing company can be given preferred treatment, then
why can the same method not be applied in
the matter of housing co-operatives, which
have done wonderful work in the past with
respect to moral and social education as well
as in the field of house building? I am dumbfounded to realize that some people can
think right in matters concerning dollars and
cents, but cannot use the same sense of logic
when dealing with the moral values which
form the basis of the life of every nation.
A country that has no sense of moral values
is headed for material and physical ruination
and total degeneration.
I should like to make a few comments in
order to refute certain rumours which were
spread around the country, no doubt to prevent the passage of this bill. For instance,
it has been said that under this act no house
can be built for less than $12,000. When the
10 per cent and the 30 per cent have been
deducted, the sum of $10,000 remains to be
paid. This amount is to be amortized over a
period of twenty-five years at an interest
rate of 51 per cent. On this basis the home
owner would have to pay $61.41 per month,
and with taxes and fire insurance taken into
consideration the monthly payment would be
increased to approximately $70. If this were
the case, the act could never be applied, for
ordinary employees could never afford the
initial cash requirement of $2,000, and maintain monthly payments of $70. The Montreal
Star, under date of March 13, carried an
advertisement about houses approved by the

Central Housing and Mortgage Corporation,
and selling for $8,500. Some of the building
features of these homes were as follows: full
concrete basement; hardwood floors; coloured
line tile bathroom with showers; 200 volt
wiring for electric stove; living room with
picture window; steel columns; planned
kitchen with linoleum; three bedrooms;
ample closet space and hot air heating.
Let us apply the new mortgage financing
to this advertised home costing $8,500. After
10 per cent is deducted from the first $8,000,
and 30 per cent from the balance of $500,
an amount of $7,550 will still remain to be
paid. This amount will be amortized over
a period of twenty-five years at a monthly
rate of $46.08. Added to this will be the cost
of fire insurance and the payment of taxes,
making an aggregate outlay of approximately
$52 or $53 a rnonth. Thus the plan becomes
quite feasible. These particular houses are
built near Montreal, where land is quite
expensive, and it will be realized that the
people who build them make a living from
it. Housing co-operatives at Drummondville,
Quebec City and Cap de la Madeleine have
been building seven-roomed houses designed
with eight-foot cellars. They are finished
with a brick veneer and sell for only $7,000.
Last year in Quebec City we built a number
of houses by way of experiment, one being
finished with asbestos shingles, and we sold
these homes for $6,011.25. I must admit that
this particular type of house did not meet
the requirements of the Central Housing and
Mortgage Corporation, as it did not have an
entrance hall. To include such an entrance
hall would have meant increasing the dimensions of the house by three feet in width

the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation will introduce regulations te enable lowsalaried workers to occupy houses that do
not have entrance halls. I do not see any
particular reason why a house should have
an entrance hall. However, the officials who
administer this act are reasonable persons,
and I do not doubt that they will establish
fair regulations.

there are over 60 housing co-operatives,
which represent more than 50 per cent of

large number of housing co-operatives is the
result of financing which, in most cases, was
done by the savings and credit co-operatives.
I hope that this law will be applied successfully to the welfare of our compatriots,
and that the regulations enacted thereunder
will facilitate the application of the law.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
when the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) explained this
bill yesterday I understood there would be
no opposition to it whatsoever. In fact, I
thought that if I had an opportunity to say a
few words, my very first would be to congratulate him on the very clear and full
manner in which he outlined the various
sections. It is true that he did not cover
every section. For instance, I do not think he
referred to section 43, a very important section dealing with proclamation of the various
parts of the act. However, I was impressed
by the general object of the bill, and, naturally, was surprised to hear so learned a
person as the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) say he was
opposed to the bill.
I have an altogether different approach.
I think the bill is an exceptionally fine social
measure. If no other purpose is to be served,
it will certainly be instrumental in creating
a finer type of citizen in Canada. I was very
surprised at a statement made by the Leader
of the Opposition in regard to the exhaustion
of the market. Surely he must realize that the
market is far from being exhausted, for since
the middle of 1945, about eight years ago,
730,000 homes have been built, an average of
91,000 houses a year, and last year a top
record of 105,000 houses were started. Those
facts speak well for a piece of legislation such
as we have before us.
The other day when I asked the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) whether he proposed referring the
bill to a standing committee or dealing with
it in committee of the whole, I had in mind
that we might have an opportunity for a
fuller discussion in committee of the whole
than in a standing committee. As I am not
fortunate enough to be a member of the
Banking and Commerce committee to which
the Leader of the Government intimated the
bill would be sent, I should like to bring to
the attention of the chairman of the committee and its nembers one or two matters that
I think should be enlarged upon or clarified.
I have in mind, for instance, the very fine
work done by the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation in regard to the housing
situation in Canada during the past several
years. However, I feel that they have still
83280-24

left untapped a potential market, that of the
lower-bracket wage-earner. As far as I have
been able to ascertain, the bill contains no
provisions for the benefit of the low wageearner, that is, the type of man who can pay
from $32.50 to $45.00 per month. I think
that is an oversight, because people in this
class represent a big, potential market which
has been practically untapped during the
building program of post-war years, and
indeed since the National Housing Act first
came into effect.
The Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation throughout its years of service has
done a really good job in the other fields of
housing; and I believe that house builders
in every section of Canada will find the lower
wage-earner group ready and anxious to pay
for their own homes, through a proper plan
which can be worked out by the corporation.
I mention this because I realize, naturally,
that plans and specifications for a $6,500
home are not adequate to provide for a
$9,500, $10,000 or $12,000 home; and I think
that if necessary serious consideration should
be given to the needs of those very important
groups known as the lower or middle-class
wage-earners. One must consider that while
the average annual earnings of the classes to
which I refer have practically doubled in the
post-war era, their expenditures have grown
out of proportion to their earnings. Unfortunately, the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation has, to a marked degree, devoted
its attention to what one might term the
middle and upper classes, no doubt thinking
this was a safer or more profitable policy.
Department stores do not depend on one
class for merchandising, but reach out to all
classes, and in the great majority of cases
mass production is brought about by the
heavy buying of the middle and lower income
groups. So I repeat, these groups are very
definitely a potential market for the builder.
I wish to say a word in regard to the
statement of the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) as to the attitude of the
banks. I am one of those who feel that the
banks are quite prepared to accept their
responsibility on this important question. If
they are provided with the proper machinery
and are given permission to go ahead, I do
not think they will hesitate to make the loans
necessary to provide funds for the building
of additional homes. The question in my
mind is whether the Bank Act should have
been amended before this plan was brought
in and the banks asked to co-operate in it. If
the proper amendment were made to the
Bank Act, I am confident that the banks
would carry on in the same fine way as the
insurance companies have throughout the
past several years. Great credit is due the

SENATE
insurance companies for the progress they
have made, and the fine record they have
shown. The relatively few losses suffered by
these companies gives me real pride in the
citizens of Canada.
I mentioned earlier that this legislation is
of a social nature. In this connection I should
like to refer to a recent news item on what
President Eisenhower had to say about the
need for new housing in the United States,
and the fact that his housing program was
of a social and welfare nature. We in Canada, by the adoption of this legislation, will
follow very closely the program in the
United States: while we are now spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on national
health and welfare, we are turning to another
branch of welfare, that of housing. When
placing his housing plan before Congress,
President Eisenhower said:
I submit herewith measures designed to promote
the efforts of our people to acquire good homes, and
to assist our communities to develop wholesome
neighbourhoods in which families may live and
prosper.

I think that is what our Minister of Public
Works-that fine Nova Scotian, the Honourable Mr. Winters-is endeavouring to do by
this legislation; in other words, to make it
possible for all classes to enjoy better home
life. I certainly agree with the definitions
of home life given by the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
As long as our people have a happy family
life they will be good citizens.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But 6 per cent interest
on mortgages is a bit too high.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not think we can
measure in dollars and cents the extent to
which we should go in providing good homes
for the development of family life.
President Eisenhower continued:
The development of conditions under which every
family can obtain good housing is a major objective of national policy. It is important for two
reasons:
First: good housing in good neighbourhoods is
necessary for good citizenship and good health
among our people.
Second: a high level of housing construction and
vigorous community development are essential te
the economic and social well-being of our country.
It is, therefore, properly a concern of this government to ensure that opportunities are provided
every family te acquire a good home.

I should like to take my place alongside
the Honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) as one who wholeheartedly approves the general principle of
this legislation. I hope that I may have a
further opportunity to ask one or two questions of a pointed nature on some sections
of the bill. In closing, may I ask the honourable leader if when the bill is reported

back to the house we shall have an opportunity of discussing any particular sections.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Why, certainly we shall.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
after listening to the speech of the Honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I
felt I should like to say a few words about
the bill. While I enjoyed his speech-and
some of the things he said were, I think,
salutary-I do not agree that his method
would be the proper one to meet the housing
problem at this time. I listened to the
explanation of the bill by the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) last
evening, and although I had not at that time
read the bill I felt that he gave a splendid
explanation. I now feel it is a most comprehensive bill, and one which meets a need
that is apparent in Canada.
When this bill was being voted on in the
other house, I went to the gallery with some
friends and had the unique experience of
hearing the Speaker of that bouse call for
yeas and nays. There were the usual yeas
and nays audibleHon. Mr. Quinn: Mr. Speaker, on a point
of order, may I point out that the honourable
senator is referring to what transpired in
the other place at the present session. I
contend that he is out of order.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I feel, Mr. Speaker, that
I am perfectly in order.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: The honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) is familiar with the rules of this
house, and I am quite sure he will take care
not to encroach upon them.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I will not encroach upon
the rules of the house.
A standing vote was then demanded. They
had to stand and be recorded, and everybody
voted for the bill exceptHon. Mr. Quinn: Mr. Speaker, my friend
is still endeavouring to state what took place
in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Everybody except two
voted for the bill. I thought it was the best
piece of parliamentary strategy I had seen
in many a day, and I am very sure that it
resulted in a sharp rise in the stock of the
Minister of Public Works, who had charge
of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, it
seems to me that this bill is a successful
effort to meet existing conditions and provide the means whereby certain people of
this country can get necessary housing accommodation. First, it is a marshalling of the

MARCH 16, 1954
capital money in this country. We ail know
that the repositories of our wealth are the
banks and life insurance and finance companies, and this bill gives the people access
to them. Down in my part of the country
there is an old saying to the effect that if
you want money you must go where the
money is. I think that is exactly what this
bill does: it gives those institutions which control the pools of money an opportunity to
use it for the mutual advantage of these institutions and the public.
The bill provides that the cost of the money
to the borrower will be very carefully controlled. It is based on the rate of return
on victory bonds, to which is added the
normal expense in an operation of this kind,
and the interest rate is fixed as low as
possible, considering conditions as they exist
today.
There is the added advantage of having
loans amortized over a period of twenty-five
years. This is a good proposition for the man
who expects and hopes to own a home in his
lifetime. There is the further advantage of
having the cost of insurance borne collectively. The companies which control finances
are powerful and can get money at the lowest
possible rate. I am not altogether sure that I
like the idea of a government guarantee, for
the banks in this country have always been
exponents of free enterprise. It surprises me
a little that they would like to do business
under the shadow of a government guarantee.
However, the government guarantee in this
case has the effect of lowering the rate of
interest. We are told that a good interest
rate on money is 3 per cent. The extra
percentage is charged because of the hazard.
When the hazard is removed we can expect
lower interest rates.
Certain elements which enter into this are
of value according to their virtue and the
impression they can make. I am one of those
who do not believe the big institutions of
this country should be given too much shelter.
However, we will have an opportunity to
discuss that when the Bank Act comes before
us this session.
The banks at present are in quite an affluent position. Never in history have they made
so much profit as they are making at the
present time. In the past the life insurance
companies have taken their share of mortgage lending, and now we are asking the
banks to participate in this business. The
bill only asks that the banks take a reasonable share by lending some of their surplus
money to be used for a needy purpose, and
for the public benefit. The banks, I am sure,
can lend money on housing without jeopardizing the savings of the people. Time and
83280-24J

again we are told that the function of banks
is merely to accept savings and look after
them. Although some assert that that is an
absolute fallacy, I would not go that far.
However, I do say that to a large degree
it is a fallacy. It is my opinion that the
function of banking institutions today, with
the enormous funds at their disposal, is not
limited to looking atter people's savings. However, we can explore that subject when the
Bank Act is being considered.
I am glad to see that the primary producers, such as the fisherman, the logger and
the lumberman, are going to benefit under
this Act. I would like to see more done
for the farmers. What strikes me when I
go into the country is the simplicity of the
farmers' homes. In general, the farmer has
not the domestic conveniences that we have
in the towns. Some farm homes have a
bathroom and some have a central heating
system, but generally the standard of living,
so far as housing is concerned, is not in line
with that of industrial parts of the country;
and I think, therefore, that in the future we
should do something in this regard. As a rule
financial institutions are not fussy about
lending on real estate to residents of a rural
area, because, I suppose, of the greater difficulty of disposing of real estate in the country
than in the more active market of an urban
district.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) yesterday spoke of taxes.
I would point out under this legislation
taxes are included in the monthly payments
by the home owner, and when the lending
institution pays the taxes it should get the
advantage of the discount of perhaps 4 per
cent or 5 per cent allowed by municipalities
for prompt payment, and pass it on to the
home owner.
The principle of this legislation is in keeping with the present-day trend, to mortgage
the future. My attention was drawn only
today to an advertisement for television sets
at $10 down and so much a month for many
months. Honourable senators will remember that some years ago we had to place
restrictions on credit buying in Canada and
require a 20 or 30 per cent down payment
on articles purchased. It was found necessary
to put on some arbitrary restrictions to prevent people from going too deeply into debt
through credit buying. I read recently that
a company was offering for sale, without any
down payment, a refrigerator plus a month's
supply of provisions. It is not so extraordinary as it looks, because the refrigerator
is only a factor in the transaction. Companies
like that make their profits through the
financing of the products they sell.

SENATE
Of course, the expense of borrowing money
is high. When you finance the purchase of
an automobile at so much down and so much
a month you pay plenty for it. The man who
buys for cash and gets a discount is the
one who benefits. People who buy something
for a low down payment forget about the
high finance charges that they are going to
pay on the balance for years to come, but
they do rush into these deals. Furthermore,
they usually do not have full knowledge of
the ultimate price they are paying. It is
through their charges for money that the
companies who sell on these terms succeed. Do
not forget that 10 per cent interest on the
money involved in the transaction will
probably exceed the profit on the refrigerator,
and as the years go by the company is likely
to sell the customer many other articles on
the same basis. It is a business that should
be carefully scrutinized by those who do the
buying. Our economy is something like a
bicycle: it bas to be kept going to stand up.
it must be kept rolling along. When a man
goes into debt to buy a house he is doing a
salutary thing, because he is putting his
savings in the house instead of putting them
in the bank, and he saves rental charges and
eventually becomes the unencumbered owner.
Besides, the ownership of a house gives a
man a feeling of independence and stability.
The more people in this country who become
home owners, the greater will be the number
of our independent and stable citizens. A
home is an anchor. In my small concern and
in my business relations I have always cooperated with the desires of any dependable
workman who came to our company and
asked to borrow money to build a house. I
knew that if he built a house be would not
be carried away by every little whim to seek
greener looking fields elsewhere.
There are safeguards all around this legislation-safeguards as to the amount of money
the bank can lend, as to how expensive a
house one can buy, how much one should
pay, and other safeguards to protect the buyer
against exploitation. As it has been said,
no legislation is perfect; but legislation of
this kind, dealing as it does with a human
problem, will provide facilities of great benefit
to the people. With the five-day week coming along a workman has more time to improve his property. Many men can and do
spend their spare time on Saturdays and on
evenings throughout the week in helping to
build their own bouses. A company with
which I was connected bas been lending
money to some of its employees to enable
them to build houses; and there bas not been
one default over the years. Here is the way
it works. A man who owns a plot of ground

will get the help of friends to dig his cellar:
somewhere in the plant is a plumber who
will undertake to do the plumbing in his
spare time; perhaps there is an electrician
who, in the same way, will look after the
electrical work. All these men help one
another; and when the house is built the cost
to the owner is much less than you might
suppose.
That kind of enterprise should be
encouraged. A man's family may include a
couple of boys who are living at home and
can help both with physical labour and money
contributions. Where the family is large,
and growing, and remains together, it can
give a great deal of assistance in building
and paying for the home. The honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said, as I understood him, that a man with
an income of $4,000 could not afford to build

a $10,000 house.

But right in our own

community and in our own plant are men
who have done that very thing,-men to
whom we have made loans. We do not
care to advance more than 60 per cent of
the full value, but on that basis our employees
have borrowed money and repaid it, and
have got homes, good homes. I think that is
a splendid achievement. It means that they
have a purpose and are carrying it out, and
that makes for conditions generally which are
good for the community. Have homes been
built by men with $4,000 a year? Yes, and
$8,000 homes have been built from incomes
of $3,000 a year. But much of the construction was done by the owners themselves,
and of course that helps out considerably.
Before this bill came here it received almost
unanimous assent in the other place. I
believe it is to be sent to our Committee on
Banking and Commerce, and I am sure that
when it is considered there it will have the
careful attention which measures of this kind
always have in that committee. It may be
that when it is returned to the Senate the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) will change his mind, and, like
his friends in the other place, will vote for
the bill, so that it may be passed unanimously.

agree that this bill is a step in the right
direction, and that, as better housing will
make a better country, it is along this path
that we should go. That can be taken for
granted. But I want to point out that the

opportunity.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No, you are correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
leader opposite seems to take the stand that
a person without any financial means whatever will be able to build a home under this
legislation, but that is not so. The act provides that 90 per cent of the first $8,000 of
the lending value of each house or any part
thereof may be advanced, and 70 per cent
of the remainder. A person building under
the act must make an initial down payment,
and this means that he will immediately
have a considerable investment in the home.
The Leader of the Opposition also assumes
that young married couples who perhaps
have not yet bought their furniture will be
the only people to take advantage of the act.
They can take advantage of it, of course, but
only if they can make the initial down payment. Many Canadians who have been married for years, some of whom have already
raised their families, want to own their own
homes, and if they can make the down payment they will be able to build under this
legislation.
The suggestion was made, again by the
leader opposite, that there is no further
demand for this type of housing, that the
demand has been exhausted. Well, as the
honourable gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) stated, over 100,000
units were disposed of last year. So the
demand has not disappeared. Marriages are
taking place at the rate of about 125,000 a
year, and approximately 30,000 married
women immigrants come into Canada
annually. It is estimated that after deaths,
dissolutions of marriage and emigration, the
net annual increase of family formations in
Surely this is
Canada is about 95,000.
evidence that the demand for this type of
housing has not yet been exhausted.
It is true, as has been pointed out, that
life insurance companies have been providing most of these loans in the past, and thesc
companies deserve great credit for what they
have done. However, when the president of
the Dominion Mortgage and Investment
Association appeared before the Banking and
Commerce Committee of the House of Commons he confirmed the doubt that life insurance companies can do no more than they
are doing at the present time in the new
residential housing field. There is no other
source, unless it is the private investor, and,
as I pointed out yesterday, the private
investor will not go beyond 50 or 60 per cent.
So where has the government turned? It
has proposed that the Bank Act be amended
to enable banks to invest funds on deposit
in these mortgages. The mortgages will be

insured, so the banks will be taking no
chance. When they get an insured mortgage
it will be as good as a government bond.
Are the savings of Canadian citizens being
put out at an undue risk? Surely there is
no better security obtainable than the backing of the dominion government. As I have
said, any mortgage placed by the bank on
property built under this act will be as good
as a government bond, and the security
which the depositor gets could not be better.
The Leader of the Opposition said that no
funds would be available for mercantile purposes, but that is contrary to the evidence
given before the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the other house. The Governor of the Bank of Canada stated that in his
opinion the banks could invest $100 million
annually in this type of mortgage, without
taking any funds which would otherwise go
into mercantile investments and other
ordinary bank loans. No one is going to be
harmed. The banks are going to have mortgages which they can take to the Bank of
Canada, and obtain loans on them, if the
bank sees fit. The bank could sell them to
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Surely this whole proposition is a
good thing for the depositors as well as for
the banks.
I shall make just one more reference to
what has been said by the Leader of the
Opposition. The only conclusion I could draw
from bis remarks is that he wants the Canadian people to live in rented homes; that the
provinces and municipalities should build
homes for rental purposes. I do not know
what rent he proposes, but he did refer to
a rental of $75 a month that was being paid
in certain parts of Winnipeg. Does he want
the people of Winnipeg and other Canadian
centres to continue paying $75 a month in
rent and never become the owners of the
homes in which they are living? That is
not the policy of this government, and I am
sure it would not meet with the approval of
honourable senators. The policy of the government, which I hope will get the support
of this house, is to provide the people of
Canada with an opportunity to become home
owners, not renters of homes all their lives.
That is the policy which this bill will make
effective.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

very simple one. The incorporation of a
company called Trans-Canada Pipe Lines
appears in the Statutes of Canada, 1951,
chapter 92. Since incorporation, the building
of an all-Canadian gas pipe line has undoubtedly called forth the imagination of all Canadians. It is, I believe, the biggest project
launched in Canada since the building of the
Canadian Pacific and other trans-continental
railways. It is of great national importance,
and when completed will provide large and
important areas of Canada with energy and
power for expansion. A few days ago the
Right Honourable Mr. Howe stated in the
House of Commons that a billion dollars
would be expended on this project within the
next five or six years. Up to the beginning of
1954 divergent opinions prevailed between
the federal and provincial authorities, and
also, between the companies, which had different projects in view. At last, the companies
accepted suggestions made by the dominion
government and also by the government of
Alberta, and agreed to join in their efforts
for the transmission of natural gas, and this
met with the approval of all parties concerned. Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Limited
will undertake the project, and it will be the
biggest of its kind ever developed in Canada.
It is the purpose of the present bill to
enable the company to carry out this very
great project. I do not propose to go into
the details of the bill; that will be done in
committee. I intend to deal with the principle of the bill only. I think it is sufficient
to say that there are three important features.
First, the bill is purely financial in principle,
its purpose being to increase the capital
stock of the company from five million shares
of the par value of one dollar per share
to ten million common shares of the par
value of one dollar per share. That is the
first amendment. Secondly, the bill provides
for the isue of one million preferred shares
of the par value of fifty dollars per share.
Thirdly, it provides that no issue of the
preferred shares shall be made until first
approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. These are the only
features which appear in the bill. Further
details will be given by representatives of
the company when the bill goes to committee.
It is a great honour for me to present this
bill, and I am sure honourable senators are

much interested in this project of national
importance. If the bill is given second reading I shall move that it be referred to the
Transport and Communications committee,
where it can be considered in detail.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend if he has any information regarding the possible cost to the consumers of
natural gas to whom this pipe line will convey
the product from Alberta, and also what the
distributing cost is likely to be in the larger
markets here in the east, such as the cities of
Toronto and Montreal, where the line is supposed to be directed?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I certainly would not
venture to say what the cost of the gas would
be to the different corporations using it. Of
course, the cost would differ, depending on
the location. It would undoubtedly be less
in Saskatchewan or Manitoba than in Toronto,
Montreal, or elsewhere in Quebec. In the
second place, much will depend on the cost
of the line, and since construction will not
be completed for a few years the total cost
could only be determined at that time.
As to the cost of financing, I think that
will have to be assessed while the work is
in progress. And finally, a great deal will
of course depend upon the size of the market.
If the cost of transportation is shared on
the basis of 3 million cubic feet of gas per
day, it will obviously be more than if it is
shared on a 5 million cubic foot operation.
I am not an expert in these matters, but
I offer these thoughts as a reasonable
explanation of the situation. It is impossible
for me to give further details about cost,
but my honourable friend will recall the
discussion which took place recently in the
House of Commons when the Niagara Gas
Transmission bill was considered. I believe
there was at that time an understanding that
the Niagara project which will supply
southern gas to Toronto and vicinity will
convert to western gas as soon as it is available. I conclude from that that the Consumers' Gas Company, which has a big
interest in the Niagara line, does not feel that
the people from Toronto will find gas from
the southern states more costly than western
gas. Otherwise, it would not have agreed
to such a proposition.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask a further
question, purely as a matter of enlightenment? I assume that by passing this bill
we would merely be amending the company's
act of incorporation.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is all.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Later on the company
would have to apply to the Board of Transport Commissioners for a permit to operate,

NORTH AMERICAN BAPTISTS OF CANADAREPORT OF COMMITTEE-AMENDMENTS
CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. Bouffard, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
presented the report of the committee on
Bill G-11.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to make a brief announcement for the information of honourable members who desire to greet the Right Honourable
the Prime Minister when he arrives back
at Rockcliffe Airport at 9.30 tonight. Those
going to the airport by car should proceed by Sussex street through Rockcliffe park
and north of the lake along the Driveway to
the R.C.M.P. barracks, from which point there
will be guides. This route, rather than the
one by the Montreal road, is recommended.
It is important that all who are motoring
to the airport should reach there and have
their cars parked by 9 p.m. or earlier. For
those not using their cars, it has been arranged that three buses will leave from in
front of the Parliament Buildings at 8.45 p.m.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTE TO IRELAND'S PATRON SAINT

Hon. FeUx P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
may I remind the house that this is the
17th of March, the day when all Irishmen
commemorate not the birth but the death
of that illustrious apostle of Ireland, St.
Patrick. Historians and writers have disagreed as to where St. Patrick was born.
Many claim that his birthplace was Dumbarton, Scotland, while others say he was born
in Wales, and still others say it was in
France. But I think the majority of the
claims are that he was born in Dumbarton,
Scotland. So we must give Seotland some
credit for our illustrious Saint.
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: He was born and reared
a Christian until he was sixteen years of

SENATE
age, when hie was captured by a band of
Irish raiders and taken into captivity to
Ireland and sold to an Irish chieftain who
raised sheep. Patrick was given the task of
taking care of the sheep, and hie laboured as
a sheep herder for six years, praying incessantly that God would release hlmi frorn
captivity. At the end of the six years he
made his escape, crossed the channel and
landed in Wales, which fact probably gave
rise to the dlaim that he was born in that
country. He then crossed the channel ta
France, made Nis way to Tours, and placed
himself under the protection of the Bishop
of that see, by whomn he was educated and
elevated to the priesthood. He laboured there
for a while and then made his way to Rome,
where hie pleaded with the papal authorities
over and over again ta be allowed ta go
back ta the land that hie had learned ta love
during the six years of his captivity.
It is told that hie saw in a vision and heard
the voices of unborn children crying, "Corne
back, O holy youth, and bring us the gospel
of truth." Whether that is true or not, he
finally succeeded in abtaining a commission
and was consecrated a bishop. Then, accompanied by a small band of missionaries, he
made his way back ta Ireland, crassed over,
we are told, and made his way ta a bill
opposite the hili of Tara, which was the seat
of the kings of that day. The people of
Ireland were pagans at that time, and they
worshipped idols under the arch-Druids and
Druids, and by a strange coincidence Patrick
reached the bill on the eve of their great
annual celebratian. An edict had gone out
that no fire was ta be lighted on the day of
celebratian until the arch-Druid first lighted
his beacon on the hill of Tara. When Patrick
and his littie band arrived on the opposite
hili they lay down on the green, for they
had no shelter, and awakened before daylight, and immediately praceeded ta light
a fire. This was observed frorn the opposite
hifl. The Court was alarmed, and gazed in
horror at thîs fire on the opposite bilh. A
traop of soldiers was sent ta arrest the
culprits, and Patrick and bis little band were
taken and braught before the Royal Court,
where it was demanded of himi that hie
explain bis canduct. He immediately broke
forth and told themn that there was only one
God, the Creator and Sovereign Lord of
heaven and earth and of ahi things; hie told
them how that God consisted of three divine
persans, the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit, and how the Father had sent the Son
ta assume human form and suifer and die
on the Cross for the sins of the worhd. They
listened in rapt attention, but were unable
ta grasp the idea that there could possibly
be Three in One. Patrick used ail bis oratori-

cal and persuasive ability without success,
and almost in despair bie dropped his eyes.
There at bis feet hie bebeld the little sharnrock. He stooped, plucked it, held it up and
said "O King, nature bas corne ta my aid;
in this simple forrn it is shown bow it is
passible ta have Tbree in One.
They bade birn go on preaching; and hie
continued until finally hie bad converted,
baptized and Christianized the whole nation
af Ireland.
Is it any wander that Irish men and wornen
throughout the warld love and revere that
dear littie shamrock, the emblem of their
faitb and o! their country? Or that on this
day, when every Irish man and woman
thraughout the world goes ta divine worsbip
in the early part o! the day, they reverence
their behoved St. Patrick? In many places
today the Irish will bold parades, celebrations, banquets and festivities of ail kinds,
and tbey will look witb loving eyes back ta
the land of their forefathers. They will tell
the story of the exile who, returning after
many years, looked frorn the deck of bis
ship towards Ireland and, seeing the first
glimpse of it in the early morning, raised his
voice and said:
0O' Ireland, isn't it grand you look,
With the Sun your hili-tops adornin'.
With ail the pent-up love in me heart
I bld ye the top of the mornin'

Yes, and at gatherings they will sing of
the glanies of Brian the Brave:
Let Erin remember the days of old
'Ere her faithiess sons betrayed her
When Malachy wore the collar of gold
Which ha won fromn the proud invader;
When her kings, with standards of green unfurled,
Led the Red branch knights to danger,
'Ere the emerald gem of the western world
Was set in the crown of a stranger.

Stili others will sing Aileen Allanah,
Kathleen Mavaurneen, Wait for Me at
Heaven's Gate, Sweet Belle Mahone, and
Dublin's Bay; they will sing of the mountains
of Mourne that look down to the sea, and
Danny Boy ta the Londonderry Air; they
will sing Galway Bay, and:
With deep affection
And recollection
I often think of
Those Shandon bells:
Whose sounds so wild would
In days of childhood
Fiing 'round my cradie
Their magic speils.
On this I ponder
Where'er I wander,
And thus grow fonder,
Sweet Cork, of thee:
With thy bells of Shandon,
That sound so grand on
The picasant waters
0f the river Lee.

MARCH 17, 1954
Again the thoughts of Irish men and
women will go back to that beautiful vale
which gave inspiration to the immortal bard,
Thomas Moore, who penned the lines:
There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters
meet;
Oh! the last rays of feeling, and life must depart,
'Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my
heart.
Sweet vale of Avocal how calm could I rest
In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I love best,
Where the storm clouds we feel in this cold world
should cease,
And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in
peace.

Others still will look back and think of
the Lakes of Killarney:
Where angels fold their wings and rest
In that Eden of the blest,
Beauty's home, Killarney.

As Irishmen and women throughout the
world celebrate today the feast of their
patron saint, they will, I am sure, take great
pride in telling the story of how Ireland got
its name. If I may have the indulgence of
the house, I will try to put the story to music.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: This is how it goes:
Have you ever heard the story of how Ireland got
its name?
If you listen you will understand from whence old
Ireland came.
No wonder that we love that dear old land beyond
the ses,
For here's the way my dear old mother told the
tale to me.
Sure a little bit of heaven fell from out the sky
one day,
And nestled on the ocean in a spot so far away;
And when the angels found it, sure it looked so
sweet and fair,
They said suppose we leave it, for it looks so
peaceful there.
Then they sprinkled it with stardust, just to make
the shamrocks grow;
'Tis the only place you'll find them, no matter
where you go.
Then they dotted it with silver to make its lakes
so grand,
And when they had it finished, sure they called it
Ireland.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

TRADE AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
REPORT ON FIRST MEETING OF JOINT UNITED
STATES-CANADIAN COMMITTEE

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the business of the house is proceeded
with I would like to ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if he has any statement to make
regarding the very important conference
which was held this last week, in the city
of Washington, between representatives of
the Governments of Canada and the United
States.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have a copy of the joint statement
which was made by representatives of both
governments. I could put it on Hansard, or
I could read it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it should be read.
It is not very long.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will read the statement. Following is the text of a joint communique issued simultaneously in Ottawa
by the Department of External Affairs and
in Washington by the United States Department of State:
The first meeting of the Joint United States-Canadian Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs was
held in Washington on the 16th of March. The
United States was represented by: Hon. John Foster
Dulles, Secretary of State; Hon. George M. Humphrey, Secretary of the Treasury; Hon. Ezra Taft
Benson, Secretary of Agriculture; Hon. Sinclair
Weeks, Secretary of Commerce.
Canada was represented by: Rt. Hon. C. D. Howe,
M.P., Minister of Trade and Commerce, and Defence
Production; Rt. Hon. James Garfield Gardiner, M.P.,
Minister of Agriculture; Hon. Douglas Charles
Abbott, M.P., Minister of Finance; Hon. L. B.
Pearson, M.P., Secretary of State for External
Affairs.
In addition to the members of the Joint Committee, Governor Adams, the Assistant to the
President, the Honourable Douglas Stuart, United
States Ambassador to Canada, and Dr. Gabriel
Hague, Economic Assistant to the President, participated in the discussions.
The purpose of the meeting was to provide an
opportunity for United States and Canadian ministers to examine the trade and economic problems
that are common to both countries.
The ministers noted that the flow of trade between
Canada and the United States is greater than that
between any other two countries. They discussed
various aspects of present trade relations, and

agreed on the desirability of avoiding any action
which would interfere with this trade from which
the two countries derive such great benefits.
Since the common economic problems of Canada
and the United States can be solved with greatest
success in a world where the volume of trade is
steady and increasing and where exchange arrangements are of a kind to facilitate such growth, consideration was given throughout the discussions to
the need for action towards freer trade and payments on a broad front. It was agreed that few
things would contribute more to the well-being
and stability of the free nations of the world than
a forward move in this direction. The need for
such progress seemed all the greater at a time when
many western countries are faced with the necessity
of supporting effective defence programs over a
long period.
The United States and Canadian ministers found
encouragement in many of the economic developments that have taken place over the past year.
They noted that gold and dollar reserves of other
countries, generally, have been rising; that there
has been a marked improvement in the internal
economic stability of many countries; and that
these favourable developments have made possible
some relaxation of import restrictions. Nevertheless,
it was agreed that the recovery to economic health
has not progressed equally for all countries. What
is needed, it was concluded, is the creation of a
more flexible system of trade and payments
throughout the world which would offer greater
resilience to changing circumstances and which
would contribute dynamically towards rising standards of living. It was agreed that much of the
necessary preparation for such an advance has
already been accomplished by the work of the
Commission on Foreign Economic Policy in the
United States, by the proposals of the Commonwealth Economic Conference, and by discussions
within the organization for European Economic
Co-operation.
In the meantime, it was agreed that it is essential
that pressing, but possibly temporary economic
problems should not be solved by expedients which
might make more difficult the advance on a broad
front that was held to be necessary. One immediate problem which received close consideration
was that raised by the accumulation of large
Special incentives and
agricultural surpluses.
favourable weather conditions have operated in
varying degrees to enlarge these surpluses. The
ministers of both countries recognized that if
suroluses were to be disposed of without regard
to the impact of normal trade, great damage might
be done not only to the commerce of Canada and
United States. but also to the world economy. The
ministers reaffirmed that it is the continuing policy
of their respective governments, in disposing of
agricultural surpluses abroad, to consult with interested countries and not to interfere with normal
commercial marketings. They stated that it is their
settled intention that any extraordinary measures
that might be adopted to reduce surpluses should
result in greater consumption and should augment,
and not disolace, normal quantities of agricultural
products entering into world trade.
In advancing toward a freer system of world
trade and payments, it was agreed that existing
international organizations would continue to play
The valuable work already
an important role.
done by the International Monetary Fund, the
International Bank, and the Contracting Parties
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
was recognized. Ministers noted with satisfaction
the arrangements which have recently been made
within the Fund to enable its resources to be
used more effectively. Acknowledgment was also

MARCH 18, 1954
made of the useful service that has been verformed by GATT in developing a code of commercial conduct and in providing a forum where
multilateral tariff agreements could be negotiated
and where the problems of commercial policy
could be discussed. It was appreciated that it is
for countries whose currencies are now inconvertible to decide when and under what circumstances they might wish to make them convertible.
It was also realized that enlightened economic
policies on the part of the United States and
Canada will materially contribute to establishing
and maintaining broader freedom of trade and
payments throughout the world. Because of the
importance of that objective. the United States
and Canadian ministers warmly welcomed the evidence of a desire in many countries to take decisive
stens toward the restoration of a broad area of
convertibility, and expressed a willingness to do
their part to help in making such a movement
successful.
The discussions at this meeting of the Joint
Committee were marked by friendliness and candour which are characteristic of relations between
the two countries. At the Invitation of the Canadian ministers, the second meeting of the Joint
Committee will be held in Ottawa.

THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Secretary to the Governor General,
acquainting him that the Right Honourable
Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief Justice of Canada,
acting as Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General, would proceed to the Senate
Chamber this day at 5.45 p.m., for the purpose of giving the Royal Assent to certain
bills.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon Mr. Beaubien (for the Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce) presented the report of the committee on Bill 102.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the bill (102 from
the House of Commons) intituled: "An Act to
promote the construction of new houses, the repair
and modernization of existing houses, and the
improvement of housing and living conditions",
have in obedience to the order of reference of
March 16, 1954, examined the said bill and now beg
leave to report the same without any amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave of the
house, I move third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would like to ask the
chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee whether the report just presented
was adopted unanimously.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I presented the report on behalf of the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
who is absent from the chamber. As far
as my recollection is concerned, the decision
to report the bill without amendment was
unanimous.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is correct.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, in
view of that I wish to make a few remarks
before this bill receives third reading. We
heard some very interesting evidence in committee, and I must say right away that Mr.
Mansur, President of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, was an excellent witness. He was very co-operative and attempted
to answer all questions that were asked him.
I gained the impression that the committee
would have liked him to continue for another
two or three hours discussing other interesting points in connection with this important
bill. In the debate on second reading my
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) made such an excellent speech in denouncing this legislation
from stem to gudgeon that I expected he
would at least have proposed some amendments in committee. However, the committee have now reported the bill without
amendment.
Incidentally, during his speech here my
leader rather astonished me, for he is not
a boastful man, by making a sort of boast
that he would take a back seat to no one in
knowledge of values of houses and land. I
hope he had in mind only building land in
cities, for if he was including farm lands he
was taking in altogether too much territory.
I may be all alone in my views on this
bill, and it may be that they are wrong, but
I am in duty bound to express them. Mr.
Mansur's evidence certainly indicated to me
that by this new housing program Canada
was embarking on an undertaking somewhat
inflationary in nature. We were told in committee that in the last four years houses of
the type contemplated by the bill had
advanced $2,000 in cost of construction. That
is significant.
I am opposed to the principle of a man
being under any kind of bondage. We talk
about proper standards of living and other
things, but I am not convinced that all the
children who come from mansions turn out
well and those who are reared in overcrowded log cabins turn out badly. As a

SENATE
matter of fact, indications pretty well are
that those who were raised in little homes
are the people who fill the responsible positions in life today. And they are the ones
who keep out of jail.
This legislation seems to be an entirely
new departure. I derived great pleasure
from making my home and adding to it as
the years went by, but I do not know
whether that will be the case with those who
avail themselves of this legislation. However, the remarks I wish to make on that
will be more properly made when we are
considering the amendments to the Bank Act.
Honourable senators, I want to register my
disapproval of the bill. I am opposed to this
type of legislation, and, specifically, to the
passing of the bill in its present form. At
the committee I asked Mr. Mansur whether,
if the banks found that all the funds they
wished to lend could be placed in a security
guaranteed up to 98 per cent, the result
would not be to reduce the amount available
for individuals who needed loans to carry on
their business; and the best answer I could
get from him was that Mr. Towers, the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, did not
think that that would happen. Well, unfortunately Mr. Towers' knowledge in banking
matters has not been gained on the same
side of the counter as mine; his experience
as a customer is very limited indeed.
Having made these few remarks, I repeat
that I object to the bill, even though I may
do so alone.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
in view of what has been said by the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), probably I should say a word or
two. I am opposed to the bill, not for the
reasons he has given, but because it will not
do what its sponsors say it will do. No
amendments to the bill which I could have
moved in committee would have changed it.
What we ought to do is to encourage a type
of housing which can be rented at prices
that people can afford to pay. The proportion
of the population which still requires houses
and is economically able to buy them is very
small indeed, and it is amply protected by
existing legislation. The difference between
a deposit of $2,000 and of $1,400 is too small
to change the situation materially. I emphasize that the real difficulty is in the case of
people who cannot afford to buy a house of
any kind. I have suggested remedies for this
condition, but I have no power to make any
motion which calls for an expenditure of
money; and this my honourable friend from
Blaine Lake knows as well as I do.
Let me reiterate that my view of the bill
is unchanged. I do not think it will do any

good at all to the class of people who need
assistance in regard to housing. Except for
the bank loan feature I can see no difference
in principle between this bill and the existing law. If we were to reject the bill, a man
who wanted to build a house would still be
free to pay a certain percentage of the cost
in cash, and would have a period of twenty
years or so in which to repay his mortgage
loan. What is now proposed, and what I
object to, is the diversion of bank savings to
mortgage loans. That, in my opinion, is
fundamentally objectionable. Yesterday, when
I was asking questions in committee, I
inquired what would happen, when a default
occurred, other than that the manager would
have to take proceedings right away. Mr.
Mansur made what I must admit was a very
sensible reply, that under regulations now
in force, and valid until they are changed,
action to cancel mortgage loans immediately
upon default would not be compulsory. The
lender, which might be the bank, would
communicate with the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, who would advise
whether in their opinion foreclosure proceedings should be taken. The bank, if
advised to take proceedings, must do so if
it wishes the government to continue its
guarantee on the mortgage loan. On the
other hand, if the bank is advised that proceedings should not be taken against the
borrower, its mortgage will continue to have
the backing of the government. That is something about which I was alarmed. As a
member of the Senate, and not as a member
of any political party, I always try to do my
best to improve legislation that comes before
this house, by trying to see that it is made
as reasonable as possible, and that it will do
what it proposes. If in committee I have
insufficient support to carry an amendment
I might make, then I endeavour to have the
witnesses give a clear explanation as to
how specific sections of the bill will be
administered.
The original draft of the regulations which
Mr. Mansur mentioned did not give the borrower a fair chance. They provided that
foreclosure proceedings had to be taken
within so many months, and that the banks
were compelled to take them whether they
wanted to or not. The Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has suggested
that this action would not be compulsory,
but a representative of the banks made it
quite clear in committee that my view was
right. He further said that, while he did not
like the overall legislation, be felt that an
improvement had been made. Speaking as a
lawyer, I would say that my objection to
the mechanics of the bill bas been removed.
I am, of course, opposed to banks lending

MARCH 18, 1954
money on mortgages, and I think I have
already made this point abundantly clear. It
was impossible for me to have anything
changed as to this matter, but I think our
Banking and Commerce Committee was wise
in having Mr. Mansur outline exactly what
the regulations, as approved by the minister,
will contain.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the Senate committee should be commended for obtaining
this statement from Mr. Mansur. I have little
doubt that in any event the government
would have administered the regulations that
Mr. Mansur outlined but now it has been
publicly stated just what will be done.
I can appreciate the remarks of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), and I must say that I agree with
much of what he has said. For one thing, I
certainly know that many of our best citizens
were raised in humble homes. But that is not
the issue here. We are trying to provide
homes for those who need them, but unfortunately I do not feel that this or any other
legislation can fully achieve this end. The
Good Book says we shall always have the
poor with us. For this reason we shall never
be able to provide homes that all Canadians
will be able to afford. This proposed new
Housing Act does not solve the problem of
providing living accommodation for all classes
of our people, but I think my suggestion
would.
I am sorry that I was not in the chamber
when the Leader of the Governient (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) closed the debate on the
second reading of this bill. As honourable
senators know, there was in Ottawa this week
a certain political convention, which I was
supposed to attend. I missed putting in an
appearance during the first two and a half
days of the convention, and I had to show
up once if I wanted to be recognized as a
Conservative. May I say to the leader that
the housing project in Winnipeg about which
he spoke was not turned down by the ratepayers of that city; the provincial govermnent
simply refused to put up their share of the
capital. Their attitude was that this project
should involve only the City of Winnipeg
and the federal government, and that if the
federal government put up 75 per cent of
the money the city should put up the remaining 25 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Was there not a vote on
this issue in Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there was no vote. I
am not criticizing the provincial government,
for had I been a member of the legislature I
would have supported their stand.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Was there not a bylaw in the city of Winnipeg on which a vote
was taken?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. Many votes have been
taken on housing matters in Winnipeg, but
this was something new.
Honourable senators, I am still opposed to
this legislation, for I do not feel that it is
going to achieve what it proposes. At the
same time I do think the Senate committee
was wise in having a declaration made before
it on the question of foreclosure.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not wish to enter into the controversy between the honourable gentleman
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and his
leader in this house (Hon. Mr. Haig). They
no doubt will settle their differences; we
have enough troubles of our own.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I merely wish to say
it has been amply proven to at least the vast
majority of the members of this house that
the savings of Canadian citizens held in
banks, when invested in these mortgages,
will have excellent security behind them, that
of the Government of Canada. As I said in
my remarks when moving the second reading
of this bill, there is no better security than
that in the whole wide world.
The honourable gentleman from Blaine
Lake remarked that many fine Canadian
citizens have come from log-cabin homes.
We all agree with that observation, and some
of us, while not coming from log cabins,
have not come from mansions. I do not
believe, however, that there is one member
of this house who thinks that Canadians of
the present and coming generations should
be reared in log cabins. We want to give our
people the best possible homes. We want
our Canadian families to live in good homes
and happy surroundings, and to enjoy as
many modern conveniences as possible. This
is the goal towards which this legislation is
aimed. We are not living in log-cabin days,
and we do not want to turn back to those
times. We must be realists. We are living
in the year 1954, under improved conditions
which our fathers helped to bring about, and
we want to continue improving them.
The Leader of the Opposition has said that
this legislation will not provide homes for a
certain class of our people. While that is
true as to people who are unable to provide
the down-payment or set aside 23 per cent
of their wages towards meeting monthly payments, it will improve housing conditions
in Canada. More houses in Canada will mean
more opportunity for people who rent to
obtain homes. When there is a scarcity of

SENATE
houses people bid not only for houses to
buy, but also for houses to rent, and under
those circumstances rents naturally go up.
If because of this legislation more houses are
made available for rent, the people will
benefit.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) does not think the legislation
will work; but some of us do think it will
work. At any rate, it will be in effect for
at least a year, and we shall see what
happens in that time. The honourable gentleman said the banks were not enthusiastiche did not use that word, but I think that
is what he meant-about the legislation.
However, he will recall that the President of
the Bankers' Association said the banks were
not opposing the legislation; he also said, in
effect, that the banks are prepared to give it
a fair trial. I ask this house to give the
bill third reading now, and let the government give it a fair trial.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the honourable Senator Macdonald, seconded by the
honourable Senator Lambert, for third reading of Bill 102. Is it your pleasure to adopt

they have to be sworn in as special constables of municipal or provincial police
forces or of the R.C.M.P., but under this
amendment the board itself will have the
right to appoint them. In the Railway Act
there is a similar provision, under which the
railways are empowered to appoint constables with authority within a designated
area of railway property to carry out duties
related to enforcement of the Railway Act.
I must say, honourable senators, that this
power to appoint police constables, which is
contained in section 3 of the bill, is a rather
unusual one in a number of respects. First
of all, the language is perhaps a little wider
than it might be, in so far as it appears to
give those constables power in relation to
the protection of other property of Her
Majesty than that belonging to the board.
That, I think, may be a matter which we
shall have to discuss in committee. There is
also a rather unusual power given to constables so appointed by the board: they are
to have authority in any place not more than
fifty miles distant from the 'property under
the administration of the board. That is an
unusual provision, and I think the Senate
will have to be satisfied in committee as to
the necessity for it. There is a third respect
in which this power to appoint constables
appears to be somewhat unusual. Under subsection (2) of the proposed new section 4A
it appears that a police constable so
appointed may take any person, charged
with an offence under the act, before any
court, whether that court had jurisdiction
within the area in which the offence was
committed, or not.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is somewhat unusual.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I point out these
things to honourable senators as matters
which, I think, should be discussed in committee and in respect of which proper
explanations should be had from departmental officials before the bill is passed in its
present form-if passed it be.
The next matter relates to the powers of the
National Harbours Board to have work carried
on without tender. Under the present act, any
work which the board wishes to have done
must be carried on after public tender, provided the cost is to be $10,000 or more. The
bill before us increases this limit from $10,000
-which, bear in mind, was fixed in the year
1936-to $15,000; and I direct the attention of
the house to the fact that in this respect it
corresponds to a similar amendment which
was made to the Public Works Act in 1951.
The bill also provides that no contract for
work in excess of $15,000 shall be awarded by
the board without the approval of the Governor in Council, except in one case. That is

where public tenders have been called, where
two or more tenders have been received
and the work has been awarded to the lowest
tenderer, in which case the limit is increased
to $50,000. I should perhaps explain that this
provision brings the practice of the board in
respect of the awarding of contiacts into line
with contract regulations made under the
Financial Administration Act.
As so often happens in bills of this kind,
the power of the Governor in Council to make
by-laws under the act is extended in various
ways. First of all, power is given to make
by-laws clarifying the right of the board to
purchase and sell property other than land.
There appears to be some doubt under the
act as it now stands whether the National
Harbours Board has power to purchase supplies and materials and to sell scrap, waste,
and so on, without getting specific authority
from the Governor in Council upon each occasion. This amendment will permit the Governor in Council to make by-laws under the
act authorizing the Harbours Board to purchase and sell property other than land.
The bill would also empower the Governor
in Council to pass by-laws permitting the
Harbours Board to restrict its liability for
damage to property under its care, in cases
where it is felt that the liability should be
restricted.
For instance, the board may
grant permission to bring explosives into a
harbour, or it may accept highly perishable
goods in storage. In such cases the board
should have the right to contract with the
owner of those materials that it will not
accept liability for any damage occurring to
the property while under its care.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that power not now
vested in the National Harbours Board?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Apparently not. This is
to establish beyond dispute the right of the
Governor in Council to permit the board to
exercise such power.
The Governor in Council would further be
authorized by the bill to make by-laws
governing the transportation, handling and
storing of explosives and other dangerous
substances on property belonging to private
individuals under the jurisdiction of the
board. The board has this authority now
with respect to dangerous goods on its own
property, and it is proposed to extend this
authority to such goods on private property
within harbour areas and under the jurisdiction of the Board.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The right to do what?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The right to restrict or
to make regulations with respect to the
transporting, handling and storing of explosives and other dangerous substances.

MARCH 24, 1954
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does it limit the board's
liability?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, it authorizes the
Governor in Council to make regulations with
respect to the handling and storage of explossives and other dangerous materials on
privately owned property under the jurisdiction of the board.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does not the board now
have jurisdiction over all property, private
and otherwise, within any harbours in which
it operates?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am informed that as
the act now stands it is doubtful if the board
has the right to prevent explosives from
being stored on private property within a
harbour area, and that this amendment is
designed to make it quite clear that it will
have that right in future.
Another clause in the bill provides for
extension of the board's lien on goods in its
possession, for storage and other charges. As
the act now stands, the board has a lien for
board charges incurred in respect of those
particular goods only. In practice that has
been found unsatisfactory when applied to
the large-scale warehousing operations conducted by the board. The proposed amendment gives the board a general lien enforceable against any of the goods of a debtor to
the board, whether the debt was incurred in
respect of those specific goods or not.
The provisions for seizure and for the sale
of goods subject to the board's lien for unpaid charges are clarified. An amendment
provides that where such goods have been
seized, the board's charges shall not continue
to accrue for a period of more than thirty
days.
The next amendment is designed to remedy
a rather curious anomaly. Under the present
act a violation of a by-law passed under the
act constitutes an offence, whereas a violation of the act proper does not. The existing
section 22 of the act is repealed and replaced
by a proposed new section 22, which provides
a penalty for contravention of either the act
itself or any by-law enacted pursuant to its
provisions.
A section in the present act deals with the
estimated annual budget the board is
required to submit to the Minister. That
section is deleted, and by its removal the
National Harbours Board automatically becomes subject to the general provisions of
the Financial Administration Act relating to
crown corporations. Under that act crown
corporations are required to submit budget
estimates every year to the minister to whom
it is their duty to report, and these estimates
have to be approved jointly by that minister
and the Minister of Finance.

A number of other provisions in the bill,
mostly of minor importance, are inserted for
the purpose either of clarification or better
draughtsmanship. For instance, elaborate
provisions in the present act relate to the
seizure, detention and sale by the board of
vessels and goods, in various contingencies.
Those provisions have been entirely rewritten,
but there is no material change in substance.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I draw the honourable
senator's attention to the new section appearing at the bottom of page 6:
20 (1) The board may seIl, with or without
advertisement or caIl for tenders, as the board
deems expedient, the whole or any part of any
goods seized-

That is surely a very far-reaching provision.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The powers proposed
there do not vary much from those given
under the present section 20 (1), which provides that:
The board may sell et public auction or by
private tender the whole or any part of the goods
seized-

If there are any further questions on that
point they should be raised in committee.
I was about to suggest that if the house
should see fit to pass the second reading, the
bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Under the bill would

And:
"Vessel" includes any ship, boat, barge, raft,

craft.
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the
bill amends the definition of "vessel" to
include "seaplane on the water".
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why is the word "seaplane"
used in that particular paragraph, while in
other parts of the bill the word "aircraft" is
used?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To what parts of the
bill does my friend refer?
Hon. Mr. Reid: To various parts; for
instance, in subsection 2 of section 6 of the
bill there appear the words "on vessels or
aircraft". I think you will find "aircraft"
mentioned three times.

I am rather horrified by the proposed new what is said in committee is not always

MARCH 24. 1954
which takes place in committees, is flot given
the publicity which modern business and
public affairs require. For that reason, I
think it is a good thing to debate this
measure on second reading.
The hon-ourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said, in effect, that in his
experience in political life he has found that
those responsible for the administration of
government, departments are always looking
for an easy way to make their administration
efficient, and that they are flot too particular
about the liberty of the subject. In my own
experience I have found that not to apply
to any one in particular, but it has been the
trend. In other words, the trend has been
for officiais to take unto themselves power
s0 that they can do things efficiently and
arbitrarily.
With regard to the question of explosives,
I can well see that with the increase in the
use of explosives and that sort of thing,
protection must be given against any danger
from the handling of these substances in an
area to which the public have access.
As to the appointment of constables by the
Harbours Board, I think that we are al
pretty well agreed that something must be
done to protect pmoperty and persons along
the waterfronts. On the New York waterfront a disturbance has been going on recently
between unions and port authority as to who
is the bargaining agent for the dock workers
and who should load the ships, and this has
caused many ships to be tied up in that port.
That situation has brought forcibly to our
attention how important it is for a harbour
authority to have a police force to promote
law and order in the operation and carrying
out of the work in the harbour under its
jurisdiction.
Many of the amendments. proposed in this
bull are salutary; they provide for changes
that are needed. It seems to me, however,
that the bill should go to committee, and that
there we should look very carefully into the
effect that certain proposed amendments
would have on individuals and their rights.
We have a function to look after the rights
of the individual and the rlghts of the
niinority, and we should take care to see that
no drastic law is passed which might override the rights of the people through providing officiais with an easy way of performidng
their duties. Such a law is always a cause of
irritation and usually is not for the public
good. We are told on excellent authority that
the least government is the best government.
Hon. Gordon B. Imnor: Honourable senators,
before the bill is given second reading I
would like to say a few words in regard to
the remarks made by the honourable senator

from Toronto-Trinity <Hon. Mr. Roebuck). Let
me say first of ail, however, that I arn certainly not going to pose as an expert on
legal intempretation of statutes. 1 am wondering only whether the honourable senator's
interpretation of the section regarding constables is made in the light of practical
consequences.
The enlarging of the area to be covered
by the constables wrnl bring about a great
improvement so far as the port of Halifax is
concerned. At the present time they have
jurisdiction over the immediate property of
the National Harbours Board, which is located
in the ocean terminals at the south end of
our city, but which, properly speaking,
extends to the extreme north of the harbour,
perhaps a distance of six or seven miles.
In addition ýto that, there is private property
over which the National Harbours Board, I
feel, at present has no jurisdiction, and I am
very pleased to learn that the bili proposes
greater authority for the constables in this
regard.
As I read the last few lines of that particular section, it would appear to me that a
magistrate who may be cailed upon to deal
with a complaint has jurisdiction to deal with
it only if it arises in his own particular amea.
It would cetainly be strange to think that
a proceeding of that kind could be transferred
from, say, Toronto to Halifax, or from Montreal to Vancouver. As a layman I would
hesitate to pit my judgment as to the meaning
of those Unmes against the good judgment o!
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), but I stili feel that a
common-sense interpretation of the provision
would lead one to think as I do.
I am pleased to note that the bill proposes
to extend the jurisdiction of National Harbours Board constables to a fifty-mile distance
from property administered by the board. I
think it is only right and proper that jurisdiction should be given over vessels coming into
and approaching the ports. From time to
time cases arise in Halifax, in connection with
incoming ships over which there is no harboum police jurisdlction-even up in Bedford
Basin, a distance of eight or ten miles.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable senatom allow me to dmaw his attention to the
fact that under this bill it is proposed to give
jurisdiction to magistrates in the area within
which the pmoperty is located, irrespective o!
the place wheme the act or the omission complained of occurred. Let us suppose that
an iliegal act or omission concerning certain
goods occurred in Halifax and that subsequently the goods were located in Montreal:
then the pemson alleged to have committed
that offence in Halifax could be called upon

SENATE
to defend himself in Montreal. That is
against all the fundamental principles applying to such matters, and that is the point
which the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has raised. I
think that point is worthy of serious
consideration.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, again
a very brilliant member of the legal profession has given us his interpretation of the
section, and I certainly would not offer my
layman's opinion against that of the learned
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I simply wanted to draw the
honourable senator's attention to what might
happen under this wording.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I still feel that action has
to be taken in the area in which the crime
or offence was committed.
I am very glad to see that the bill makes
a change whereby the board's budget must
be submitted to the Minister of Finance and
approved in the same way as the budgets of
government departments are. I am also
pleased to note that the bill would require
all accounts of the National Harbours Board
to be audited by the Auditor General. I
have always taken the stand that that procedure should apply to all agencies of the
government.
I feel it would be most appropriate to have
this bill referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications, so that
a few differences of opinion may be ironed
out. The point raised by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) in regard to the proposal that seized
goods may be sold without tenders being
called for, should be looked into very carefully and discussed in committee with the
distinguished senator who presented the bill.

There are other points which may be open
to criticism, but I feel that if this proposal
were given effect to it would bring on criticism. My suggestion on this is that the
procedure followed by the Canadian National
Railways in similar situations should be
adopted.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

will be ready for distribution some time in

SENATE
April. I have been in touch with the Department of External Affairs and have received
what amounts to almost an assurance that
the Senate will be able to obtain sufficient
copies of this report to permit a general distribution to honourable members.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am very pleased to hear
that. A custom has developed which has
the effect of placing honourable members in
a secondary position through having to ask
civil servants for copies of certain documents
which we should receive as a matter of
right.
OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved the second
reading of Bill K-13, an Act to amend the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I must first
thank the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the honour
he has done me in asking me to explain the
proposed amendments to this Act.
The purpose of the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act is to provide a means by which
certain narcotic drugs can be made available
for medical and scientific purposes, andchiefly-to eliminate as soon and as completely as possible the improper use of these
drugs. Everyone who has realized the effect
of addiction on the ordinary individual,
physically, morally, mentally, and the misery
that it brings to his family and relatives,
will be anxious to see this traffic completely
discontinued.
The object of the two main amendments
of the act which are before us is to make
opium and certain of its derivatives available
for legal-medical purposes. No one will
question the value of these drugs to suffering
people. They are used in surgery, they are
employed to ease pain in cases resulting
from accident and other things, and they
make life a little easier and a little happier
for people who suffer from incurable cancer
and other malignant diseases.
As regards the first amendment to which I
will draw attention, namely, the proposed
new section 5 of the act, experience has
shown that certain cough mixtures and some
mild analgesics are not dangerous from the
addiction standpoint. At the present time,
to procure some of these cough medicines
or mild analgesics, the patient has to go to
a doctor, who is required to make out a
prescription on which must appear the name
of the patient, the name of the drug, the
quantity required, the date and the doctor's
signature; and upon that prescription the

supply cannot be repeated. It is felt that
this requirement, as respects some of these
mild mixtures, is unduly rigid, and it is now
proposed that a druggist may dispense such
drugs by verbal telephone order from a
medical man. Of course, only small quantities of drugs, mixed with other ingredients,
and intended as a remedy for a cough or
some other minor affection, may be dispensed in this way.
The second amendment to which I wish to
refer is the proposed repeal of section 4 of
the act and the substitution of new section 4,
which deals with illegal possession of drugs
and trafficking in them. This amendment is
really of great importance. I may say that
during recent years much progress has been
made by officers of the Department of
National Health and Welfare in suppressing
this traffic. They are 'of opinion that the
traffickers are the chief offenders, and from
that point of view this amendment has, you
might say, established a more severe penalty
for the crime. It is directed towards the
detection and conviction of those found
guilty of distributing and selling narcotic
drugs for which they have no licence. In
this connection it can be said that harshness
bas no place, but at the same time provision
must be made for penalties for illicit possession and illicit distribution of narcotic drugs.
I read just yesterday that the present method
of handling these people is a compound of
folly, futility and brutality, but I do not
feel these words apply here at all. If people
were allowed to have these drugs in their
possession either for their own use or for
sale, and not be subject to punishment, many
addicts from other countries would come to
Canada. The new section 4 of the act makes
a distinction between a person who has drugs
in his possession for his own use and a person who has drugs in his possession for the
purpose of trafficking. It is sometimes very
difficult to distinguish between the two. For
instance, a police officer who finds a quantity of drugs on a man's person or in his
room or in his car may have difficulty in
determining whether or not the man has
them for the purpose of trafficking.
During the years 1951 to 1953, inclusive,
1,062 convictions were made under this act.
Of these, 990 were for illegal possession, and
the remaining 72 for possession and distribution. However, in many of the cases where
drugs were found to be in illegal possession,
they also may have been meant for
distribution.
I should like to set forth the law under the
present section 4 of the act, and also that
under the amendment. Under the present
section a person who has no right to have

MARCH 25, 1954
drugs and yet manufactures, sells, gives away
or distributes drugs is liable to punishment.
,On summary conviction he may be imprisoned for a term of six months or up to
eighteen months. He can be fined not more
than $1,000, and at the discretion of the
magistrate he can be whipped. If convicted
under indictment for a more serious offence,
he may be imprisoned for a term anywhere
from six months to seven years. He must be
fined at least $200 and he can be whipped at
the discretion of the judge.
The new section changes that to some
extent. It removes monetary penalties altogether, because it has been found that those
people do not pay the fines imposed. It also
removes the discretionary power to order
whipping, except for trafficking or possession for trafficking. Further, it provides that
every person found in illegal possession of
any drug is liable upon indictment to a term
not exceeding eighteen months and not less
than six months.
The "six months" is
retained. Why? Because the convicted person is taken away from drugs for at least
six months. I know it has been said that
he can get drugs in jail; probably he can,
but not very often; and we know that some
who have fortitude and will-power are cured
after six months detention in jail. However,
the fellow who is caught selling or trafficking
in drugs is much more severely dealt with.
He can be imprisoned for a period up to fourteen years, and the judge may order him to
be whipped. A great deal is left to the discretion of the judge.
A minor change is proposed in respect to
the punishment of those who grow any opium
poppy or Cannabis Sativa. Some of this is
grown through ignorance of the law by
foreigners who like to sprinkle the seeds on
their buns; but there must be provision for
punishment, because the opium might be
grown for a commercial reason. Under the
present law the minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed is six months. The
bill removes this minimum and provides that
upon summary conviction a person may be
sentenced to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding eighteen months; and upon conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding seven years.
Honourable senators, this act and the traffic
it aims to control are of great human interest.
A narcotic drug addict can hardly get along
without the drug. It brings him tranquility,
a gentle peace; his troubles disappear, and his
nind wanders over fields of happiness and
sunshine. But very soon the effect wears off,
his restlessness returns with its accompanying misery, together with a terrible craving
for the drug, and he will do almost anything
83280-25à

in order to obtain it: he will sacrifice position,
money, friends and family, or anything he
has, in order to get the drugs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Are the drugs named in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Opium derivatives are
named.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They are named?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes, they are referre«
to.
I have spoken of the two principal amendments. There are some further consequential
amendments, just to bring the changes into
operation. The chief amendment is aimed at
strengthening the hands of the police officers,
particularly for the purpose of stopping trafficking in drugs. Fabulous sums of money are
involved in this illicit business, and the percentage of profit for those engaged in it is
very high. The peddling is done through a
chain of individuals, each of whom takes his
share of profit, and a drug that sells legally
for $12 may bring as much as $5,000 or $8,000
when sold to addicts. An addict pays $3 to $5
for one capsule, and he may take as many
as fifteen capsules a day. In order to get the
necessary money to pay for these drugs,
men and women resort to underworld practices, thievery, and al that kind of thing.
It must be stated that many of these people
have no homes; they drift from place to place
and live from hand to mouth; they are often
unstable and insecure persons, with records
of juvenile delinquency, and are themselves
the product of broken homes and unfortunate
social conditions.
The amendments in the bill do not cover
the entire field, because it is not yet clear
what more effective steps can be taken at
present to bring about the desired results.
There are treatment centres located in various
places in the United States, such as Lexington and Fort Worth, but no statistics as to
the extent of their success are yet available.
In Vancouver and throughout British Columbia, where there are a great many drug
addicts, a concentrated effort is being made
to survey the situation; a committee has been
set up, and its members have already visited
Lexington and other treatinent centres. It
will hear witnesses testify on the drug question, and its report will no doubt contain
material which should be incorporated in a
more complete revision of the act.
Suggested cures go all the way from complete quarantine to supplying drugs to registered addicts. The results have not been
uniformly successful in any place. Practical
treatment of the problem would seem to
require the acquisition of an institution big
enough to hold Canada's 3,000 drug addicts

SENATE
under strict quarantine. Some of them would
have to stay there for life; some would go
out apparently cured and revert to the habit;
but others, with the assistance of the John
Howard Society, might throw off the vicious
habit. I do feel, however, that the treatment
of these unfortunate people extends over a
wide field. The hope of preventing children
and young people from starting the habit lies
in better home conditions, better education,
social conditions and food, and the dangers of
the habit should be impressed upon them
through health education and welfare care.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I should like to ask a
question of the honourable senator who has
explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). I
read in the press recently an article by a
writer who had interviewed a drug addict.
The writer pointed out that in England the
method of handling the drug habit is quite
different from our method. He went on to
say that over there drug addiction is treated
as an illness instead of a crime. I wonder
whether the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has read that
:article, and if so, what comment he has to
:nake on it?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators, I
'have read the article to which my honourable
lriend refers, and I based some of my remarks
upon it.
I would point out that in England the drug
problem is not as serious as it is here. I have
made inquiries about their so-called system
whereby an addict can go to a certain place
and get an injection for a few cents, and I am
informed it is extremely doubtful if such a
system is really in operation and if it produces the results which the writer of the
article claims for it.
Hon. Nancy Hodges: Honourable senators,
I listened with a great deal of interest to
what the honourable senator from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) had to say on the
question of the treatment of drug addicts.
I am tremendously interested in this question,
because of the fact that for a very long
time women's organizations in British Columbia have been greatly concerned about the
increase in the number of drug addicts, and
particularly about the increased use of drugs
among the younger people of the community.
That it is not just a nebulous fear. That
the drug traffic is increasing has been more
than proved in the last few days by reports
from Vancouver on the situation which has
arisen there or has recently come to light
concerning the terrific addiction in that city.
A member of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, an officer who has been engaged in
this particular branch of police work for
some years, estimates that there are more

than a thousand addicts on the streets of
Vancouver at all times, and another five
hundred in jail for various offences. He also
says that no comparable statisties on addiction in other cities are available; but the
fact that his force of twenty men is double
the size of any other Royal Canadian Mounted
Police drug detachment in Canada speaks for
itself.
At another point in his report the same
officer, whose experience has made him an
authority on the subject, says that dealing
with drug addiction is like working in a
bowling alley-you knock one pin down
and another pops up. He then asks: Why
does the drug traffic fiourish, despite the concentrated efforts of police forces all over the
world to stamp it out? The answer to that
is easy, he says, because it is the highest-paid
form of crime today. Figures that he gives
differ just a little from some given by the
honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw). The officer says that one ounce
of heroin with its various adulterations, which
would cost $13 to buy legally, is worth $4,000
on the illegal market.
I mention these things to show that illicit
traffic in narcotic drugs is more than an
academic question on the west coast of this
country, and we feel that the time has come
to use stronger measures against it than are
being used at the present time. That is why
I rise to speak on this bill. I am in thorough
agreement with the proposed steps to care
for addicts, because I think those unfortunate people deserve not only our compassion but our help in every way possible.
They are victims of circumstances which we
more fortunate people do not understand.
I am glad to see that whipping has been
removed from the punishment meted out to
convicted addicts, but I do feel, honourable
senators, that the bill does not go far enough
yet in dealing with the higher-ups in the
drug traffic. I am not speaking of the
ordinary drug peddler on the street, bad
though he is-and incidentally, I am glad to
see that whipping is retained as part of the
punishment for a convicted drug peddler.
Although I am a woman, I think the infliction of the lash, or what is euphemistically
called a spanking, upon a drug peddler is
nothing when compared with the damage or
injury he does to the victims of his nefarious
trade.
I do think we should provide more severe
punishment for the higher-ups in the drug
traffic, those men who sit rather like bloated
obscene spiders spinning a vile web in which
to lure and enmesh the innocent victims of
their bestial trade. I feel very strongly that
nothing in this act is sufficient to deal with
these people. The honourable senator from

MARCH 25, 1954
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) suggested
that harshness should not be used towards
them. It seems to me we cannot deal harshly
enough with those who are at the head of
this terrible traffic in human lives. After all,
they are potential murderers of men's souls,
and in my estimation their crime is infinitely
worse than the homicide of an individual.
You may think, perhaps, that my words are
a little strong. If so, I would commend to
your attention a book called Murder Incorporated, written by Burton Turkus, and published in New York in 1951. It is not fiction,
it is not a "whodunit"; it is an exposé of
organized crime, organized rackets, fully
documented from official records, by a former
United States attorney. He reveals the dreadful, the almost incredible ramifications of
such rackets as the illegal traffic in drugs.
Higher-ups like Lucky Luciano, whose name
is brought up in connection with the Vancouver situation-whether rightly or wrongly,
I do not know-are indicted in this book.
When you read what this book says about
the extent to which this bestial traffic is
carried and its effect on human lives, on
human souls, you may agree that we have
got to go further than just mete out prison
sentences and a whipping as punishment for
persons convicted of trafficking in drugs on
a large scale. I want to make it quite clear
that I am now speaking of the higher-ups,
the men who make millions from this bestial
traffic. I would even go so far as to say that
capital punishment should be provided in
the Criminal Code for those convicted of such
trafficking.
In my estimation, a person who murders
one individual is not in the same category at
all as these people who are responsible not
only directly, but indirectly as well, for
many murders. And you have only to read
Murder Incorporated to realize how many
murders are committed by drug addicts who
are temporarily insane through being
deprived of their drugs. We in Vancouver
know, and in fact it has been demonstrated
from police reports there, that the drug traffic
amounts to an annual business of well over
seven million dollars in the form of prostitution, organized vice, organized crime of
various descriptions. As a matter of fact,
mere figures can never tell the full story of
the terrible business these people do. I do feel
very strongly, honourable senators, that if
hanging is ever justified at all, it is certainly
justified in the case of these people whom I
call the higher-ups. If we ever catch any of
them, I do not think that a jail sentence
would be sufficient; in fact I think that even
hanging would be too easy a punishment
for them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. Hodges: I have no more to say
honourable senators, but I did want to put
before this house my point of view, as a
woman, on this bill.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the
debate was adjourned.
EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill 374, an Act respecting
the export and import of strategic and other
goods.
He said: Honourable senators, it was my
privilege to introduce legislation on this subject, in the first place, in the House of
Commons in 1947. Before that date, the
export and import control which was exercised was derived from authority contained
in the Emergency Powers Act. The existing
legislation will expire on July 31 of this
year, and by this bill it is intended to permit
continuance of the government's present
powers of export and import control.
With regard to exports, the purposes of
controls are found in section 3 of the bill.
With regard to imports, section 5 gives
details of the operation of this legislation.
It is probably not necessary to discuss the
importance of controlling strategic materials
which might find their way into the hands
of a potential enemy. These materials are
controlled to some extent by international
agreements and international co-operation.
An example of this is the United Nations
resolution whereby Canada, along with other
members, enforces an embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunitions and military
material to Communist China. As a result
of our friendly relations with the United
States we enjoy complete freedom from the
operations of their export control, but we
undertake to control the export of goods
originating in the United States to prevent
Canada being used as a back door through
which United States export controls can be
evaded.
In conjunction with our allies-the United
States, Great Britain and other members of
NATO-we have a real interest in ensuring
that no strategic materials find their way
behind the Iron Curtain. One of the great
problems faced by us, however, is not so
much how to control the initial export of
these materials from Canada, but how to
exercise control in such a way as to ensure
that the goods are not diverted in transit to
destinations other than those originally indicated. The real purpose of this legislation
is to plug any holes through which such
diversions might occur.

SENATE
That is not an easy matter. For example,
a reliable Canadian concern might order ballbearings through an agent in Canada who
represents himself as acting for an important
and well-known German manufacturer. The
first shipments would arrive satisfactorily and
the business connection would be continued.
Then, by degrees, orders are fulfilled in part
only, and delays in deliveries become longer.
Finally, it is discovered that, through the
activity of the agent here and some intermediary between Germany and Canada, sizeable quantities of bearings have been diverted,
en route, to behind the Iron Curtain. This is
the type of incident which the bill is intended
to prohibit.
Included in a list of strategic materials
would be arms, ammunition and implements
of war; non-ferrous metals, minerals and
chemicals in primary or manufactured forms,
and in fact anything that might be used in
war industries. Nickel, copper, lead, aluminum, asbestos, as well as automatic machine
tools, large generators and turbines, chemical
plant and aircraft, are in this class of
material.
The controlled items referred to in this
legislation are determined in consultation
with other governments. We with them are
resolved not to supply machinery, for
instance, to a country which is ready to
exploit these items for other than peaceful
means, nor would we be justified in shipping
such materials to a country which would be
unwilling or not able to control re-exports
of the material received from us.
The permit application requires a detailed
description of the goods; its quantity and
value; the United States content must be disclosed, also the port of exit from this country
and the destination. In addition, to ensure
delivery to the designated port, import certification and delivery verification were instituted. This practice confirms delivery to
only the bona fide foreign purchaser and
helps to make impossible the diversion of
Canadian strategic materials to unintended
quarters.
We have, of course, to be particularly careful in Canada to see that goods coming to
us from the United States or other countries
do not get into the wrong hands and that this
country is not used as a base for unscrupulous
trading by undesirable foreign agents. The
case of diversion which I mentioned earlier
illustrates the importance of maintaining the
tightest possible control on these materials.
Such diversion may be accomplished by cargo
being re-routed on land or re-manifested
aboard ship, by trans-shipment in part, by
re-shipment from bonded warehouse, or by
re-export from the importing country.

This legislation provides machinery to
avoid these practices.
Export controls have in the past been removed from commodities as soon as the
situation allowed. The list of commodities
controlled has been reduced from 407 in
1948 to 184 in 1953, and although the volume
and value of our external trade have increased vastly during the same period, the
number of licences issued has been reduced
from 113,094 in 1948 to 26,635 in 1953.
With the implementation of tighter controls made possible by this legislation relating
to the control of intransit diversions, we shall
be able to relax licensing requirements on
shipments to almost all countries outside of
those dominated by the Soviet Union. Our
aim will be, as in the past, to keep to the
minimum the number of commodities requiring this control.
In addition to the control of strategic
materials, we must control the export of
certain items because of supply reasons. This,
of course, includes atomic materials which
remain under strict export control.
The control of imports is largely the same
as that set out in the present legislation,
except that the purposes for which import
control may be exercised include specific
authority "to implement an inter-governmental arrangement or commitment". This
change is necessary to define powers required
to carry out arrangements with other governments, particularly the United States. It
is readily understandable that we control our
imports at the request of a foreign government, particularly the United States, rather
than leave it to them to impose export controls on shipments to this country.
I propose to move, if this bibi receives second
reading, that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable senator
has described the type of goods that will
he included in the Export Control List. Could
he tell us something about the goods that
will be included in the Import Control List?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: At the present time
only one item is under import control, and
that is butter.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) gave
an illustration of a Canadian firm sending
ball bearings to Germany, and described how
sizeable quantities of these bearings could be
diverted en route behind the Iron Curtain.
I should like to ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if in such a
case, as a minimum punishment at least, the
responsible Canadian party should not be
named?

MARCH 25, 1954
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: If I may be permitted to reply to my honourable friend,
may I say that I am not just sure what the
government has in mind in this connection.
This legislation provides for certain fines
and penalties, but rather than merely make
the name of the responsible person known I
should think the government would take
some other course of action.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is it proposed to make
this legislation retroactive so as to cover
offences already committed?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I cannot say.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
as I am in agreement with the principle of
this measure I have no intention of delaying
the house, but I wish to say I have always
wondered just what are strategic goods.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a most difficult thing
to determine. For instance, Russia has been
buying sterling with gold, apparently for
the purpose of enabling her to finance
purchases of food from certain countries.
No one knows, of course, what her real
purpose is. Is it not possible that many items
which we do not deem to be strategic are,
in fact, very strategic? It has been reported
that Russia has made inquiries about buying
Canadian-made ships for commercial purposes, and in this connection somebody came
up with the foolish suggestion that ships
could be sold to Russia on the understanding
that they would never be used in the event
of war. Now, how could Canada ever hope
to enforce such a prohibition? Look what
happened after we sold 12 million dollars'
worth of ships to China. Those vessels are
now being used to transport goods from communist China to the Viet Minh communist
troops who are fighting our French allies in
Indo-China.
Has any departmental official ever described
how it is determined what is and what is
not a strategic material? Everyone knows
that guns, airplanes, cannons and war machinery are classified as strategic goods, but
there are many other items which could be
placed on the list. In 1951 many countries
started to buy and stockpile huge quantities
of copper, zinc and lead.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And rubber, oil and
cotton.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I should like some
departmental official to tell us in committee
on what basis strategic goods are determined
as such. If we are told that the determination is a matter of government policy, then
let the person responsible for this policy

make an appearance before the committee.
The world is going through precarious times.
There is much uneasiness in Europe, and
some European countries cannot decide
whether to endorse an agreement which
would place German troops in the European
Army now being raised for the defence of
Western Europe. That attitude by France is
difficult for us to understand. And just
yesterday Italy announced a similar attitude,
threatening that she would not co-operate
unless she is given full control of Trieste. It
is impossible to satisfy France, for we cannot hope to defend the free world without the
help of German arms. That is a pretty hard
statement to have to make. It might be
argued that we could defend ourselves by
using the hydrogen bomb, but the effects
of the recent explosion of such a bomb were
so awesome that I do not believe we shall
ever resort to its use.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: With all due deference to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I think he has moved away from
the subject-matter before the house. Section
3 of the bill provides that the Governor in
Council may establish a list of goods, to be
called an Export Control List, including
therein any article the export of which he
deems it necessary to control for any of a
number of purposes. These purposes are set
out in the bill, and cover the list that will be
made up by the various governments meeting
in, I think, Paris.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What standards will be
used to make up the list? I am entitled to
know this.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there are-two attractive features about this
bill. The first is that the bill is not a series
of disjointed amendments to existing legislation, such as our honourable colleague from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) just had
to deal with in moving the second reading of
Bill K-13, an Act to amend the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act. This legislation is complete in itself, and I venture to suggest that
this is an immense advantage to a layman
such as myself for it enables one to get an
intelligent understanding of what the bill
means.
The other attractive feature about the bill,
to me, is that its term expires in three years,
that is, by July 31, 1957. No one in his
senses would deny the need for controlling
the export of strategic materials, as they
are described. The term "strategic materials"
is given a very wide connotation today. A
few minutes ago, the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) asked for a list of strategic

SENATE
materials, and our colleague the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) who, I thought. explained the bill
very well, replied that they are defined in
section 3 of the bill. But section 3 is pretty
wide in its scope. You will note that it
specifies as strategic materials:
...
arms, ammunition, implements or munitions of
war, naval, army or air stores or any articles
deemed capable of being converted thereinto or
made useful in the production thereof-

I am bound to say that I do not know how
wide that definition is; but I should think
that food, for instance, is an article that
would be useful in the production of the
strategic materials mentioned. If my interpretation is right, the section extends to
a very wide range of articles. I am not
finding fault with that, but I think it is
important for us to realize that this bill
grants very wide powers, and, in many
respects necessarily so.
Section 5, which provides for the control
of imports into Canada, says:
The Governor in Council may establish a list of
goods, to be called an Import Control List, including therein any article the import of which he
deems it necessary to control for any of the following purposes, namely,-

What are the purposes? They are set out
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). I do not
quarrel with paragraphs (a) and (c). Honourable senators will bear in mind that this
measure is designed to control the export
of strategic materials to countries behind the
Iron Curtain, in the general definition of
that term. Paragraph (b) states that the
Governor in Council may establish a list
of goods, to be called an Import Control
List, for any of the following purposes:
(b) to implement any action taken under the
Agricultural Prices Support Act, the Fisheries Prices
Support Act, the Agricultural Products Co-operative
Marketing Act or the Agricultural Products Board
Act, to support the price of the article or that has
the effect of supporting the price of the article.

If I interpret that correctly, it means that
if we have an article on which there is a
price support in CanadaHon. Mr. Haig: Butter.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, butter.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, let us take cheese or
butter as an illustration. This bill, whose
main purpose is to prohibit the export of
strategic materials into the Iron Curtain
countries, empowers the department under
the section just quoted, to establish a list
of prohibitions on imports, if in the judgment
of the powers that be such imports interfere
with the prices of articles that have price
support. Quite frankly, I think that is mixing up strategic materials with other things
in a manner that should not be approved. At

any rate, it is a point upon which I hope we
shall get some information when the bill goes
to committee.
The other powers conferred by the bill, it
seems to me, are quite reasonable. I am
wholly in sympathy with the purpose and
intent of the bill as stated by our colleague
the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. MacKinnon); since surely we must be
careful about exporting such things as uranium, copper, lead, and a multiude of other
materials that can be used for the effective
prosecution of a war.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What about barley and
oats?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should think this
measure is wide enough in construction to
include barley and oats.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is of wide construction now.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: One of the things I object
to is that the powers conferred by the bill are
much wider than are necessary for the control of export of strategic materials, and I
wish to make an observation that is general
in its application. Ever since the outbreak
of the Second World War there has been a
tendency to grant powers to the executive
which, fifty years ago, parliament would not
have thought of granting.
Hon. Mr. King: That is because of changed
conditions.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I do not think it is
because of changed conditions entirely. It
started during the first war.
Hon. Mr. King: Yes, that was when conditions changed.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But the two wars are
over. It is true that in time of war it was
convenient and necessary for the government
to legislate upon matters that it did not need
to bring before parliament. The War Measures Act was operative during the Second
World War. Since then we, and certainly
parliament, have believed that emergencies
existed, and wide controls have been granted
to the administration. One can see that in a
dozen pieces of legislation which parliament
bas passed. All I am now saying, honourable
senators, is that this is a matter of very
considerable importance, because it is quite
possible to get democratic people habituated
to this kind of legislation. Speaking in a
general sense, it is vitally important that the
individual units in a democracy have always
before them a clear and conscious understanding of, and a confidence and belief in,
the value of freedom and liberty.

MARCH 25, 1954
Before concluding my remarks I should like
to say something about the question of penalties. I of course agree that the penalties
should be stiff, and I have no doubt the proposals in that respect are proper. Further, I
realize that it is almost impossible to prevent
the movement of goods, even strategic materials, to areas behind the Iron Curtain. For
instance, an exporter in Canada may in good
faith sell to an importer in Sweden a product
classed as strategic material, and the Swedish
importer may surreptitiously, or in some
fashion, get it behind the Iron Curtain. Such
a movement of goods is extremely difficult to
prevent, for there are always some people
willing to violate a law if they think they can
get away with it and make a profit.
Section 20 of the bill makes it an offenceand here again I am in difficulty because of
my unfamiliarity with legal interpretationsfor any person to knowingly take part in any
action that might lead to strategic goods
reaching areas behind the Iron Curtain. If
the exporter in Canada, of which I spoke a
moment ago, suspected that, for example, the
ball bearings that he was shipping to Sweden
were going behind the Iron Cutrain, and if, in
the wording of that section, he fails "to exercise due diligence to prevent the commission
of such an offence", he is liable to a penalty.
What is meant by "due diligence"? I confess
I do not know. If a charge under this legislation becomes the subject of a court proceeding, I presume an interpretation will be made
by the judicial authorities.
Before I resume my seat, honourable senators, let me make my position quite clear.
I am not opposed to this legislation; indeed,
I think it is necessary legislation. I simply
have attempted to draw the attention of the
house to a few of the features of the bill
which I think we should have clearly in mind
before we give it second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
EASTERN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH
COMPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill J-13, an Act respecting
Eastern Telephone and Telegraph Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill now
before us would amend the act of incorporation of the Eastern Telephone and Telegraph
Company, which was passed in 1917. The
authorized capital stock of the company at
83280-26

the date of incorporation was $10 million,
divided into shares of $100 each. In 1929 all
the stock was acquired by American Telephone and Telegraph Company; therefore,
this company is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company.
At the time of the acquisition of the stock
by the American company, it was intended
to construct a single-panel telephone cable;
but in 1931 the project was suspended, and
since that time Eastern Telephone and Telegraph Company has remained inactive. Consequently, the company's act of incorporation
was amended by a special act of parliament
in the session of 1931, by which the company was authorized to reduce its capital by
by-law, a copy of which was to be filed with
the Secretary of State.
More recently a four-party agreement was
entered into to bring the Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company into active operation. On November 27, 1953, an agreement
was effected between Her Majesty's Postmaster General in the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, and Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company. The agreement
provided for .the construction, at a cost of
approximately $35 million, of a cable extending from Oban, Scotland, to Clarenville,
Newfoundland, thence to Sydney Mines,
Nova Scotia, and by radio relay from Sydney
Mines to Portland and New York. This plan
has been approved, and arrangements have
been entered into to finance the construction.
I want to be as brief as I can, honourable
senators, but I think it is important to note
that it is becoming more and more necessary
to have a submarine telephone cable communication system serving the United States,
Canada and Great Britain. It is with this in
mind that the three countries have agreed
to lay this submarine cable which, by the
way, will contain thirty-six circuits and will
provide for the carrying on of thirty-six
conversations at the same time. Communication through the cable will not be subject
to the defects inherent in telephonic communication through radio facilities. I refer
to the fact that radio-telephonic communication is largely dependent on prevailing
atmospheric conditions.
The distance to be covered between the
two mainlands, that is, between Nova
Scotia and Scotland, is 2,200 miles.
The capital stock to be issued will be
owned fifty per cent by American Telephone
and Telegraph Company, forty-one per cent

SENATE
by the British Post Office Department, and
nine per cent by our own Department
of Transport, represented by the crown
organization known as the Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation.
Section 1 of the bill provides that the
capital stock of Eastern Telephone and Telegraph Company shall be five million dollars
divided into shares of one hundred dollars
each.
Section 2 repeals the present section 5 of
the act and substitutes a new section 5, which
reads:
(1) The number of the directors shall be not less
than five nor more than nine, one or more of whom
may be paid directors.
(2) A quorum at any meeting of the directors
shall consist of such number of directors as may
be required by the bylaws of the company, said
number in no event to be less than one-third of the
directors.

It is interesting to note that the Maritime
Telegraph and Telephone Company at Halifax
will be connected with the Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company, as will the New
Brunswick Telephone Company, of which my
honourable friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) is a director. Both of
these companies will have representation on
the board of directors of Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
I would suggest, honourable senators, that
if this bill is given second reading it be
referred to the Committee on Transport and
Communications. I will be very pleased to
place before the committee fuller information
as to financing and the terms of the agreement which I mentioned, involving the three
countries, the United Kingdom, the United
States and Canada, and which was signed
on November 27, 1953.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Did I understand the
honourable gentleman to say that the three
countries party to this agreement-the United
Kingdom, the United States and Canada-are
represented, in the case of the United Kingdom, by a department of government; in the
case of the United States, by a private corporation; and in the case of Canada, by a
Crown company? Is that correct?

Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is correct. Perhaps
I should repeat. The first party to the agreement is Her Majesty's Postmaster General
in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland; and the third party, the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, is a Crown corporation which comes
under the jurisdiction of the Department of
Transport. The other parties to the agreement are the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company. I may say to the
honourable senator my understanding is that
the head office of the organization will be
maintained in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if a majority of the stock will be
held in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. He said it will be held
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: As I stated, the original
bill of incorporation covered the Eastern
Telephone and Telegraph Company, which
was a wholly Canadian company.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And it sold out to a company in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It was not possible to carry
on in 1917, and the company was inactive
for many years. The authorized issue of stock
was reduced to $75,000. Later, with a view
to making it active again, it was taken over
by the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company, and if this bill passes that conpany will own fifty per cent of the stock,
while the remaining fifty per cent will be
divided between Canada and the United
Kingdom.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
FIRST READING

83280-26j

SENATE
For many years I enjoyed the friendship of
the late Captain Bernier, that great Arctic
explorer and navigator, who did wonderful
work in our far north country. He raised the
Canadian ensign in many northern sections,
some of them very close to the North Pole.
He was very enthusiastic as to the potentially
large fisheries that could be carried on in the
cold northern waters, and I was particularly
impressed by what he said as to the mining
prospects in the so-called barren lands. Gold
has been a tremendous factor in the development of Northern Canada, and it must always
be borne in mind that in the Porcupine area
and in other sections of the province of
Quebec, most of the new mines will be
developed where the land will never be
densely populated. For that reason alone, the
provincial governments and -the federal government must realize the necessity of doing
everything possible to ensure transportation
and road facilities wherever needed for
development. Honourable senators will remember that, only last fall, considerable publicity was given to the possibility of discovering oil in the James Bay basin. The Ontario
government, through the Honourable Philip
T. Kelly, Minister of Mines devoted a lot of
attention to it, and prospectors and promoters
have been encouraged to go there to see if
oil production could be developed in that
section of the province, and honest efforts at
development have been assured of full
assistance.
Of course, the Pre-Cambrian Shield, which
extends over the greater part of Northern
Canada, is well known by our geologists to
contain greater mineral wealth than any
other part of the world. Through the years
gold, nickel, copper, silver and many other
kinds of precious and base metals, have
been found in that section.
I do not propose to go to any great length
in asking for the support of the Senate for
this legislation, because I feel the need for it
is generally recognized. In my section of
Ontario-the northern section, which, geographically speaking, is central Canadawe always take a very broad view of problems of other provinces, whether they have
to do with maritime rights, or western freight
rates. For instance, when a few years ago
the parliament of Canada voted $65 million
to be paid to the western grain farmers, the
people of northern Ontario approved of it.
They said, in effect: "The farmers of the
West deserve this, because of the magnificent
job they did during the war years in producing grain and selling it at a fair price to the
nations allied with us in the great struggle."

This legislation was announced by the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister on October
7, 1953, and honourable senators are no
doubt familiar with it. The former legislation
for assisting gold mines expired on December
31 last year, and the present bill provides
for extension of the legislation to the year
1954; in other words, this measure would continue in force the 1953 formula for assistance
to gold mines.
As has been pointed out in the other house,
the problems which have faced the gold mining industry in the past still exist. I would
hope that this will be the last year for which
it will be necessary to extend the application
of this legislation. but if the present situation
does not change, assistance will have to be
continued. Passage of this measure now,
however, will render to the gold mining communities assistance which will enable them
to plan their operations with a greater degree
of certainty for this year.
Legislation of this type brings to mind the
question of subsidies. Although as a matter
of general principle I must say that I am
against subsidies, there have been times in
the history of Canada when I have felt they
were absolutely necessary. That was particularly true during World War I and World
War II, when subsidies were placed on many
basic commodities such as-to name just a
few-milk, cheese, butter, bread, tea and
coffee. Yet, when the time came to withdraw
those subsidies, I was glad to see them go,
for subsidies have the unhappy faculty of
obscuring to some extent the true value of
commodities and their actual cost of production. While people are pleased when prices
of goods remain constant during an emergency
period, they do not bother to take the trouble
to study the true picture behind the application of subsidies.
When the question of subsidies te assist
the gold mining industry first came up, I
was then a member of the other house, and
I told that branch of parliament that, based
upon the experience of the district which I
had the honour to represent, existing conditions warranted assistance to the industry. It
seems to me paradoxical, if not ironical, that
gold, which is synonymous with wealth or
opulence, should require assistance in its
production. Gold is different from any other
metal produced in this country. It is the
only metal universally accepted for monetary
purposes, and by reason of that fact it plays
a major part in the national economy of many
nations.
How has the price of gold fluctuated over
the past twenty-four years? In 1931 the
Government of Canada asked gold producers

MARCH 30, 1954
to send all their gold to the Mint, and by the
Gold Export Act of 1932 gold mining companies were compelled to comply with that
request. That was done at the time when
Britain went off the gold standard, and when
the price of gold was just over $20 an ounce.
Bear in mind that this was in the year 1932.
During the period from 1930 to 1933 the
average price of gold increased each year,
until in 1933 it reached $28.60 an ounce. In
January 1934 the United States Government
proclaimed a price of $35 per ounce. This
was the maximum price that Canadian purchasers could obtain, regardless of the effect
of supply of or demand for gold on the
world market. While all other metals and
commodities have increase in price tremendously since 1941, the price of gold bas
remained rigidly pegged.
The stock argument used against the
demand for an increase in the price of gold
is that an increase would have an inflationary
effect. May I elaborate on that statement
for a few moments? I took it upon myself
on two different occasions to go to Washington to consult some high officials of the
United States Treasury about what would
happen if the price of gold were to follow
the upward trend of other metals. We all
know how other metals have increased in
price since 1940. However, the stock answer
which I have received on nearly all occasions
was that an increase in the price of gold
would be inflationary. My reply was that
while that might be so, the great increases
allowed in the prices of other commodities
during the same period of time were also
inflationary. No one will deny that the price
of steel bas risen tremendously since 1940,
as have the prices of copper, tea and coffee;
and the prices of even our own agricultural
products have gone up in some cases by
more than 100 per cent. Newsprint is another
product whose price bas increased to a large
degree. But no one can say that this general
increase in prices bas upset the economy of
countries on this side of the Iron Curtain.
True, we are now experiencing a certain
degree of inflation, but I am sincerely convinced that if the United States Treasury
decided to raise the price of gold by, let us
say, $10 an ounce, it would not have any
great effect so far as inflation is concerned.
I personally believe that gold should be
selling at $50 an ounce, or thereabouts, but
if tomorrow its price were increased by even
$10 an ounce, it would have a good effect on
this country. Immediately there would open
up in northern Ontario and Quebec, and in
other sections of northern Canada as well,
at least a hundred new gold mining centres,

to be followed by other mining development.
That would be a marvellous boost to our
national econcmy at the present time.
I repeat, that if an increase in the price of
gold would be inflationary, it is also true
that all other price increases have beer
inflationary in their effect. Gold is needed
in the monetary system, and in my opinion
its price should follow the general trend of
prices and be increased by $10 to $15 an
ounce.
A few years ago the late lamented Miss
Agnes MacPhail, who was then a member
of the House of Commons was invited to
speak at the high school commencement
exercises in that very fine town of northern
Ontario, Timmins. I recall that she began
her speech with the remark, which was sincerely meant, that she was glad to be meeting these fine people of the gold-mining
section of the province; that they were
thrifty, industrious, and able to extract from
the solid rock a certain amount of gold which
eventually was buried in the vaults of Fort
Knox, in the United States, where it was of
no use. The chairman of the meeting was the
mayor of the town, and it happened that his
name was Mr. George Drew; I believe he
was related to the present Leader of the
Opposition in the House of Commons.
He said in effect, "It is true that the
gold which is produced in this section
does not stay here; there is not sufficient
room for it in our vaults. But I understand that our visitor comes from an important tobacco-growing section of our province;
and that the tobacco produced is not kept
there, but is sent away and turned into
smoke; but the people who raise it make
money out of it." What he meant was that
for everything which is produced, there is
some use.
Gold is the commodity which backs our
Canadian dollars; it also serves a useful purpose in the International Monetary Fund,
because paper money issued by the Fund
must be backed to the extent of at least 25
per cent by gold. It is my understanding
also that our Canadian currency requires a
gold backing of from 10 to 25 per cent. I do
not know what is the ratio of gold to paper
in the United States, but it is well known
that paper currency, unless backed by a
certain amount of gold, could not be acceptable. So the statement that the gold purchased by the United States goes there to be
buried is only. relatively true. My information, from a source which I believe to be
reliable, is that the use of gold money in
North Africa, Sardinia, and southern Italy
during the last war was a means of saving

SENATE
the lives of many of our young soldiers. We
know that at the present time the great
republie to the south buys large quantities
of crude oil from the Arab states, and that
much of their payment is made in gold,
because the Arabs will not accept paper
currency.
Evidently, therefore, gold must perform a
real function. Honourable senators probably
noticed that only a week ago a dozen or
more traders in Great Britain opened offices
to buy and sell gold on the European open
market.
So, if gold has a place in the world's
economy, if it-rather than, for instance, wool
or sheep-is necessary as the backing of the
paper money of the democracies, surely it
should be so priced that the producers may
count upon a reasonable return. It must be
recognized that for the economy of the
United States the gold-mining industry has
less importance than for our own or that of
South Africa. But I am certain that, were
the case reversed, and gold production in the
United States was, comparatively speaking,
as important as it is here, the price of the
metal would have been increased some time
ago.
I wish now to cite some facts as to the
service which the gold-mining industry has
given this country. Early in the last war,
because of our great need for American
dollars, the Canadian government requested
the gold-mining industry to increase production; and although the producers had to face
such handicaps as restricted supplies and
shortage of equipment and of manpower,
they responded magnificiently. There was no
hesitation of any kind. They knew it was
necessary that the country should obtain
more United States dollars.
In 1942, when our government placed the
Canadian dollar at par with the American
dollar, our money at that time being at a
discount of 10 per cent, there resulted an
immediate loss of $3.50 on each ounce of gold
produced in Canada. On the evening of the
day the parity announcement was made by
the Minister of Finance, I received a telephone inquiry from one of our larger newsprint mills, located in the centre of my
riding, as to what would be the effect upon
the industry. I replied that there was no need
for worry, because no doubt the price of
newsprint and sulphite would be increased,
that it would follow the trend of other commodity prices, but that the price of gold
would be stabilized; and therefore, instead
of receiving $38.50, they would get only $35.
I recall that my colleague from the Kirkland
Lake section-whose name I believe I am in

order in mentioning; it was Mr. Walter
Little-was, like me, worried over the situation. I realized that the move would create
some commotion, some concern, in the industry, but I felt that it was our duty to go
to our respective ridings in the north country
and tell our people that if the measure was
good for the national economy as a whole,
it should be accepted by the gold-mining
industry. To their credit be it said that it
was accepted with no criticism at all from
the gold producers of Canada; and ever since
labour and management have accomplished
great things for the survival of the industry.
It should also be remembered that gold
mining requires, if it is to continue to exist,
constant improvements in methods of production, including the most up-to-date
machinery. Any honourable senators who
have visited the mines in the northern sections of Quebec, Ontario, and other parts of
Canada will have seen, both on the surface
and underground, large areas equipped with
all kinds of machinery, but with only one
or two persons in charge of a great many
machines. This serves to show the extent
and rapidity of the mechanization which has
taken place during the past few years; and
without it, many mines would not be
operating today.
There is a further disadvantage from
which the industry bas greatly suffered. The
price received for an ounce of gold not only
remained the same, namely $35, in the
equivalent of American dollars, but, following the premium position which our dollar
attained in relation to the American dollar,
the operators have constantly received inferior prices, so that, on the average, an
ounce of gold yielded $34.27 in 1952, $34.45
in 1953, and was as low as $33.76 in February
of last year.
Perhaps it will be in order for me to say
at this stage that the existing act was given
the royal assent on May 14, 1948, and put
into force during the years 1948, 1949 and
1950. It was afterwards amended in 1951,
1952 and 1953; and, as stated previously, it
lapsed on December 31 last.
There are only two main markets for our
gold. The United States Treasury, which is
practically our only outlet at the present time,
accepts it at 35 United States dollars per
ounce.
On the other hand, the producers may
elect to sell their gold on the open market.
However, a mine selling on the open market
is not eligible for assistance under this act.
So far this year only one mine bas elected
to sell on the free market, as against five
in 1953 and thirteen in 1952.

MARCH 30, 1954
Increased assistance in 1953, if continued
through the present year, should be regarded
as a special measure of assistance to gold
mines caught between rising costs of production and a flxed mint price for their products.
In this connection it must be realized that
Canadian gold mines are deeply affected by
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar in
terms of the American dollar. For example,
for the greater part of the period during
which the Canadian dollar has been at a
premium, our mines have received a steadily
decreasing rate for their products. This legislation can be regarded as designed to compensate for these factors, and thereby to help
in preserving the modern communities which
are dependent on gold production. No one
will deny that gold mining is a depressed
industry, for the record shows that of a total
of 140 gold mines operating before the war,
fewer than sixty are operating today. Many
of these owe their existence to the Emergency
Gold Mining Assistance Act.
It must also be realized that no new lode
gold mines commenced operating in Canada
during the past year, whereas five Ontario
mines had to close down during that period.
Four of these mines had exhausted their
ore, and the fifth could no longer carry out
its operations economically. It is feared that
two or three more mines may not be able
to continue operating at a profit.
Both the volume and value of Canadian gold
production declined in 1953. The total value
of gold production from all mines in Canada
during 1953, in round figures, was $140 million, and in 1952 it was $152 million. In
1953 production reached 4,061,205 ounces,
compared with 4,471,725 ounces in 1952. In
1953, 467,356 ounces were produced in base
metal mines which received no assistance, and
3,593,849 ounces were produced in gold mines.
It can also be correctly stated that an appreciable amount of the decrease in production in 1953 was attributable to mine strikes.
There was a decrease in base metal production during the strike.at the Noranda mines,
but I say in all sincerity that it is encouraging
to know that these labour disputes in the
industry have now been settled. I hope that
in the future the mine workers and management will be able to get together and reach
a satisfactory agreement before irreparable
damage is done.
During the calendar year 1953 the government paid out the sum of $8,257,112.78 in
emergency assistance to gold mines. This
amount was paid out to the end of December,
1953, but does not include applications for
the fourth quarter of that year or hold-backs
or applications not yet received. Some of

these applications are now being received by
the department and payments are still being
made on applications for 1953. It is anticipated that the total payment for the calendar
year 1953 will approximate about $15 million.
Since this act came into force, the government has paid out, in round figures, nearly
$62 million in subsidies to the gold-mining
industry.
Although gold mining industry is carried
on only in certain sections of Canada, the
industry is a very important one. I am
positive that the Canadian taxpayer, knowing of its importance, is not willing to sacrifice
this industry, and that parliament has kept
this legislation on the statute books in the
last few years because the people want it
kept there.
The gold mining problem concerns not only
the gold mining industry, nor only the provinces having gold mines. It does not interest
only the towns of Kirkland Lake, Timmins
and the Red Lake section of Ontario; Malartic, Val d'Or and Duparquet in Quebec,
Ogama-Rockland and Snow Lake in Manitoba, Bralorne, Hedley and Wells in British
Columbia, Dawson and Yellowknife in the
Yukon, and the country of the Mackenzie
River. It is a problem that concerns all of
Canada and all Canadians.
When gold
receives the same consideration in the matter
of price as do other metals, it will truly be a
great day for Canada, for I have no doubt
that new flourishing centres of population
will be established in many parts of the
north country.
On March 22 Premier Frost of Ontario
announced the formation of a three-man factfinding committee to study the province's
ailing gold industry. I am sure that this
statement
was received with welcome
throughout all of Canada and particularly in
Northern Ontario. This committee, which
will be headed by a prominent Canadian,
Professor F. A. Knox, of Queen's University,
will examine and report upon the following:
1. The condition affecting the present position of
and prospects for the gold mining industry.
2. The underlying trends in employment, wages,
working conditions, profits and dividends in the
industry.
3. The effects of these developments on communities in the northern parts of the province.

I think the criticism is unwarranted that
these subsidies are for the purposes of enabling gold mines to pay bigger dividends.
Investors in gold stock are fortunate to
receive more than l or 2 per cent on their
investment. More money is lost in gold stock
ventures than is made, and this has certainly
been my personal experience. I should like
to cite one case in point where the impression

SENATE
has been created that mine owners and management try to use most of the subsidies they
receive to increase their own profits. Let us
take the Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines
Limited, the largest gold mine on a tonnage
basis on the North American continent. Since
the commencement of the system of paying
bonuses, this mine has increased its wages
by $16,365,527 while accepting $11,430,656
from the government in the way of emergency
gold mining assistance. In other words, the
mine paid out in wages nearly $5 million over
and above the assistance it received from the
government.
I could give other similar
illustrations.
I should like to take just a few minutes to
describe what the mines are really doing. In
very few cases have the management not
always been above reproach; all in all, they
have done a good job. Gold mining is not an
easy enterprise. For one thing, there is no
placer gold. Some bodies of ore are of such a
low grade that the mine operators have tremendous obstacles to surmount before they
even get started.
Practically all the mining companies provide benefits in varying degrees. I am going
to enumerate some of those given by the
Hollinger Gold Mines:
1. Since 1937 an employee has been able
to join a medical association which provides
medical services, hospitalization, surgery and
certain drugs. The company pays approximately 20 per cent of the cost; the rest is paid
by the employee.
2. All employees are covered by sickness
and accident insurance, which plan was
started in 1937. At present an employee
receives $20 per week for a maximum of 13
weeks and $15 per week for a maximum of
six weeks during an absence resulting from
non-occupational sickness and accidents. The
cost is borne entirely by the company.
3. A savings plan was started in April 1934.
An employee may now deposit a maximum of
$12 per period. If he does, the company
will contribute $4 per month. The money is
placed on deposit with an insurance company
and earns interest semi-annually.
The
employee may draw the total accumulation
on termination of employment.
4. Each employee receives from $750 to
$2,250 life insurance, depending upon length
of employment. The maximum is reached
at the end of five years. The cost is borne
entirely by the company.
5. Supplementary Retirement Payments.
Under certain circumstances an employee is
eligible to receive payments upon retirement
which would equal the amount he and the

company would have contributed to the savings plan had it been in operation prior to
the year 1934. This is paid entirely by the
company.
The total cost of the company contributions to these plans during 1952 amounted
to approximately 5 cents per hour for each
hour worked.
In the mines where the employees have
chosen to bargain through a union, complete
collective agreements have been signed providing for satisfactory grievance procedures
and ensuring the rights of individual
employees.
I am not going to enlarge on what the
McIntyre Mines Ltd. has done to cure silicosis. Great work is still being done under the
sponsorship of the University of Toronto.
Large sums of money have been spent and
remarkable strides made in that direction.
Last week-end I visited the towns of Rouyn
and Noranda, and on Saturday afternoon I
attended a hockey match played in a magnificent arena at Noranda. The secretary told me
the building cost $1,500,000. I asked him if
it was paid for by the people of the two
towns, and he said, "No; this fine centre of
amusement was given by Noranda Mines
Limited". Several instances of that kind
could be cited, and if they were better known
many people would realize that management
and owner are not always trying to get
the last "pound of flesh", but seek to co-operate with the workers and the people generally, and are interested in their welfare.
The miners are familiar with these situations
and appreciate them.

FIRE LOSSES REPLACEMENT ACCOUNT
BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill 377, an Act to establish an
account for the replacement of government
property lost, destroyed or damaged through
fire.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
both short and simple, and although it deals
with the question of loss or damage to public
property through fire, I do not think it has
any hidden or undesirable implications. Its
purpose is to add to the present long list of
public accounts, an account in which expenditures for replacement of government
property lost, destroyed or damaged through
fire may be charged. Up to now no such
facility has existed in our public accounting
system. If a government building or property
suffered damage resulting from fire and had
to be replaced or repaired at once in order
that important public service might be
resumed as quickly as possible, the financing
of the work had to be arranged in one of
two ways. The department of government so
affected might use some of the current
appropriation included in its estimates, in
which case some other planned objective
would be postponed; or, the department involved might arrange to raise the money
required by special warrant through the
Governor in Council. Otherwise, the repair
or replacement would be delayed from six
to twelve months, or at least until such time
as a new appropriation could be made.
This bill seeks to provide for such contingencies by setting up, under clause 5, an
account to be known as the Fire Losses
Replacement Account. Advances out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund provided for in
clause 4 will be charged against this account.
Clause 6 of the bill provides that such
charges shall be deleted from this new
account within the same fiscal period as the

expenditure is made, if an appropriation is
made available to cover the required
expenditure.
If repayment within the year is not possible, clause 7 provides that all advances in
a fiscal year for expenditure under clause 4,
not charged against appropriations for that
fiscal year, shall be included in estimates for
the following year submitted by the appropriate minister, and shall be then charged
against the expenditure in question. In other
words, the charges will be deleted from the
account to be set up under this bill, as the
amounts required for repairs and replacements are attended to out of the estimates
from the departments in question in the
following year.
The limit of the amount represented by
this account will be $5 million, as provided
in clause 8 of the bill.
Clause 9 simply deals with regulations
which may be made by the Treasury Board,
whose duty it will be to carry out the purposes and provisions of this act.
This bill is under the sponsorship of the
Minister of Finance, but its administration
really comes under the Treasury Board, and
any appropriate minister on the Treasury
Board is mentioned in this bill as a responsible minister in relation to his department.
This legislation received scant attention in
the House of Commons. There was not much
discussion on it, because it was regarded as a
sensible measure; but two questions were
asked, the answers to which were given by
the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister
of Finance, who handled this legislation. In
answer to a question raised about fire prevention advice in connection with properties
owned and controlled by the federal government, it was pointed out that there is an
official known as the Dominion Fire Commissioner for Canada, Mr. C. A. Thomson,
who is responsible to the Superintendent of
Insurance; and that it is the duty of the
commissioner to give advice with regard to
precautions to be taken against fire hazards
in public buildings, and to see that his advice
is carried out by those in charge of government buildings. The second question was in
connection with the administration of this
account and its reporting to parliament.
The charges to the Fire Losses Replacement
Account as proposed in this bill will be fully
set forth each year in the annual report on
Public Accounts as presented to parliament.
The legislation will provide a new and more
convenient method of dealing with losses as
they occur, without any unnecessary waste of
time. As an example of what will be accomplished under this bill, one might refer to

MARCH 30, 1954
the fire damage suffered by the Library of
Parliament. The administration of this building comes under the Prime Minister's office,
and unless there were funds available in the
Prime Minister's estimates that could be
devoted to the rehabilitation of the library,
it would be necessary-as in this case it was
necessary-to wait for a long period of time
to get the estimates voted for the rehabilitation work which is now going on and which
will take at least two years to finish. Under
this legislation it will be possible to draw
immediately on the account which will carry
a maximum balance of $5 million, and any
amount expended will be replaced later when
the estimates for the following year are being
prepared.
That is really all I need to say about the
bill. I have attempted to give in brief the
substance of what was said about it in the
other house. I am not going to suggest that
it be referred to committee unless someone
wants to have that done.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I have
just one remark to make: that is, that this bill
certainly is a step in the right direction, and
one that has been long overdue. Although the
bill is designed to cover fire hazards I wonder
whether the word "flood" should not be added
to it, because buildings can be destroyed by
flood as well as by fire. I was about to
suggest that if it is sent to committee that
aspect might well be considered. At any rate,
in the future I hope that the government will
give serious consideration to providing for
replacement or repair of its other property as
well as buildings. I believe that this bill will
serve a great need in the event of fire, but
personally I would like to see it applied to
damage or destruction by fiood also.
In Hell's Gate canyon there are fisheries
installations which cost more than a million
dollars; it is quite conceivable that unprecedented fioods could take thern away, and we
might not be able to replace them until an
appropriation was voted. I think provision
should be made for replacement in cases of
that kind. However, as I say, this bill is a
step in the right direction.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think the suggestion
made by the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is quite proper.
However, I might point out that there could
be damage by cyclone as well.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, a building could be
wrecked in that way, too.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Up to about twenty
years ago the Dominion Government carried
insurance on its properties. At that time the
practice was changed: the government started

to do away with a great many forms of insurance that it had formerly carried, and proceeded to insure its own buildings by means
of bookkeeping entries. There has never
been any special account from which immediate withdrawals could be made for repair or
replacement of buildings damaged or lost
through fire or any other cause.
I would suggest that the bill be given
second reading now, and that before it is
passed the point of enlarging its scope to
include these other items might be discussed
with the appropriate department to see if the
amendment would be in order.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is it intended to have the
bill sent to committee?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I had not intended to
move that it be referred to committee, but I
will do so if further information is desired.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: One or two matters have
occurred to me in connection with this proposed legislation. To the principle I see no
particular objection, but it might be useful
to send it to committee where we could
ascertain what, for instance, is the practice
in protecting property of crown corporations.
I notice by the bill that crown corporations
may be brought under this legislation by a
regulation of the Treasury Board. There
are now a considerable number of crown
corporations, and it might be useful, as well
as informative, to find out whether they
carry their own insurance; and if so, to what
extent. Do some of them forgo insurance?
I think questions of this order would be
pertinent to this bill. Again, will the bill
involve the setting up of a new organization
for administrative purposes, or will the Department of Finance administer it? Usually,
in the past, when an emergent need arose for
spending money to replace
structures
destroyed by fire, the Governor in Council
would pass what is known as a Governor
General's warrant, which constituted authority
to proceed with the necessary reconstruction.
Of course, approval of the warrant had to
be obtained at the next sitting of parliament.
I suggest that it would be both useful
and enlightening to get some information on
the points I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I might say for the
benefit of my honourable friend that property
of crown companies, like any other government property, is not insured. All this information was brought out during the discussion in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What place?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The House of Commons.
No new organization is required; the administration comes under Treasury Board; and
all that is involved in this bill is another
simple account, with a credit limited to
$5 million.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Why the limit?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, that is the limit,
because not more than $5 million will be
needed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I hope not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The explanation on this
point in the other house was that the replacement of any advance from the fund would
presumably take place in the same fiscal
year, from the vote received by the department, or if not, in the following year; so
that, the charge being deleted from the
account, it would be a rotating account, to
be operated in relation to the department
affected by fire. The estimates for the following year would make provision for any
amount which had been temporarily provided through this contingent account. The
matter is purely one of bookkeeping, and it
will require no increase of staff or additional
organization.
If the honourable senator
wants any confirmation on these matters it
can readily be obtained at a meeting of the
Banking and Commerce Committee. The
committee is going to meet, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I certainly do not wish
to delay the passing of the bill, but I recall
that in one crown corporation alone-the
Polymer Corporation-something between
fifteen and twenty million dollars is invested.
If overnight the Polymer Corporation plant
were wiped out by fire and-as I gather from
the remarks of the honourable senator who
has just spoken-there is no insurance to
cover that contingency, $5 million would not
be sufficient to reconstruct it. It may be that
I am tilting at windmills, but I think it
would be useful to have in committee some
information on the matters I have mentioned.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
BALOISE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY OF
CANADA, LIMITED-SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Vien moved the second reading of Bill L-13, an Act to incorporate Baloise
Fire Insurance Company of Canada, Limited.

He said: Honourable senators, the promoters of this company are enumerated in
section 1 of the bill. The name of the
company will be Baloise Fire Insurance Company of Canada, Limited, and in French,
La Bâloise, Compagnie d'Assurance contre
l'Incendie au Canada. The head office will
be at Montreal. The capital stock of the
company will be $1 million, and the company
will have the right to commence business
upon having subscribed a paid-up capital
of $500,000. As soon as half a million dollars
have been subscribed and paid up, the company will have the right to commence business in certain types of insurance.
The types of insurance which the company
will have the right to undertake are enumerated in section 6. It will not be empowered to carry out all these types of
insurance as soon as $500,000 has been subscribed but will be limited-in the main-to
fire insurance, accident insurance, automobile
insurance, guarantee insurance, and theft insurance; and in addition thereto, civil commotion insurance, hail insurance, impact by
vehicles insurance, sprinkler leakage insurance, water damage insurance, weather and
windstorm insurance, but only in relation to
the property already insured by the company
against fire.
To be able to carry on all types of insurance
enumerated under section 6, the company
will require to have either a capital of
$1 million subscribed and paid up, or a
capital of $500,000 subscribed and paid up,
plus a certain amount of money, as provided
under section 7, for each type of insurance
therein designated. For instance, to conduct
aircraft insurance, boiler insurance, excluding machinery, credit insurance, forgery insurance, live stock insurance or machinery
insurance, the paid capital, or the paid capital
together with the surplus, shall be increased
by an amount of not less than $40,000 in
respect of each of those classes. To conduct
earthquake insurance, falling aircraft insurance, impact by vehicles insurance, and
sprinkler leakage insurance, the additional
amount in respect of each class shall be not
less than $10,000.
To conduct marine insurance, an additional amount of not less
than $100,000 will be required; for plate glass
insurance, an additional amount of not less
than $20,000; and for windstorm insurance,
an additional amount of $50,000.
There is a Swiss company, with headquarters in Switzerland, which carries on
business in Canada. The purpose of this
incorporation is to acquire the property and
to assume the obligations of this company in

MARCH 30, 1954
Canada. This Swiss company has been incorporated under six different names-actually, it is the same name translated into
six different languages. In English it is
known as Baloise Fire Insurance Company, Limited, but in France the word
Limitée is omitted because the French insurance laws do not permit use of this word.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Where are the headquarters
of the company?
Hon. Mr. Vien: The headquarters of the
Swiss company are in Basle, Switzerland,
but the headquarters of the new Canadian
company will be located in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has this bill the approval
of the Superintendent of Insurance?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes. If the bill is given
second reading, I will move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where its promoters will
be able to furnish honourable senators with
detailed information.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
SUSPENSION OF RULE

Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, it is
desirable to have this bill referred to committee promptly before the Easter adjournment, as otherwise it might not get over to
the House of Commons in time for consideration this session. If we proceeded in the
usual course, one week's notice of the sitting
of the committee would be required, under
Rule 119, and in this instance that would
cause an undue delay. With leave of the
Senate, I would therefore move:
That Rule 119 be suspended in so far as it relates
to the Bill L-13, intituled: "An act to incorporate
Baloise Fire
Insurance Company
of Canada,
Limited".

The motion was agreed to.

THE LATE SENATOR JONES
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, we were all deeply shocked at noon
today when we heard of the very sudden

fact that this is the last day of the fiscal year
and we expect to receive the Royal Assent
to certain bills this afternoon, I would suggest that the house should now adjourn.
However, as the urgency of the business
before us prevents our taking that course,
may I suggest that we rise at this time for
a few moments in memory of our deceased
colleague, and that oral tributes to him be
paid tomorrow.
Honourable senators rose and stood in

The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, to whom was referred the Bill (J-13),
intituled: "An Act respecting Eastern Telephone

petitions for divorce, and moved that the
said reports be taken into consideration at
the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, may I take
advantage of this opportunity to make a short
report on the proceedings of the Divorce
Committee and to give some facts which I
think will interest the house at this time?
There have been filed in all, this session,
462 petitions for divorce, which I am informed
is the largest docket that has ever come
before the committee. Of these, 14 were withdrawn, leaving 448 petitions to be heard. To
date 372 petitions have been heard and
recommended, and three heard and rejected,
leaving 73 still to be dealt with.
In January the committee passed a resolution extending to March 1 the time within
which the rules of the Senate should be fully
complied with in the preparation of cases
for hearing at this session, but of the 73
pending petitions only 12 were fully completed by that date. The remaining 61 have
therefore to be put over for hearing at the
next session.
Of the 12 petitions that are ready to be
heard this session, six are opposed; but our
information is that two of the opposed cases
will not proceed. The probability is that this
session we shall hear 10 more cases, four
of which will be opposed.
As we prepare to adjourn for the Easter
recess, the committee is in a position to say
that it has completed practically all of its
work for this session.
I wish to add a word of commendation to
my colleagues on the committee for their
faithful attendance at its meetings, and for
the facility and good judgment with which
they have handled the work of the committee.
I say that with particular sincerity, because
of the disability under which I have laboured
during the past month or two, when the committee carried on so successfully in the
absence of the chairman. I should say a
special word of thanks to those who substituted for me as chairman, and who pardoned
my absence on a number of occasions. I
congratulate all the members of the committee upon the splendid service that they
have rendered.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

ACCOUNT BILL

interim supply bill of the kind which comes
up annually about this time of the year.
Its purpose, of course, is to finance the public
service for approximately the first two months
of the new fiscal year which will begin
tomorrow.

I notice that it is not usual, upon second
reading of this class of bill, to refer to the
sections, but I think that probably there is
no other way in which the bill can be

handled at this stage.
By section 2 it is proposed to vote at this

This amount, honour-

able senators will notice, is $526,007,622.

It

will also be observed that six times the sum
asked is somewhat less than the total amount
of the supply required.

The explanation is

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

that certain expenditures which are statutory
are not covered by specific votes.

Hon. Mr. Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
presented the report of the committee on
BIl 377.

In addition to the one-sixth of the total,
certain additional amounts have been requested at this time, because expenditures
are heaviest during this period of the year.

SENATE
These are varying percentages of the total
amount provided for each of the items in
the main estimates.
Section 3 provides for a grant of $216,900,
the amount necessary to defray the proportionate expenses incurred in respect of the
Canadian International Trade Fair, which
will be held early in June. This of course
is only one-quarter of the total sum required
in respect of this item as set forth in the
main estimates and in Schedule A of the
bill.
Section 4 provides for the grant of an
additional sum of $417,594.33, being one-sixth
of the total of the four items set out in
Schedule B. This would provide for advance
payments in respect of the Senate and the
House of Commons, which have additional
requirements at this time because during the
session of parliament heavier expenses are
incurred in the earlier part of the year.
The grant would also provide for a special
amount payable to the Unemployment Insurance Commission to cover the transfer of
labour to and from places where employment
is available, and expenses incidental thereto,
in accordance with regulations of the Governor in Council. This item must initially
finance the cost of certain improvements
which, under agreement with labour seeking
companies, are later recovered. The seasonal
character of labour movements contributes to
this higher-than-average expenditure, which
must be incurred in the early months of the
year. I am mentioning these points so that
honourable members will know that in every
instance it is not one-sixth of the amount
that is asked for at this time. As I said
earlier, there are certain cases where proportionately larger expenses are incurred at this
time of the year.
Section 5 of the bill would grant
$4,303,708.08, being an additional one-twelfth
of these special items set forth in Schedule C
of the bill. Honourable senators will observe
from Schedule C that these items relate to
expenditures of four departments: Agriculture, Citizenship and Immigration, Defence
Production, and Trade and Commerce.
In the case of the Department of Agriculture, the grant covers two items: first, an
amount for experimental farms, which incur
heavy expenses in connection with spring
cropping operations; and, secondly, an amount
for freight assistance on western feed grains,
as the payments are heaviest during the
winter and spring months when most of the
movement of feed grains occur.

Yesterday afternoon the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) asked me a
question in connection with this payment.
He said:
I should like to know how much money parliament has voted prior to this year to pay the freight
rates on feed grain shipped from the west to the
east.

I have the answer going back to the year
1941. It is as follows:

The reason for the grant to the Department
of Citizenship and Immigration is that the
delay between the time when purchase of
supplies abroad is authorized here in Canada
and the time when formal authority for the
expenditure reaches distant overseas offices
makes it necessary to release funds in Canada
several weeks in advance of their actual use
abroad.
The grant to the Department of Defence
Production, vote No. 79, would provide capital
assistance for the construction, acquisition,
extension or improvement of capital equipment or works by private contractors engaged
in defence contracts, or by crown plants
operated on a management-fee basis, or by
crown companies under direction of the
Minister of Defence Production, subject to
approval of the Treasury Board. Since reaching its peak of operation in 1952, the capital
assistance program has been gradually tapering off, and the greater proportion of the
year's supply is needed in the early months
of the year. In this connection it is interesting to note that the commitments made in
1953-54, and to be carried over to 1954-55,
will amount to approximately $12 million of
the $25 million program for the current year.
May I at this time refer to the second
question asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). It had to do with
vote No. 79, and was as follows:
I would like to know if the amount of $25 million
has ever appeared before.

The answer is that it has not appeared
before in an interim supply bill, for it was
not necessary to have an advance for the flrst

MARCH 31, 1954
two months.
However, conditions have
changed now and it is expected that as we
get near the end of this program the big payments will be made at the beginning of the
fiscal year commencing tomorrow, rather
than later on.
The grant to the Department of Trade and
Commerce would provide additional funds
for electricity and gas inspection services, and
weights and measures inspection services,
additional appropriations being required at
this time owing to the fact that these services
carry on the major part of their work in the
spring and summer months when inspectors
are able to get around freely.
Honourable senators, at the outset of my
remarks I said that the purpose of this bill
was to finance the public service for approximately the first two months of the new fiscal
year which will start tomorrow; but there
are instances where larger amounts have
been requested because of prevailing conditions in connection with certain expenditures. No part of this bill votes the total
amount of the main estimates. Of course, I
give the usual undertaking that passage of
this bill will in no way prejudice the right
of any honourable senator to discuss or
criticize the items when the estimates come
before a committee of this house or before
the house itself.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend, at this stage certainly, to
make a budget speech, because I would not
be permitted to do so anyway, but I wish
to register an old objection, for the ninth
time. It seems to me that parliament could
work out a plan whereby the estimates
would come to this house early enough to
be given proper consideration. It is true
that this bill shows certain items of the
estimates, but these constitute a very small
part of the whole outlay, so it is impossible
at this time to say much about it.
For the benefit of the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), I asked
for information on the item of $17 million,
appearing in Schedule C of Bill 391, for
freight assistance on western feed grains
carried to eastern Canada. The reason I
did so was that several times, especially
when my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) was speaking, the
honourable gentleman wanted to know about
the $65 million that parliament voted for
the farmers of western Canada because a few
years earlier the government had made a
deal with the United Kingdom under which
those farmers lost $600 million or-valuing
the wheat at the American price-a billion
dollars.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I said nothing about the
$65 million. I could say something about it,
though.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You could make a very
poor speech, as far as the $65 million is
concerned. That sum of $65 million seems
to be a choice morsel in the mouth of my
honourable friend. He accuses the farmers
of western Canada of having received $65
million from the taxpayers of Canada,
whereas the fact is that for years and years
the taxpayers of western Canada made a
contribution that benefited his part of the
country and every other part of the two
central provinces. Western taxpayers were
paying the shot for years and yearsHon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend
to ask him when I made reference to the
$65 million?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes: in the house when my
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
was speaking.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I said not one word about
$65 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought you mentioned
$65 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I rise to contradict my
friend; I said nothing about it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then my hearing must be
very poor. However, I will take your word
for it.
Under this freight assistance a sum of $207
million has been paid, and the people of
Ontario and Quebec-largely Ontario-have
benfited by obtaining feed grains at prices
less than they otherwise would have had to
pay. Those are the facts. So I do not want
to hear any more about the farmers of
western Canada getting something they did
not deserve.
The item of $25 million for defence production, also in Schedule C, is clear to me
now that it has been explained. At first, I
could not understand why that amount was
voted at this time of the year. To my knowledge it is the first time it has been voted,
but I can understand the purpose of it and
I am satisfied with the explanation.
I am willing to vote for this temporary
supply bill, but I hope that the new leader
of the house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) will make
it a special point to confer with the Minister
of Finance to work out some scheme whereby
the estimates will come to this house sooner
than they have in the past.
I want to pay a compliment to the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). In past years a committee of this.

nonsense! Anyone knows that the proper
place to feed cattle is where the feed is
grown".
I am not singling out my friend from Mount
Stewart for any special criticism, but I should
like to point out that a good deal of the feed
coming to Ontario by subsidized freight
simply follows the cattle down here. The
cattle are shipped while their weight is relatively light, and freight assistance on the feed
that follows them accrues to the advantage of
the eastern farmer.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The western farmer?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, not the western
farmer. I am pointing out that all the advantage goes to the Ontario farmer who gets the
cattle when their weight is light, feeds them
on grain on which the government bas paid
part of the freight, and sells them in the
densely populated areas where the market
price is high. I say the eastern farmer has
all the advantage accruing from the government-paid freight.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: He gets all the gravy.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The subsidy is really
going to the eastern farmer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not propose to
enter into the controversy on feed grain, but
if I may make an impartial comment, I would
say it seems to me that the government assistance on freight means profit to all concerned.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not complaining.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
asked me a question about vote No. 431, in
Schedule A of the bill. In reply, I must admit
that I do not know under what system of
bookkeeping that item was set up. I have
looked at the main estimates, and I note that
the estimate for the Canadian International
Trade Fair for the full year 1954-55 is
$867,600.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And we are now asking
for one-sixth of that?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The question asked
by the honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) comes under the
supplementary estimates, and I shall answer
it when that bill is before us.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to. and the bill was

THIRD READJNG

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 392, an Act for granting to
Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1954.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
which has been in the hands of the members
of this bouse since yesterday, includes the
final supplementary estimates for the present
year. The Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) a few minutes ago suggested that I
should try to get the estimates for the next
fiscal year before the Senate as soon as
possible. Of course, copies of the estimates
have been distributed to honourable senators,
but the supplementary estimates, which we
are now considering, came to us only yesterday. I think some progress has been made
along the lines of my honourable friend's
suggestion, because I am told that in the past
the bill frequently reached this house only a
very short time before it was proposed to be
passed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree with that statement.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I hope I shall be able
to keep up the good work.
This bill refers to most of the departments
of government. As the bill did reach us

been able to digest it all myself, but I shall
try to answer any questions that honourable
senators may ask.
Again I say that I realize it is not customary to consider a bill clause by clause or item
by item unless the house is in committee, but
I do not see any other way of handling this
bill than by that method. Probably I could
open the discussion by answering the questions that were asked of me yesterday by the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
My honourable friend asked this question
regarding vote No. 565:
What amount was voted for this purpose, payments to municipalities, last year and the previous
year, and is this the total amount which will be
asked for this year?

The answer is as follows: In the fiscal
year 1951-52, $1,845,000 was provided in
the main estimates to cover this grant, and
in the supplementary estimates for that year
$249,000 was provided, making a total in that
year of $2,094,000. In 1952-53, the amount
in the main estimates was $2,360,800, and
in the supplementary estimates provision was
made for grants totalling in all $253,856,
making a total in that year of $2,614,656.
In 1953-54 the amount provided for in the
main estimates was $2,701,300, and in the
supplementary estimates there is a further
grant of $343,783, making a total of $3,045,083
in the present fiscal year. The amount asked
for in the bill is this supplementary grant of
$343,783.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
also asked me the following question:
With respect to vote No. 568, I should like to
know whether $38 million is the totrl amount to be
expended for that purpose, this year, or will further
moneys be voted?
As honourable senators know, in 1950 the

superannuation account had a liability of
approximately $350 million, which the government has since reduced by contribution
until today it is approximately of the nature
of some $200 million. However, with the
recent increase in salaries it has been found
necessary to make a further contribution to
the account, not for the purpose of writing
down the outstanding old liability but to
maintain the position as it was prior to the
recent salary increases and the inclusion
under the superannuation account on January
1, 1954, of some sixty thousand temporary
employees not previously covered by the act.
In other words, this $38 million is an amount
required in order that the superannuation account may not show an increased deficit; it
is being paid in so that the account will be
in the same position at the end of this year
as it was at the beginning of the year.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable Leader
of the Government allow me to interrupt
him? I understand also that this year the
government is paying interest on that overdraft into the fund, and maybe that was
done last year too. Can my honourable friend
say whether the overdraft has been increased?
I understand that no increase has been made.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not conversant
with the method, but I understand that
probably, as the Leader of the Opposition
states, the result is that the overdraft will
remain at $200 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct. That is all right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader of the
Opposition also asked me a question in regard to votes 612 and 613, the first two items
on page 10 of the Schedule.
I might say right here that he has given

me quite a bit of work to do, but I was very
glad to do it; it has been an education to me

to look into this matter.
My honourable friend's question was in
these words:
I should like to refer next to the first two items
on page 10 of the schedule of this bill, and to ask
for an explanation as to why the losses were so
high as to require votes of approximately $650,000
and $200,000 to meet the deficits. I should also like
to know whether these amounts include all the
estimated loss under this item for the fiscal year
1954.
I can say that this amount is to include all
the estimated losses for the fiscal year. I
could give the reasons as to how this loss
came about. It had been expected that there
would be a profit during the present fiscal
year, which is ending today, but in fact there
was carried over from the previous fiscal
year a deficit which it had been expected

would have been looked after by profits from
the present fiscal year, but instead of being
a profit there was a loss. Freight revenue

decreased by $1,465,562, or 25.3 per cent.
This reduction was mainly due to a decline in
the tonnage of raw sugar carried northbound
and a reduction of about 25 per cent in the
freight rates. Export tonnage decreased by

13,999 tons, or approximately 11-5 per cent,
and import tonnage declined by 67,807 tons,
or 29-4 per cent.
Passenger and miscellaneous revenue was reduced by $765,117, or
82-6 per cent, in consequence of the withdrawal of the Lady ships from the service
late in 1952. The revenue from charter hire

on a time basis declined $620,593, or 97-9
per cent, owing to the depressed time charter

market. Subsidy payments from the colonies
declined $88,663, through discontinuance of
payments consequent upon the withdrawal
of the two Lady vessels from the service.

Hon. Mr. Reid: There are three questions
which I should like to put to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald). Before I do so I wish to make
one comment on the item of $38,000,000, the
government contribution to the superannua-

tion account. Since I learned last session
that over the past ten years the sums collected from civil servants as contributions
to superannuation equal the amount which
has been paid out, I have awaited an
explanation as to why this fund has been
built up to around $350 million. I could
understand the necessity for doing so if an

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If I may interrupt

he would ask his questions one at a time, and
I will try to answer them one by one.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then I will refer first to the

Hon. Mr. Reid: British Columbia has many
attractions well worth seeing. I should like
to know whether the provincial government
is making a contribution to the British Empire
Games comparable to that being made by the
dominion government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have a long explanation here but I do not think it is necessary to
read it. I think the point referred to by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) can be covered by this
statement:
The Games Association report that they need
about $55,000 in ail, primarily to meet the travelling expenses of 225 athletes to and from Vancouver but also to pay training and equipping
expenses. Because Canada is host at this year's
games the committee is making a special effort to
have Canadian entries in every event. The association's campaign for $55,000 is divided as follows:
Private firms and individuals ........ $30,000
12,500
Provincial governments ..............
12,500
Dominion government ...............
$55,000

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask what the British
Columbia provincial grant amounts to?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information
as to grants by individual provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to know what
British Columbia is contributing. I am wondering whether it is overlooking the British
Empire Games.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not got before
me the budget for any provincial government.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not opposed to item
565, payments to municipalities, but I am
wondering whether it is a new departure to
recognize Admiralty properties.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have a long list of
all the municipalities, and I shall be glad to
go over it with the honourable gentleman
from New Westminster.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That will be satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The Municipal Grants
Bill for 1954-55, which I understand will be
brought down before parliament within a
few days, will establish a new formula for
making municipal grants. I think it would
be worth while to ascertain at that time just
how the formula is arrived at, what properties are involved, and so on.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to delay the house. I should
like to thank the officials of the Department
of Finance for sending me an advance copy
of this bill about two weeks ago, for this
gave me some time to work on the questions that I asked the Leader of the Government yesterday. I must confess that I did
not just think those questions up on the spur
of the moment.
I should like to make one or two references
to this legislation. Payments to municipalities involves one of the most important questions in Canada today. I am not criticizing
the government for what it proposes here,
but I do not believe it fully appreciates the
difficult financial problems confronting our
municipalities, especially in the administration of our schools. In my young days schools
were not costly to run, but they certainly
are now. I taught school for three years at a
salary of $35 a month, and I am sure some
of you have had a similar experience.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What about room and
board?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that I only paid
$10 a month for room and board and washing.
Hon. Mr. Grant: You must have been the
principal.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was the whole teaching
staff. I do not think Canadians have ever
fully realized what a great service our school
teachers perform. Nothing can compare to the
contribution they make to the public life of
Canada. This fact is now beginning to be
recognized, and young men and women
embarking on this career are now receiving
payment that is more commensurate with
their services. There is no doubt that the
mother in the home has more influence than
anybody else on the life of a child, but next

MARCH 31, 1954
to the mother comes the school teacher. The
boys and girls to whom I taught the ABC's
pay me a lot more respect these days than do
a lot of other people around my home city of
Winnipeg. When I was attending public
school the children were pretty boisterous.
Discipline was not too good until a new
teacher, Mr. Lang, came to the school. I well
recall his first day in the classroom. He
picked up the ringleader by the scruff of the
neck, and, after a good shaking, he told
him "You're not going to be a troublemaker
around here any longer; I'm the head of this
school." Well, there was no more trouble in
that school for the rest of the year.
Municipalities have to bear the cost of
The basic

salary for a teacher in Winnipeg is $2,000,
which is not one bit too much. Secretaries
in private offices are paid more than that.
The teacher's maximum pay runs to approximately $5,000, but many other professions
which pay a great deal more than that do
not make nearly as valuable a contribution to
the welfare of the country. I laud the governrment for having authorized a grant of
some $7 million to assist Canadian universities a couple of years ago, for I have no
doubt that this action kept some of them in
existence. If our school system is to be
properly maintained a larger amount of
money will have to be paid to municipalities
in lieu of taxes on federal properties. That
is my argument. Only a percentage of what
should be paid is paid now. If the govern-

ment has $100,000 worth of property in the
city of Brandon, why should the municipality
not collect taxes based on the full value of
that property, as it does in the case of other
property? There is a tremendous amount of
federal property in Ottawa, and as a result
that city receives a larger proportionate payment in lieu of taxes than it otherwise would.
Unless we do something to increase the
payments to municipalities we are going to
have a breakdown in our educational system,
for the municipalities will be utterly unable
to carry their taxation load. I am glad to
see the payment that is provided for in this
bill, but it does not go far enough. When the
Municipal Grants Bill comes before the
Senate I am going to advocate that the
dominion government pay taxes on federal
property to the same extent as do ordinary
property owners. Full taxes should be paid,
for example, on the parliament buildings in
Ottawa. This sort of thing has got to be
done if we are going to maintain municipal
life in this country.
I had intended to talk about a few other
items, such as the operating loss on the New

Zealand meat deal, but I do not think my
comments would add anything to the life
of the nation.
I wish to thank the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the information
he has given; I think he has answered my
questions very fairly.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I could not have asked
those questions if the Department of Finance
had not sent me the information I needed,
and I appreciate it very much.
Honourable senators, I urge that between
now and next session we members of this
house study the question of possible municipal taxation of federal government properties,
with a view to assisting the municipalities to
finance public school education in this
country.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
we have been told that $46 million has been
spent under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation
Act since its inception. I wish to say that I
think that money has been very well spent.
Before the police arrived in 1874, great herds
of buffalo roamed over the prairies; there
were thousands of them, stretching as far as
the eye could see. They all disappeared, and
when the police established law and order
great herds of cattle took the place of the
buffalo on the prairie, and there were good
times and good ranches. Later, the dominion
government decided to break up the open
leases and throw open the land for homesteads, and thousands of people from the
United States and some from eastern Canada
settled on those homesteads. Then disaster
followed and relief had to be given. Of the
$13 million handed out in relief, only two
or three million dollars were ever recovered.
Under the Prairie Farm Assistance Act help
was given to people in areas where the crop
had failed year after year.
In about 1935 the department decided that
a better policy could be worked out and that
people in the burned-out and dried-out areas
should be rehabilitated. Many thousands of
stock watering reservoirs and many thousands
of small irrigation dams and some larger
irrigation schemes were established. The result
is that about a million and a half acres that
had been dry and almost useless have been
put under water, and instead of only being
able to grow wheat farmers have been able
to grow root crops and feed crops and cattle
can be fed right at the sugar factories. The
industry of that whole country has thus
become diversified. As I have said, a million
and a half acres have been put under water,
but as much more could still be irrigated.

SENATE
Because of the irrigation that has already
been done, beet sugar factories, canneries
and processing plants have been established,
and cities and towns have grown and prospered. Many crops are grown in the fields
where formerly they could not have been
grown at all. This has been a great blessing
to the people who have lived so long on the
prairies, and it has also contributed to the
economy of the whole country. That is why
I say that I think the money has been very
well spent.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

THE LATE SENATOR JONES
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before we proceed with the business of
the day may I be permitted to pay tribute to
our late colleague Senator J. Walter Jones,
of Prince Edward Island. Yesterday we were
all deeply shocked by his sudden death.
Indeed, his unexpected passing is a disturbing reminder of the uncertainty of life and
the slender thread which binds us to earth.
The late Walter Jones was born at Pownall,
Prince Edward Island, in 1878, a son of the
late James Benjamin Jones and Maria Isabelle Stewart.
His early education was
received at Prince of Wales College, Charlottetown, following which he attended
Acadia University, where he received his
Bachelor of Arts degree; and later at the
University of Toronto, where he received his
Master's degree. Post-graduate work was
carried on at Chicago, Cornell, Columbia and
Clark Universities.
During the .course of this rather full and
interesting career he taught school in Virginia, U.S.A., and was employed by the
Department of Agriculture in Washington,
D.C., after which he moved to Ottawa, where
he became associated with the Commission
on Conservation and wrote a book entitled
Fur Farming in Canada. In 1914 he returned
to his native province, where he became one
of Prince Edward Island's leading farmers.
In later years he had become a cattle breeder,
and had attained not only national but international distinction.
His political career was no less colourful.
In 1921 he was a member of, and indeed, a
candidate for, the Farmers' Progressive Party.
Subsequently, he joined the Liberal Party, and
in 1935 he entered the Prince Edward Island
Legislature. In 1943 he became Premier of
that province, and he headed the government
there from that time until May of 1953, when
he was summoned to the Senate of Canada.
While the late senator had come to this
chamber only recently, he was widely known
throughout Canada because of his place in
public life generally and in his native province. As Premier of Prince Edward Island
83280-27

he had become a familiar figure, not only in
that province but also at Ottawa, where he
had attended various interprovincial conferences, at which the claims of the smallest
province were as vigorously and ably presented as those of the largest.
It is a matter of deep regret that he was
not spared to be with us longer, to bring
to this chamber his wise counsel, not only in
agricultural matters, on which he was an
authority, but in maritime affairs generally.
In his death the country at large has lost
an outstanding citizen, and his native province a loyal and devoted son.
I am sure all honourable senators would
wish to join with me in extending deepest
sympathy to Mrs. Jones and the other members of his family.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
it was not my privilege to meet Senator
Jones until after he was appointed to this
chamber: because of my absence during the
fall sittings of this session, my acquaintance
with him started only in January of this year.
I enjoyed my acquaintanceship with Senator Jones very much, as did every other
member of this louse. He struck me as a man
who would in the future make an outstanding contribution to our work here, for he
possessed a spirit of independence and would
make his decisions for the general good of
Canada, irrespective of who might be
affected.
An incident which occurred in the cafeteria
of the hotel where both Senator Jones and
I lived revealed to me his deep interest in
cattle-raising in the Maritimes. While in
search of a table on a busy day in the cafeteria I was invited to share one with a man
who I later learned had emigrated from,
I think, Armenia, and was then a prosperous
cattle raiser in Nova Scotia. Within a few
moments Senator Jones entered the cafeteria
and I invited him to sit at our table. Almost
immediately my companion and the senator
entered into a discussion about the cattle
business. I appealed to them to talk about
wheat for a change, so that I could get in
on the conversation, but obviously they were
both experts in the cattle-raising field, and
I was unable to make any contribution. The
senator remarked to me later, "I should be
home now, because I am quite sure that one
of my cows will today set a new record for
milk production in Canada." It was very
remarkable how quickly he had struck up
a friendship with a European immigrant who
had become a citizen of one of the Maritime
provinces, and how genuine was the interest
between them in a field vital to Canada's
economy. I felt from that moment that

SENATE
Senator Jones had had experience which
qualified him to give great service to the
Senate and to the people of Canada.
I agree with all that has been said by the
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and I want
to join with him in expressing on behalf of
all honourable senators our kindliest thoughts
to the wife and children of our deceased
colleague. On occasions of this kind there
is only one source of solace, and I know
they will find solace there.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable senators, in the death of the late Senator J.
Walter Jones, Prince Edward Island has lost
a noteworthy citizen. In his early life in
that province he followed the profession of
school teaching. He was principal of the
Macdonald Consolidated School, a mile or so
from his own home. This school was built
by Sir William Macdonald, a native of Prince
Edward Island, who also built Macdonald
College at Ste. Anne de Bellevue in Quebec.
After teaching a few years in Prince
Edward Island the late senator travelled to
the United States and, as our leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has already said, he taught
in Virginia, and for a time he was associated
with the Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. Later he came back to Canada,
and in 1913 he was engaged by the Commission of Conservation at Ottawa. In 1914
he returned to his native province and took
up the profession of farming. He specialized
in the breeding of Holstein cattle and, I think
it is correct to say, he became the leading
breeder of Holstein cattle in Eastern Canada.
His stock took many prizes at the Canadian
National Exhibition in Toronto, at the fair at
Amherst, and at other places where he
exhibited stock regularly each year.
After making a success of farming, he
turned to the political field. As the leader
has said, he campaigned in the federal
election of 1921 as a candidate of the Farmers'
Progressive party, but was not successful.
Later he joined the Liberal party, and in
1935 he was elected to the legislature. He was
re-elected in 1939, 1943, 1947 and 1950, and
I may say that for eight years I was a colleague of his in the provincial house. He
became Premier of Prince Edward Island in
May, 1943, and held that position until May,
1953, when he was summoned to this
chamber.
All politicians make mistakes, and it may
be supposed that the late senator made a
few; nevertheless, his many outstanding
achievements will remain as a monument to
his memory.
We mourn today the loss of an outstanding
man and a good Canadian. I feel sure that

I am expressing the sentiment of this honourable chamber when I convey sincere
sympathy to his bereaved wife and family.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I should like to add a word to what has been
said in memory of an old friend, who, as the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has said, though well known
throughout Canada, was best known in the
Maritime provinces, where he was esteemed
for his services, his qualities and his characacter. Last Tuesday evening, when I glanced
across the chamber, I noticed that he looked
tired, so I moved next to him and we talked
together. I asked him what he had done over
the week-end, and he said he had remained
indoors and read all the time. Next day the
report came that he had died. I went to his
room with some friends, and the doctor said
that he had gone. Thus ended his journey
here below. It was a long and fruitful journey, filled with service and achievement. I
am sure that, had he lived longer, his services
here would have done honour to the Senate
and enhanced his reputation as a public man.
He gained distinction in the industrial field;
he was a leader in agriculture; and from
what he told me on several occasions I realized that he had achieved much success in
various spheres of farm production. He was
invariably sustained by the public of the
Island he served; they believed in him and
they always re-elected him until he was
translated here. I knew him to be a man of
strong convictions. He could be resolute in
He had distinguished educational
action.
attainments, yet be was an ordinary man,
for-like a great many people in Prince
Edward Island-he believed in plain living
and high thinking.
Today the flag atop the Peace Tower flies
at half-mast, Parliament's dignified salute and
tribute to the memory of one of Canada's
outstanding sons, and his remains are speeding towards his Island home where he will
be laid to rest among the scenes he loved so
well.
At this time our sympathy goes to the
widow and family of our deceased colleague.
I feel they will be sustained by their abiding
faith, and that in the shadow of this affliction
they will find comfort in the knowledge that
he served well his day and generation.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senator, one feels some diffidence about
obtruding on the family affairs of a province,
but in this particular case I rise to pay my
respects to our late colleague because his
reputation extended far beyond the boundaries of his native Prince Edward Island, and
because I had the privilege of knowing him
fairly intimately for alnost fifty years.

APRIL 1, 1954
I first saw and met J. Walter Jones on the
occasion of the Intercollegiate Sports Fieldday at Toronto somne fifty years ago. At
that Urne he was a student at the Ontario
Agricultural College at Guelph, and he had
corne to Toronto as a member of the O.A.C.
team to compete in what were then known as
the Varsity Games, an annual event participated in by ail the institutions gathered
together under the name of the University of
Toronto. He distinguished himself that day
by hurling the sixteen-pound hammer farther
than it had ever been thrown before in that
competition, establishing a record which
remained irnbroken for many years.
As well as being athletically inclined he
soon revealed evidence of a distinctive
interest in scîentific agriculture. After his
graduation from the University of Toronto
with the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Agriculture, he pursued post-graduate studies
in the United States, as has been outlined by
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and by his colleague from Mount
Stewart (Hon. Mr. Mclntyre). In the course
of those years he narrowly missed becoming
a specîalized scientific officiai in the field
of agricultural science. He concentrated
particularly on that branch of scientific
agriculture known as animal husbandry. The
Conservation Commission of Canada had then
been in existence for several years. I think
the Commission's work reflected something
of a similar effort which had been sponsored
in the United States by President Theodore
Roosevelt. The idea that the natural resources
on this continent should be conserved and
not completely destroyed by industry and
financial progress had a great deal of vogue
in those days. In any event, the Conservation
Commission of Canada was set up, under the
chairmanship of that very able man, the late
Sir Clifford Sifton, and to his attention came
the name of Mr. Walter Jones, a student of
scientific agriculture, who was also particularly interested in the development of
fur farming on a domesticated basis. Walter
Jones returned to Canada and became
associated with the commission, devoting
himself to research for a year or two, and
travelling widely. This experience enabled
him to write the book entitled Fur Farming
in Canada, which became, and still is, the
authoritative text-book on the subi ect in this
country and in other countries as weil.
After he completed his work with the
Conservation Commission he returned to
Prince Edward Island to resume farming.
Through a journalistic assigrmnent that was
given to me to go down there and write up
the black fox industry, which at that time
was a very hectic development in the life
of the Island, I had the pleasure of meeting
83280-271

him, again shortly after he went back from
Ottawa. I stayed with him at his home at
Bunbury Farm and received a great deal of
help from him. He was not one of the earliest
pioneers in the black fox industry, but he
did a great deal towards extending the
interest in domesticating wild fur-bearing
animais to other parts of the country. He was
also directly instrumental in the moving of
reindeer into the far northern regions of this
country and in helping to domesticate them.
I was intimately associated with him, in the
years following, and I have often thought
that, had he devoted ail his time to that
specialized field of scientific research, he
might have become an even more valuable
public servant than he afterwards did. However, it was inevitable that sooner or later
he should take an active part in the public
life of his province. He had a genuine urge
to render public service, and proved to be
a very able and wise administrator and
organizer of human effort in Prince Edward
Island and elsewhere. At bottom, he had the
instincts of a pretty shrewd trader as well. As
I said to one of my friends today, who knew
hlm, he reminded me in many respects of
that famous old literary character David
Harum, whose watchword was, "Do unto
others as you would have done to you-but do
it fust." Years later, I learned that there was
some truth in those words as applîed to him.
My honourable friend from Mount Stewart
(Hon. Mr. Mclntyre), who was for some years
the late senator's colleague i the Prince
Edward Island legislature, has spoken of his
service as a member of the legîsiature and
as Premier. I think it is worth recording here
that in 1935, after the federal election,
Senator Jones played a leading part in providing a seat in Queen's County for the
Minister of Finance, the Honourable Charles
Dunning.
The late senator was summoned to the
Senate less than a year ago, and was sworn
in at the opening of the present session.
Since he came here 1 felt that he was a lonely
man. Whether or not he was lonely because
of his physical condition, which finally told
its story, I do not know: I surmise that he
was quite conscious of his decline, but was
too proud and too independent in mind to
admit it or even acknowledge it. At any rate,
he was unable to show the samne degree of
actîvity and enjoy the samne prominence
which he had known for so many years. It
is regrettable that he did not have more
opportunity to give expression to his experience, wisdom and knowledge in those fields
in which he was so competent. I think it
irked hixn a great deal that circumstances
did not afford him that opportunity. In past
years he had been of a somewhat.restlessi

SENATE
impatient and critical temperament, and I do
not think he was ready to accept his new
environment philosophically. I deeply regret,
therefore, that his end came so soon and that
he was not spared to enjoy some of the satisfactions which I am sure would have come
to him with a greater share of those responsibilities which are to be assumed by the
Senate.
I should like to express my feelings of
deepest sympathy to his wife and family,
whose warm hospitality I have had the
pleasure of enjoying on several occasions.
PRIVATE BILL
BAI-OISE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY OF
CANADA, LIMITED-REPORT OF
COMMITTEE
Hon. SalIer A. Hayden, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented the report of the committee
on Bill L-13.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the bill (L-13),
intituled: "An Act to incorporate Baloise Fire
Insurance Company of Canada, Limited", have in
obedience to the order of reference of March 30,
1954, examined the said bill and now beg leave to
report the same with the following amendments:
1. Page 1, line 12: strike out the comma.
2. Page 1, line 13: strike out the word "Limited".
3. In the title: strike out the comma and the
word "Limited".

senators, when shall this report be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,
I move that the report be concurred in now.
The motion was agreed to.

a formal motion-that the Agreement on
Commerce between Canada and Japan,
signed at Ottawa, March 31, 1954, which was
tabled yesterday, be ordered printed in
Hansard.
I am sure, honourable senators, there is a
good deal in these agreements that would be
of general interest throughout Canada, possibly of more interest in some sections than
in others. Bearing in mind the inquiry that
has been undertaken by our Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations into the
development of trade between NATO countries, I think all readers of Hansard would
like to see the text of the agreements printed
there.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I would be pleased to comply with the
request of my honourable friend. May I point
out that there is only one agreement, but
that there are certain notes or letters
appended to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They should be included
in the appendix.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They could be included. I would support a motion to that
effect.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Then, with leave, I
move:
That a copy of the Agreement on Commerce
between Canada and Japan, signed at Ottawa,
March 31, 1954, including the correspondence on
the Agreement and the Agreetd Officiai Minute, be
printed as an appendix to the Official Report of the
Debates of the Senate and form part of the permanent records of this house.

EASTER RECESS

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
leader give the house any information as to
the possible extent of the Easter recess?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is difficult to say
definitely at this time when we shall adjourn
for the Easter recess. As honourable senators know, the House of Commons intends
to adjourn on April 14 and reassemble on
April 26. It is quite possible that the Senate
will finish its work next week. The debate
on the budget may continue in the House of
Commons for at least one week after April 26.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are an optimist.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does my friend suggest that I am an optimist in thinking it will
continue that long?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should say it would last
much longer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Of course, I cannot
say when the budget debate will be
concluded.
Assuming we complete our work next
week, I do not think we would need to
reassemble until one week after the House
of Commons does. However, we shall have
more information next week, and as soon as
I have anything definite I shall present it to
the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be allowed to suggest that this house reassemble on a Tuesday
instead of a Monday. It is inconvenient for
honourable senators from Newfoundland and
Prince Edward Island, as well as those from
the West, to get here on a Monday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The remarks of the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
will not be forgotten when the matter is
decided. Of course, it is not for me to

decide when we shall adjourn. I appreciate
the confidence honourable members have
placed in me, but all I can do is present my
views to the house in the form of a motion.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are too m'odest.
NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to

Harbours Board Act.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved concurrence in
the amendments.
He said: Honourable senators, before the
motion is put I should perhaps say that the
amendments proposed by the committee do,
I think, meet completely the criticisms that
were made on this bill in the debate on

APPENDIX
AGREEMENT ON COMMERCE BETWEEN CANADA AND JAPAN
Signed at Ottawa, March 31, 1954
The Government of Canada and the Government of Japan, desiring to strengthen the
traditional bonds of friendship which unite
the two countries and to facilitate further
and to develop the commercial relations
existing between Canada and Japan, have
resolved to conclude an agreement which
will regulate the commercial relations
between Canada and Japan and have
accordingly appointed their respective representatives for this purpose, who have agreed
as follows:
Article I
1. Each Contracting Party shall accord
to the other Contracting Party unconditional
most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters with respect to customs duties and
charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation or
imposed on the international transfer of payments for imports or exports, and with
respect to the method of levying such
duties and charges, with respect to the
rules
and
formalities
connected
with
importation or exportation, and with respect
to all internal taxes or other internal
charges of any kind, and with respect to all
laws, regulations and requirements affecting
internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, distribution or use of imported goods within
the territory of such Contracting Party.
2. Accordingly, products of either Contracting Party imported into the territory of
the other Contracting Party shall not be
subject, in regard to the matters referred to
in paragraph 1 of this Article, to any duties,
taxes or charges higher, or to any rules or
formalities more burdensome, than those to
which the like products of any third country
are or may hereafter be subject.
3. Similarly, products exported from the
territory of either Contracting Party and
consigned to the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be subject, in regard
to the matters referred to in paragraph 1 of
this Article, to any duties, taxes, or charges
higher, or to any rules or formalities more
burdensome, than those to which the like

products when consigned to the territory of
any third country are or may hereafter be
subject.
4. Any advantage, favour, privilege or
immunity which has been or may hereafter
be granted by either Contracting Party in
regard to the matters referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to any product
originating in any third country or consigned
to the territory of any third country shall be
accorded immediately and without compensation to the like product originating in or
consigned to the territory of the other Contracting Party, respectively, and irrespective
of the nationality of the carrier.
5. The provisions of this Article relating
to most-favoured-nation treatment are not
applicable to exclusive advantages accorded
by Canada to members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, including their dependent territories, and to the Republic of
Ireland.
Article II
Either Contracting Party shall accord to
the products of the other Contracting Party,
which have been in transit through the territory of any third country receiving mostfavoured-nation treatment from the importing
country, treatmcnt no less favourable than
that which would have been accorded to
such products had they been transported
from their place of origin to their destination
without going through the terrritory of such
third country.
Either Contracting Party
shall, however, be free to maintain its
requirements of direct consignment existing
on the date of the present Agreement in
respect of any goods in regard to which such
direct consignment has relation to the Contracting Party's prescribed method of valuation for duty purposes.
Article III
1. No prohibitions or restrictions shall be
applied by either Contracting Party on the
importation of any product of the other
Contracting Party, or, except as provided
in legislation affecting essential security
interests, on the exportation of any product

APRIL 1, 1954
consigned to the territory of such other Contracting Party, unless the importation of the
like product of all third countries or the
exportation ef the like product to all third
countries is similarly prohibited or restricted.
2. In all matters relating to the allocation
of foreign exchange, and to the administration of foreign exchange restrictions, affecting transactions involving the importation
and exportation of goods, each Contracting
Party undertakes to accord to the other
Contracting
Party
unconditional
mostfavoured-nation treatment.
3. Both Contracting Parties recognize that
the existence of balance of payments difficulties in many countries, and the widespread
inconvertibility of currencies, do not permit
the immediate and full achievement of nondiscriminatory application of trade and
exchange restrictions
affecting imports.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions
of the present Agreement, either Contracting
Party may, in the application of trade or
exchange restrictions affecting imports for
the purpose of safeguarding its external
financial position and balance of payments,
temporarily deviate from the provisions of
paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, provided
that:
(a) Its restrictions shall be applied in such
a way as to avoid unnecessary damage to
the commercial or economic interests of the
other Contracting Party.
(b) Its restrictions shall not be applied in
such a way as to result directly or indirectly
in discrimination as between countries which
are treated as part of the United States dollar area under its exchange control regulations, or as between countries whose
currencies are or become convertible in the
hands of persons who are treated as nonresidents under the exchange control regulations of the countries concerned.
Article IV
1. Each Contracting Party undertakes that
if it establishes or maintains a state enterprise wherever located, or grants to any
enterprise, formally or in effect, exclusive or
special privileges, such enterprise shall, in its
purchases or sales involving either imports
or exports, act in a manner consistent with
the principles of non-discriminatory treatment provided for in the present Agreement.
To this end, subject to the provisions of
Article III, such enterprise shall make any
purchases or sales solely in accordance with
commercial considerations including price,
quality, availability, marketability and other
conditions of purchase or sale, and shall
afford to the enterprises of the other Contracting Party adequate opportunity in

accordance with customary business practice
to compete for participation in such purchases or sales.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this
Article shall not apply to imports of products for immediate or ultimate consumption
in governmental use and not otherwise for
resale or use in the production of goods for
sale. With respect to such imports, each
Contracting Party shall accord to the trade of
the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment.
Article V
Each Contracting Party undertakes to conform in its trade and commerce to internationally accepted fair practices, particularly in matters relating to trade marks,
marks of origin and rights under patents,
and to co-operate with the other Contracting
Party with a view to preventing any practices which might prejudicially affect the
commerce between the two countries.
Article VI
The Government of either Contracting
Party shall give sympathetic consideration to
any representations which the Government of
the other Contracting Party may make in
respect of the implementation of the present
Agreement.
Article VII
1. The present Agreement shall be ratified
by both Contracting Parties and shall enter
into force on the date of the exchange of
the instruments of ratification which shall
take place in Tokyo.
2. The present Agreement shall continue in
effect for a period of one year from its entry
into force and thereafter until three months
from the day on which either Contracting
Party shall have given notice to the other
Contracting Party of an intention of terminating the Agreement.
In witness whereof the representatives of
the two Governments, duly authorized for
the purpose, have signed the present Agreement.

OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
25, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Gershaw for the second reading of
Bill K-13, an Act to amend the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in speaking to this bill I want at the outset
to say that I approach not only the bill but
the matter of narcotic drugs with some
diffidence, realizing the many complexities of
the subject and the great problem it has
become, not only internationally, but nationally. From information and personal observation, I am of the opinion that, generally
speaking, the people of Canada have taken
little interest in this very grave problem
of an addiction which is undermining the
lives of thousands of young Canadians, and
from which, doctors tell me, there is
practically no release but death. Without
delaying too long my remarks on the bill, I
would like to place on the record some pertinent information relating, first, to the
history of the drug, and then to the international aspects of this matter; for although
nationally we are very much concerned with
the effects of this evil trade, particularly in
certain cities, we cannot overlook the fact
that it is intertwined with international
ramifications, of which I shall speak in a few
moments.
The drug traffic has been termed "murder
on the instalment plan"; and at this point
I wish to support the recommendation made
by the honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Hodges) that the death penalty
should be inflicted on the higher-ups among
the traffickers in these drugs who are undermining, for money, the souls and bodies of
many of our young people.

Almost since time immemorial the poppy
has been the symbol of sleep and death.
The Babylonians were the first to spread
knowledge of its use, first to Persia, and
then westward to Egypt. Arabic doctors used
opium freely, and until the twelfth century
it was used largely for medicinal purposes.
From India, China first obtained opium, and
the trade in the drug, fostered in the
eighteenth century by the famous, or infamous, East India company, culminated in
the so-called "Opium War" between China
and Great Britain in 1842.
Coming to our own time: in the early
thirties Japan, after invading China, used
opium and the entire poppy plant as a weapon
of war to demoralize the Chinese people.
Tientsin became a drug-ridden city in 1937.
It bas been estimated that one-eighth of the
population of Nanking was poisoned by
narcotic drugs as a result of a program
carried out by the Japanese when they
occupied that part of China. Even more
startling is the fact that the narcotic drug
trade has now been turned against Japan
by Communist China, the world's largest
shipper of opium and heroin. This trade is
providing huge sums of money for Communist China's war chest, and the drugs are
being used to demoralize the Japanese people
and United States military personnel. It
bas been estimated-this information comes
from a committee of the United Nationsthat one shipment alone was valued at 20
million U.S. dollars.
Most of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs
to North America emanates from Hong Kong.
One just wonders why Communist China has
never interfered with British control of Hong
Kong, for evidently the Chinese Reds have
been using that port for their own benefit
and for the evil purposes of the opium trade.
Opium is also shipped in great quantities from
Italy.
It bas been estimated that 26,000 pounds of
opium were smuggled into the United States
during the years 1948 to 1952. This information, which also comes from the United
Nations, bas to do only with known quantities.
It must be realized that a considerable quantity of the opium that comes into the United
States finds its way eventually into Canada,
for international boundaries present no obstacles to traffickers in narcotic drugs.
At this time I should like to give some
credit to the United Nations for having done
much to control international traffic in narcotic drugs. It was in 1909, some forty-five
years ago, at a conference held in Shanghai,
that steps were first taken to control traffic
in narcotic drugs on an international basis.
Later on, the League of Nations took steps

APRIL 7, 1954
to control this traffic, and at the Geneva
Convention of 1925 sixty-two countries signified their willingness to do everything possible to suppress the opium trade. A limiting
convention was set up in 1931, and in 1952
a commission was established under the
United Nations. I wish to commend highly the
United Nations for the work it has done in
carrying out the program started in 1909 in
an effort to control this nefarious trade.
Great progress is being made. As honourable
senators know, Canada is represented on the
commission by Mr. K. C. Hossick, Chief of
Narcotic Control, Department of National
Health and Welfare, who has been working
valiantly and exhaustively in an effort to
control the narcotic traffic.
I think I should point out that if it were
not for the use of drugs in medical therapy,
decent people everywhere would never tolerate its continued production. So that the
picture will be clear to honourable senators,
I might mention that narcotic control is
concerned with three most important drugs.
One is cocaine, which comes mostly from
Peru. Doctors state that, as a local anesthetic,
cocaine has certain dangerous characteristics.
It is largely used in Peru and other countries
where impoverished conditions prevail, because the intake of cocaine diminishes hunger
and lessens fatigue. Cocaine has been found
useful when allowed to labourers working
in the high altitudes of Peru. Another drug
is marihuana, which is made from hemp.
This drug has no medicinal value, and its
consumption is always an abuse and a vice.
Three countries actually allow its use: India,
Tunisia and Morocco. The third drug I
refer to is opium and its derivatives. Opium
is obtained from the poppy plant; its use in
medicine and surgery is well-nigh indispensable. Morphine, a derivative of opium, is
administered by doctors principally to alleviate pain. The use of this drug has given
an enormous impetus to drug trafficking on
the North American continent.
I would like to quote from the Report of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1953, at page 19:

Following the widespread publicity given to drug
addiction among teen-age groups in the United
States some concern was feit that a similar situation might exist in Canada. So far there has been
no suggestion of such a trend developing in this
country; except for one or two isolated instances
there has been no indication of teen-age persans
resorting to the use of narcotic drugs.
A joint investigation by the Vancouver City
Police and this Force resulted in a number of persons being charged under the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act for having furnished drugs to several
teen-agers. Seven accused persons, including one
woman, were convicted, the penalties imposed
ranging from five to seven years in prison and fines
up to $1,000. In addition, six of those convicted
were sentenced to be whipped. The imposition of
whippings by the courts for violation of the Drug
Act is rare and is an indication of the serious view
taken of the supplying of drugs to young people.

Before I pass on to other information which
I have, may I say that I think every commendation should be given to the R.C.M.P., whose
officers are working under great difficulties in
an endeavour to enforce the act. But in
spite of all their endeavours it would appear,
as the report indicates, that drug addiction
and trafficking is on the increase.
The honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw), who explained the bill
now before us, outlined the effects of the use
of drugs and gave instances of the prices
paid by addicts. I do not propose to touch
on that phase of drug traffic, for I believe
it was well covered by the honourable gentleman. However, I do take mild exception to
his suggestion that not many drugs are smuggled into jails for the use of inmates. I have
a news item before me-in fact, I have several

"Heroin gets in no matter how thoroughly prisoners are searched," Dr. Richmond testified at an
inquest into the death of prison inmate Mrs. Elizabeth Wood, 33, mother of three children under 14
years.

From information I have received it seems
almost impossible to prevent prisoners from
securing drugs. They can be concealed in
many ways. I have before me the story of

that the problem of drug trafficking is increased by a tightening up of the law. In
this kind of trade a tightening up of the law
bas the effect of making drugs more difficult
to procure and thus raising prices to the
users. Dope peddlers then merely raise their
prices. As is well known, any person who
starts to use drugs needs a little bigger dose
each time to satisfy him; so the more drugs
he needs, the more money he has to have to
spend for them.
Last fall, just before returning to Ottawa
to attend the present session of parliament,
I was told by the Chief of Police of Vancouver that 90 per cent of all the young
offenders who passed through his hands were
dope users. I should perhaps point out that
there are three types of persons involved in
this business: the addict, the user-addict and
the trafficker. Not all peddlers use dope, but
those who do so have to increase their sales
in order to keep up with their own personal
needs.
After looking over the act, I would suggest that the bill before us should contain
even stiffer penalties than those it sets forth.
I should like to place before honourable
senators some recommendations made by the
Standing Committee on Prevention of Narcotic Addiction, of the Community Chest and
Council of Greater Vancouver, in a brief to
the Minister of Health and Welfare. One is
to the effect that clinics should be set up
under government supervision where addicts
could be supplied with drugs at, say, 25
cents per capsule or some other nominal
price. Under such an arrangement drug
traffickers, the committee claimed, would be
eliminated. Last session when I spoke to
the Senate on this subject I was of the
opinion that that recommendation offered a
solution to the problem. However, after
looking into the situation a little more
thoroughly, I am not so sanguine about this
as I was a year ago.
The committee recommends amendments
for:
Making a clear distinction among (a) the addict
who possesses drugs only for his own use; (b) the
addict who sells small quantities either to secure
money for his own supply or to help a friend's
need; (c) the trafficker who may or may not be an
addict but whose chief motive is profit.

prosecuted, found guilty, given a jail sentence, and his car was taken away from him.
Now, I do not think we will ever cure the
evil by prosecuting addicts, sending them to
jail and perhaps making criminals out of
them. I want to say to honourable members
of the Senate as emphatically as I can that
going to jail does not always prevent a man
from obtaining drugs. When a person who
innocently or otherwise bas become an habitual user of drugs and needs them, is caught
and taken before a court of justice, I believe
we are not going to solve his problem at
all by fining him or sending him to jail 'or
taking his car away from him.
The committee's recommended amendments continue:
The addict should be treated as a medical problem. The condition under which he is entitled to
possession of drugs should be clearly defined and
any possession apart from that permitted by the
act should constitute an offence.
Comparatively light penalties, with room for
judicial discretion for addicts who are traffickers in
a minor way only.
Drastically increased penalties for those who are
traffickers only or chiefly.

These proposed changes, which are not in
the bill before us, are I think well worthy
of Dur consideration.
May I quote further from the committee's
brief:
Sections 6 and 16 of the act, in relation to the
burden placed upon physicians, should be clarified
so that the right of a physician to treat an addict
for his addiction shall not be in doubt.
Section 6 of this act provides that it is unlawful
for a physician, veterinary surgeon or a dentist to
prescribe, administer, give, sell, or furnish drugs
as defined in the act except for medicinal purposes.
The words "physician", "veterinary surgeon", "dentiit" are separately defined in section 2 of the act.
Section 16 subsection (2), states "It is no defence
to a physician charged with an offence under section 6 that he did give, sell, furnish or prescribe
any drug to an habitual user for self-administration, unless such habitual user was suffering from
a diseased condition caused otherwise than by
excessive use of any drug".
It will be noted that this restriction in the physician's defence does not apply to dentists and veterinary surgeons. "Habitual user" is not defined in the
act, and until there is such a definition a physician
would have to take the risk of deciding whether
his patient was an "habitual user". The term "for
medicinal purposes" is not adequately defined. The
right of a physician to administer narcotics to an
addict during the course of treatment of his addiction by a gradual withdrawal program is still disputed by legal authorities.

This organization believes, and I thoroughly

that an official from the department comes
around and checks every druggist's records
very carefully with the object of seeing that
he had a prescription from a doctor for every
dispensation of drugs. Certain druggists have
pointed out to me that a doctor, when giving
drugs to an addict, does not have to write
out any prescription if the doctor himself
administers or gives the drug.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Doctors' prescriptions
are all counted, and if in any instance they
are numerous the matter is taken up with the
doctor.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The remark of the honourable senator from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr.
Howden) prompts me to say now something
which I was going to say at the end of my
speech. The problem or evil of narcotic
drug addiction in certain cities of Canada is
so serious as to warrant the giving of much
time and thought to an investigation of this
matter by the Senate, and that cannot very
well be done when we are discussing a bill
of this kind, which will simply go to committee where some official will come along
and give certain information, after which the
bill will be brought back here and passed.
That may be all very well when we are
dealing with certain types of bills; but in a
matter as serious as this one is, and which
is becoming more serious, I would suggest
that the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) carry a message to the
government suggesting that some time before
long a special committee should be set up at
which witnesses from all over Canada can
be heard on this matter. This evil is not going
to become less; in my opinion it is going to
increase.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I hesitate to interrupt the honourable senator, but I want to
assure him immediately that I will be very
glad to take his message to the government.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I presume this bill will go
to committee?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, I presume this
bill will go to committee. If it is the wish
of the house, of course, it will go.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If further consideration
were to be postponed until we could obtain
evidence from certain cities on this evil, I
would be in accord with that; but my understanding is that the committee would like
to have the bill for consideration tomorrow
morning, so that it may be returned to the
Senate in the afternoon and sent over to the
House of Commons.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If that procedure Is
followed it will not interfere with my honourable friend's suggestion. We could still go
on with the special committee which he proposes, if that is acceptable.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would very much like to
see that done.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That would be the best way
to do it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I believe that the seriousness of this whole question calls for the setting up of a committee of that kind.
Now I come to the need for treating the
addict as a patient, as one who should
receive our sympathy rather than a jail
sentence. I will quote another authority. He
is Mr. R. S. S. Wilson, a former superintendent of the R.C.M.P., with which he was
connected for many years. In the Vancouver
Province, of August 18, 1952, he says:
It is the opinion of the writer that the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act should be amended to provide
that a drug addict, after certification as such by
three physicians, must be committed for a period
of not less than ten years to a narcotic hospital
operated by the federal government.
If we are prepared to accept the proposition that
there is a close similarity between insanity and
narcotic addiction, then we should be willing to
take the next step and provide the necessary
legislation for the enforced committal and control
of the drug addict.
Now, just one word regarding our jails. It
is all very well to read that someone has been
sentenced to six months at hard labour. I
ask how many honourable senators have
taken the time to go and visit voluntarilyI say voluntarily-the jails and penetentiaries
of this country. I have taken the time to do
so; and I have come to the conclusion that
today many of our jails are regarded as
splendid "rest homes" by not a few criminals,
and that they have a fine time there. I hope
that when the Criminal Code comes before
us the term "hard labour" will have been
deleted, because hard labour is a thing of the
past; the expression means nothing at all.
There is now a psychiatric service in prisons,
and it would be enlightening to some honourable senators and others to hear the opinions
with regard to psychiatrists expressed by some
of these hardened criminals. The fact is that
offenders of this type will not hesitate to
commit some crime so that they may return
to an institution in which they are well fed
and carefully looked after, and are even able
to get drugs. This is an aspect of the matter
which, I think, should be looked into.
The situation, in short, is such as to require
action on all levels of government-municipal,
provincial and federal-as well as International co-operation. Only by concerted

SENATE
effort of this kind can we hope to stamp out
drug addiction and the vicious traffic which
flourishes on it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If it is the wish of the
house, I will move that the bill be sent to a
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suggest that it go to committee, and if I may be permitted, although I
should have mentioned this before, I will
give my reason. We have listened to three
very fine speeches, one by the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), who moved the second reading; one
by the honourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges); and, today, one by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid). I hope that this bill will be sent to
committee, and that it will not be used as the
vehicle of an investigation of the narcotic
drug business. My suggestion is that, either
during this session or at the beginning of the
next, a resolution be placed on the order

paper to deal with this subject, and that a
committee be appointed to summon the necessary witnesses and make a proper investigation. To the new members of this house I say
that my memory goes back to a time when
there was considerable controversy about
procedure under the income tax law. In this
bouse, by special resolution, a committee was
formed to investigate the Income Tax Act,
and as a result of their labours the law was
subsequently amended by parliament and
made much more workable. I am in sympathy
with the views expressed by the honourable
member from New Westminster and the honourable member from Victoria. I entirely
agree that this is a subject we are well qualiflied to investigate, and by so doing we would
render a real service to Canada. But I would
not want to tie up the matter of an investigation with the passing of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree with the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that we have had three excellent
speeches in connection with this bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Public Health and Welfare.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

TELEVISION STATIONS AND PROGRAMS
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators
will recall that a short time ago the honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) asked me certain questions regarding television stations and programs. I now
have the answers to these questions. As a
number of honourable senators have spoken
to me about the inquiry and have expressed
their interest in it, I might as well read the
questions and answers.
The first question was:
How many television stations are in operation at
the present time?

The answer to that question is: Nine television stations are in operation at the present
time.
The second question was:
How many of these stations are under the C.B.C?

(a) How many private television stations have
been established and in what cities and provinces
are these stations located?
The answer to the first part of that question is that five of these stations are under
the C.B.C. The answer to the second part

of the question is: Four private television
stations have been established, and they are
located at Sudbury, Ontario; London, Ontario;
Kitchener, Ontario, and Saint John, New
Brunswick.
The third question was:
Of the programs put over the C.B.C.'s television

stations, what proportion of these programs
emanate or come from the United States:
(a) What proportion of the programs emanate
or come from Great Britain?

The answer to that question is: An average
sample week for the basic network service
shows approximately 30 per cent of the programs originated in the United States, and
approximately 3 per cent in Great Britain.

The fourth question was:
What has been the total cost to date of construct-

ing and setting up the various television stations
by the C.B.C.?

The answer to that question is: The amounts
paid out for supply and construction of C.B.C.
television stations, up to February 28, 1954,
totalled $6,484,543.
The fifth question was:
What has been the cost to date of the various
television programs put over C.B.C. stations?

The answer to that question is: The cost of
television operations for the fiscal year 195253 was $2,914,882 as indicated in the annual
report of the corporation. The amounts paid
out from April 1, 1953, to February 28, 1954,
for operation of the television program service were $5,450,362.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If I am -in order I should
like to ask the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a question. He stated
that four private television stations have been
established in Canada. Is it the policy of the
government or the C.B.C. to permit an individual or single corporation to operate more
than one television station?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At the moment I am
not in a position to answer the question, but
I will endeavour to get the information. I
am sure the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and every other honourable member will appreciate that I am not
familiar with all the details of the C.B.C.'s
policy regulations.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I know it has been the
policy of the corporation to issue not more'
than one licence to any one person or any
one organization. That policy has not been
carried out, but has been violated.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That will answer the
question, then.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Euler: It is an accusation of lack
of good faith on the part of either the corporation or the government, and the leader
can take his choice.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: All I can say to the
honourable senator is that if I arm able to
obtain any additional information beyond that
which he has given, I will do so and report it
to the house.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
when the business of the day bas been completed there will remain on the order paper
nothing but a motion that this house approve
the Agreement on Commerce between Canada
and Japan, of which motion I gave notice on
April 7. Apart from the Criminal Code, it is
not expected that any legislation would come
over from the House of Commons before the
Eastern adjournrment. I am hopeful that the
code will receive third reading in that house
within the next few days. It would then come
to us and receive first reading; but there
would not be time to proceed with the second
reading, under our rules, until after the
Easter recess. As we all know, the Criminal
Code is a voluminous bill, and it occurs to me
that honourable senators will want to devote
considerable study to it, especially to any
changes made since the bill left this house a
little more than a year ago. When we reassemble after the recess, we could, with
unanimous consent, proceed with the second
reading of the bill without the customary two
days' notice. Therefore, my suggestion would
be, and I so move, that when the Senate rises
today it stand adjourned until Tuesday, May
4, at eight o'clock in the evening. I hope
that I will have the approval of the house
at that time to proceed immediately with the
second reading of the Criminal Code Bill.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, may
I inquire if it is the intention of the honourable leader to have the Criminal Code Bill
considered in committee of the whole house or
referred to the Banking and Commerce
Committee?
While I am on my feet may I make an
observation? When the code was before this
house in a previous session it was referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee, and
was dealt with in great detail by a subcommittee of that committee, which suggested
changes that were incorporated in the bill
before it was passed here. The bill is a
lengthy one, and it seems to me that the
interests of the public could best be protected
and the legislation could best be handled, by
referring the bill to the same standing committee and the same subcommittee which

dealt so thoroughly with the previous bill.
The subcommittee was composed of eminent
lawyers with wide experience in the practice
of criminal law. I have no particular knowledge on this subject, and for my part I would
be prepared to accept the judgment of that
subcommittee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In reply to the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), may I say that it is for the house
to decide whether the bill should be considered in the committee of the whole or in
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. If the bouse agreed with his suggestion that the bill be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, it would then
be for the committee to decide whether it
should be considered section by section or
referred to a subcommittee.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL HARBOURS

BOARD BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the third
reading of Bill 1-13, an Act to amend the
National Harbours Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, perhaps I
should indicate to the house the changes
which have occurred in this bill since it was
before us on second reading, when some discussion took place and criticisms were made
of one or two sections of the bill as it then
stood.
The bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications
where, with the assistance of our own Law
Clerk and the counsel for the National Harbours Board, the bill was studied very carefully. Particular attention was paid to those
sections which formed the subject of discussion on the second reading, the most
important of which was4 perhaps subsection
(1) of the new section A, empowering the
National Harbours Board to appoint police
constables, with the power of peace officers,
for the protection of property and persons
on harbour premises within the jurisdiction
of the board. That particular subsection extended the powers of police officers so
appointed to an area not more than fifty
miles distant from the property of the board.
The reason given to us for that amendment was that cases have occurred in which
property has been stolen from National Harbours Board premises and secreted some few
miles away, and that it was desired to give
the police officers appointed by the board
power to go within fifty miles of the board
premises for the purpose of following stolen
property. The committee considered the

APRIL 8. 1954
matter and unanimously agreed that was a
reasonable proposai; therefore, no major
change was made in that subsection.
Subsection 2 of that new section,' dealing
with the power of these police officers,
received a good deal of criticism on second
reading, particularly as ta the provision that
a police officer s0 appointed could take a
person charged with an offence with respect
ta National Harbours Board property before
any court possessing jurisdiction in such
cases in any area in which property under
the administration of the board was located.
It was clearly pointed out in the debate on
second reading that this subsection thearetically might mean, for instance, that a
persan charged with having committed such
an offence in Montreal could be tried on that
charge in Vancouver.
During the discussion in cominittee, the
reason for this seemingly unreasonable provision was explained in titis way: National
Harbours Board property, in the case of a
number of harbours, extends over a good
many magisterial jurisdictions, and when an
offence has been committed it is sometimes
difficuit ta be precise as ta what is the proper
jurisdiction. That may be a logical excuse
for seeking a provision of titis kind; neyertheless, the committee feit that the wording
of the subsection went much too far. The
committee therefore proposed an amendment,
which is incorporated in the bll as it now
cames before the house on the third reading,
which limits the jurisdiction of the court.
Perhaps 1 should read the amendment:
but no court shail so deal with such person if the
act or omission is alleged to have occurred outslde
the province or at a place more than flty miles
distant from the place where the court is sittmng.

In other words, we limited the jurisdiction
of a court ta deal with an offence af this
kind: the court must be within fifty miles of
the place where the offence was alleged ta
have been committed and in the samne province. That was the principal amendment
which was made ta the bill in committee.
There were a number of other amendments
of a more or less minor character. Having
regard ta the discussion which took place on
titis bill on second reading I thought that an
explanation was due ta the Senate o! the
changed formn in which the bil now cames
before us on third reading.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

a result of the work of the Criminal Code
Revision Commission which studied the subject-matter for a number of years. At the
1952 session our Banking and Commerce
Committee made some sixty-three amendments to that bill. At the following session
a redrafted bill, incorporating in the main
the amendments which had been proposed by
the Senate, was introduced in this chamber;
and after the bill had been studied by the
same committee
and a subcommittee,
approximately 116 changes were made, some
substantial and some more or less minor.
The bill with those amendments was then
sent to the House of Commons, and it was
considered in a committee of that house that
session. At the present session the bill was
introduced in the House of Commons, as
Bill No. 7, incorporating some of the changes
proposed by the committee last session.
The bill as it now comes before us, after
further study by the House of Commons and
one of its committees this session, contains
some seventy-one changes from the bill
which we passed and sent to that house.
Some of the changes amount simply to a
rephrasing of certain sections without, in my
view, effecting any change in the substance
of those sections. Other changes involve
changes in penalty, which in most instances
would represent an increase in penalty. But

a number of changes have to do with sections which in my view are controversial,
some of which sections the Senate took a
very decided stand on when the bill was
before it, and I want to comment particularly
on the treatment those sections received in
the Commons. I do not propose to deal with
all the seventy-one changes. If the patience
of honourable senators does not run out I
may deal with a number of them, but certainly with not more than 50 per cent. With
some of them I may deal fully; with others,
very casually.
The first section I wish to refer to in Bill 7
is section 9, which was section 8(2) in the
bill we sent to the Commons. The subjectmatter of that section is contempt of court.
Even at the present time there is no appeal
provided from a conviction for contempt of
court.
When the matter was originally
before the Senate committee we felt it was
a very drastic, very arbitrary power which
could be exercised by a judge or magistrate.
The circumstances in which he would be
called upon or permitted to exercise that
power would be peculiar. Usually the contempt, if it took place other than in the face
of the court, would be brought to his attention, he would order the offender to be
called before him, he would read the article
or statement complained of and if he decided
there was contempt of court he would impose
the penalty; and there was no appeal from
the conviction or sentence. Likewise, there
was no appeal from the conviction or sentence of a person for contempt committed in
the face of the court-that is, before the
judge or magistrate who finds the person
guilty and imposes the sentence.
We felt that that was basically wrong and
provided for an appeal in this fashion: we
said that where a person was convicted of
contempt in the face of the court-where a
person during proceedings in court was
guilty of conduct or of making remarks which
could be construed as holding the court or
judge up to ridicule or contempt, and where
in the interest of maintaining the decorum
and dignity of the court the judge should be
given strong powers-such a person should
be allowed a right of appeal from the sentence only. It might very well happen that
the judge, under pressure of the circumstances-for judges are human-would impose a penalty which upon reflection he
would regard as being a bit too severe.
On the other hand, we provided a right
of appeal both as to conviction and sentence
for contempt not committed in the face of
the court.
The House of Commons, in its consideration of the measure, changed the section to

SENATE
provide a right of appeal against conviction
for contempt in any event, whether it took
place in the face of the court or otherwise.
However, the proposed right of appeal is not
an absolute right, but is subject to leave
being given by the court of appeal or a
judge of that court.
Honourable senators may feel, as I do,
that the right of appeal should be an absolute right, and not subject to leave being
given. The value of the right of appeal, in
my thinking, lies in the absolute nature of
that right. In these circumstances, our committee might very well give further consideration to this question of contempt of
court, and decide whether perhaps our earlier
thinking on the subject was correct, or
whether we should accept the change made
by the House of Commons.
Perhaps I should add that the subject of
contempt of court has been given particular
prominence lately. I am not attempting to
express any opinion on convictions under
that charge, because without a full statement of the facts it would be very dangerous
But one recent case which struck
to do so.
me rather forcibly was that of a news dealer
who was sent to jail because some offending
magazines were found on his counter. His
explanation apparently was that under his
contract he could only get a supply of certain
publications if he accepted certain other
publications which were sent to him and
over which he had no right of selection. I
may say that New York State has recently
realized the danger of such a contract, and
has introduced a law making it illegal.
Nevertheless, this charge to which I refer
certainly placed the news vendor in a most
difficult situation. He was charged with contempt and he defended himself in the only
way he could. There seemed to be some merit
to his defence; nevertheless he went to jail.
I am not suggesting that the judge was arbitrary, but it was an arbitrary exercise of an
absolute power; and in the interests of justice
and democracy there should be a means by
which the correctness of such a charge and
conviction could be tested as of right by an
appeal.
I wish to refer briefly to section 33 of the
bill, which section, by the way, bore the
same number in the bill that we sent to
the House of Commons. That section has
to do with the duties of officers at the time
the riot act is read. As the bill went to
the Commons it contained a provision that
if death or injury resulted to persons assembled, the peace officers or any person
drafted to aid them could not be charged in
any civil or criminal proceedings in respect
of any such death or injury. The Commons

chose to restrict that protection of officers to
proceedings brought in respect of any death
or injury that is caused "by reason of resistance" to the performance of duty by peace
officers and those assisting them. Possibly
that is a reasonable restriction. I have no
strong views on it one way or the other, and
I simply pass it on without comment.
We next come to a section which provoked
considerable discussion in the other place.
That is section 46, idealing with treason.
Section 46 of the bill as it originally came
before us, as drafted by the Revision Commission, provided in section 46(1):
Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
(e) conspires with an agent of a state other than
Canada to communicate information or to do an act
that is likely to be prejudicial to the safety or
interests of Canada.

Now, as the result of our deliberations on
that section we concluded that this was a
departure from the well-known concept of
what constituted treason, and while we were
perfectly prepared to provide a penalty for
an offence of the character described by the
words I have read we felt that we should not
confuse the concept of treason by calling such
an offence treason; so we took that paragraph
(e)out of section 46 and put it into section
50, under which the act described in the
paragraph became an offence, and we provided for a penalty of fourteen years. We
also made one change in the phrase "prejudicial to the safety or interests of Canada", by
striking out the words "or interests". Well,
the Commons restored paragraph (e) to section 46, with some change in the language, and
made the act treason. So the proposed section
46(1) now reads:
Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
(e) without lawful authority, communicates or
makes available to an agent of a state other than
Canada, military or scientific information or any
sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a
military or scientific character that he knows or
ought to know may be used by that state for a
purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of
Canada.

It will be noted that that language is more
particular, and the elimination of the words
"or interests" by the Senate has been confirmed in the amendment. Also, the unlawful
communication is not of information in the
broad term as used originally, but it is now
information of a military or scientific character, and the paragraph goes on to elaborate
on that.
Having regard to the way in which international affairs are now carried on and have
been carried on for some time, the developments in modern methods of warfare, the
importance of scientific information in relation thereto, and the know-how in connection
with these processes, it may now be more
important than ever that a country should be

MAY 5, 1954
able, by the most drastic penalties possible,
to safeguard that information and to provide
against its possible communication to other
countries where it could be used against the
best interests of Canada. It may be that, as
schemes of defence against modern developments in warfare are progressive things, with
developments occurring from day to day, their
importance to the safety and defence of the
country is such that we must be prepared to
treat the communication of information about
them to the agent of a foreign state as the
most serious offence, so far as Canada is concerned, that a person can commit, and term
it treason-a word which denotes the most
awful offence of which one can be guilty in
relation to his own country. In any event,
the Commons has included this offence under
the heading of "treason". I think the section
itself is now much better phrased. There are
still attached the qualifying words that the
purpose for which the information is communicated must be prejudicial to the safety
or defence of Canada.
In this connection I would refer honourable
senators to section 47, which prescribes the
penalties, and in which several changes have
been made. For treason in its original concept, embodied in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
of section 46, the penalty of death is retained;
for the offences indicated in paragraphs (d),
(f) and (g), the penalty may be death or life
imprisonment. In the case of the particular
subsection to which I have been referring, and
which I have read to you, relative to the
communication of military or scientific information, the penalty is to be death or life
imprisonment if a state of war then exists
between Canada and another country at the
time the information is communicated; but if
there is not a state of war, the penalty is
fourteen years.
It may be that, as a result of all the discussion which has gone on, with the weighing
of all points of view, the method of treatment which is here set before us is by and
large a satisfactory way of dealing with the
matter, and that we should not feel that,
because heretofore treason has been identified
only with offences of a certain character,
there are not circumstances under which the
concept should be enlarged. My own view is
that if the application of the term "treason"
to the communication of information under
these circumstances is more likely to strike
terror in the heart of some person or persons
who may be urged to so communicate information of this kind, one may be perfectly content to have such acts described as treason.
Section 50, to which some amendments
have been made, is included in the same
group of sections as those pertaining to
treason. As I have already stated, paragraph

(c) of section 50, relating to the conveying
of information, has been removed from that
section and returned to section 46. I have
no comment to make on the addition to
paragraph (a) of the words "wilfully assists".
I come now to a series of sections which
are, I believe, the kernel of this matter,
and I should like to discuss them together.
I refer to sections 52, 365 and 372. I should
like to take a few moments to tell the house
what these sections embody, what the
practice has been in respect of them, and
perhaps express some views about them.
Section 52 is known as the sabotage section,
section 365 as the criminal breach of contract
section, and section 372 as the mischief
section.
Under section 52 the basic element of
sabotage is that the prohibited act must be
prejudicial to the safety, security or defence
of Canada, or the safety or security of the
naval, army or air forces of any state other
than Canada that are lawfully present in
Canada. A "prohibited !a.ct" is then defined
as being an act or omission that impairs the
efficiency or impedes the working of any
vessel, vehicle, aircraft, machinery, apparatus
or other thing, or causes property, by whomsoever it may be owned, to be lost, damaged
or destroyed.
That is the essence of
sabotage.
As defined in section 365, criminal breach
of contract stems from acts which may result
in endangering life, causing serious bodily
injury, endangering property, depriving
citizens of certain services or delaying or
preventing the running of trains. I would
point out, however, that an 'offence of criminal
breach of contract might not be sabotage, for
in the case of sabotage the act must be
prejudicial to the safety, security or defence
of Canada. An act of mischief is also something that falls below the character of being
prejudicial to the state.
Having made these general observations
I shall proceed to state what was done by
the Senate. The bill which originally came
before us restated more or less the existing
law in those three sections, which we passed
without any amendment providing for a
saving clause exempting any group or groups
of people from the application of those provisions. Thus the sections, as passed by the
Senate, simply restated the present law. I
would point out that section 372 represented
an attempt to restate in one section what
is contained in perhaps as many as twenty
sections in the present code. The House of
Commons added saving clauses, both in the
same language, to sections 52 and 372. The
saving clause in section 52 provides:
No person does a prohibited act within the meaning of this section by reason only that

SENATE
(a) he stops work as a result of the failure of his
employer and himself to agree upon any matter
relating to his employment,
(b) he stops work as a result of the failure of
his employer and a bargaining agent acting on his
behalf te agree upon any matter relating to his
employment, or
(c) he stops work as a result of his taking part
in a combination of workmen or employees for
their own reasonable protection as workmen or
employees.

Subsection (4) was also added, as follows:
No person does a prohibited act within the
meaning of this section by reason only that he
attends at or near or approaches a dwelling bouse
or place for the purpose only of obtaining or communicating information.

That same saving clause was added to
section 372, but the saving clause added to
section 365 was different. Reference was
made by an honourable senator to the treatment that was given to section 365, his comment being based on the saving clause that
was embodied by the Commons in section
365, but that clause underwent considerable
amendment before appearing in its present

form in Bill 7. It now reads:
(2) No person wilfully breaks a contract within
the meaning of subsection (1) by reason only that
(a) being the employee of an employer, he stops
work as a result of the failure of his employer and
himself to agree upon any matter relating to his
employment . . .

The next part is the important one:
(b) being a member of an organization of
employees formed for the purpose of regulating
relations between employers and employees, he
stops work as a result of the failure of the
employer and a bargaining agent acting on behalf
of the organization to agree upon any matter relating to the employment of members of the
organization,
if, before the stoppage of work occurs, all steps
provided by law with respect to the settlement of
industrial disputes are taken and any provision for
the final settlement of differences, without stoppage
of work, contained in er by law deemed to be
contained in a collective agreement is complied
with and effect given thereto.

In addition a new clause has been added:
(3) No proceedings shall be instituted under tbis
section without the consent of the Attorney
General.

Hon. Mr. Aseline: Is that the section
about which some honourable senators have
received correspondence? I have received at
least half a dozen letters requesting me not
to vote in favour of Bill 7, in order to preserve
the freedom of the people of Canada, and all
that sort of thing.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know, of course,
what is contained in the correspondence you
have received. I know that I myself have
received letters dealing with these three sections. I think that by and large the labour
organizations feel that if section 365 is at all
necessary it is in its most acceptable form

as it appears in the bill before us. The section simply says this: If property damage
results from a workman walking off the job
at a time when all steps provided by his contract and by law with respect to the settlement of industrial disputes have been taken,
and there are no other steps to be taken short
of legal strike, then the saving clause in the
section would apply if the act of walking off
the job was not a wilful one. The House of
Commons attempted to provide a further protection against any multiplicity of prosecutions by providing that no prosecution can
take place under this section without the
consent of the Attorney General of the province. Frankly, I can see no objection to the
form in which the section now appears. If
a walkout occurred after all negotiation proceedings had been exhausted, and when there
was a right to strike, I would think that even
without the saving clause there is inherent
in the section the right of a workman to walk
out as long as he did not wilfully break a
contract. If he quit work after his right
was exhausted, and damage to property
resulted, and he was charged with criminal
breach of contract, I think it would be a good
defence in law for him to say, "My contract
is at an end for this purpose". In my view,
therefore, all that the saving clause does
is to make explicit what I regard as already
implicit in the section, even without the
saving clause. Therefore, I have no criticism
to offer.
I have indicated the view of the labour
organizations; and I think even management
has said, in similar language, that if there
must be a saving clause the paragraph now
in section 364 is the best that could be donc,
and it is satisfactory to them.
I cannot look with equal approval upon
section 52, which deals with sabotage, or section 372, with mischief. The two sections
are entirely different. Section 372 bas to do
with wilful damage to any property, but
section 52 goes farther and affects the safety,
security and defence of the state. The saving
clause has been added in both sections, and
operates in this way: If a workman engaged
by an employer, where there is a contract of
employment, decides to quit his job to go and
join a picket line to help other members of
his union who are on strike at another plant
having no relationship te the plant from
which he quit, the saving clause permits him
to do so. May I point out that the language
of the section is that be is not guilty of
an offence under that section by reason only
of doing so. In order to indicate to honourable senators what was intended, I will read
what the Minister of Justice and Mr. Knowles
said in the other place. In dealing with these

MAY 5, 1954

Now we know the purpose of the saving to me that by adding this saving clause in
clause is to permit workmen, in violation of the language as given we are attempting to
a contract so far as the offence of sabotage excuse what otherwise might be sabotage in
is concerned, to quit work to go and join a relation to the safety, security or defence of

there was a contract, the nature of the contract and the circumstances under which the
men walked out.
Honourable senators, I am sorry that I have
taken more time than I intended on those
sections, but they strike me as being of considerable importance; certainly, the House
of Commons spent some time on them. I may
add that representations were made to the
Commons which were not made to us with
respect to the saving clauses. I do not say
that I resent that sort of thing, but I do think
we should have had the opportunity of considering them, because we had the bill before
us for a long time and we gave serious consideration to that subject. However, it is
before us now.
I should like now to consider a group of
sections, namely 64 to 69, and particularly
section 69, which have to do with unlawful

assemblies and riots. Bill O, which we sent
to the House of Commons, provided that once
the riot act has been read people must
immediately disperse. The problem has come
up as to what is meant by "immediately".
Apparently some police officers immediately
went into action upon the riot act having been
read by the mayor or other official. This gave
rise to complaints and disorders. As a result
the House of Commons has provided an
amendment to the effect that people must
disperse and depart within thirty minutes
after the reading of the riot act.
The next section to which I would refer
in passing is section 88. By the way, I
should say that from section 88 onwards the
section numbers in the new bill correspond
with those in Bill O, which we sent to the
House of Commons.
Honourable members of the other house
were so disturbed about the threat of what
are normally called switch-knives or springknives that they added to section 88 subsection 3, which explicitly provides that:
Everyone who without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him, bas in his possession or sells,
barters, gives, lends, transfers or delivers a springknife or switch-knife is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

It was hoped that by setting out this specific
provision in the code, merchants would be
discouraged from selling this type of knife
to youngsters who feel it is a smart thing to
be equipped with a knife on which the pressing of a button or lever causes the blade to
swing into action.
Section 102 of the bill is a section which
I should think, after having been a member
of this house for some years, would be of
no interest to honourable senators. However,
I might in passing tell you the nature of the
section. It has to do with the matter of subscribing to what might be .called party funds.

The opening words of subsection 2 of that
section in Bill O, as sent on to the House
of Commons, read as follows:
Everyone commits an offence who, being a party
to a contract with the government directly or
indirectly subscribes, gives or agrees to subscribe
or give, to any person any valuable consideration-

Incidentally, I do not think that valuable
consideration includes the making of speeches;
at least, it has not been interpreted as such.
Some discussion took place on this particular
subject in the Commons, and as a result an
amendment was adopted which I think honourable senators would appreciate as being
very satisfactory. Subsection 2, as amended,
now reads:
Everyone commits an offence who, in order to
obtain or retain a contract with the government,
or as a term of any such contract, whether express
or implied, directly or indirectly subscribes, gives
or agrees to subscribe or give, to any person any
valuable consideration-

This clearly expresses the matter, so that he
who runs may read and understand what
the true situation is. It may not be said to
be in any way inhibitory. Perhaps I should
add that the penalty for an offence under
this section is imprisonment for five years.
I turn next to section 116, which deals with
a witness who gives contradictory evidence or
who perjures himself. Of course we all
share the feeling that the proper conduct of
our courts is a most important thing, and one
of the strongest contributing elements is the
ability to rely on testimony being honestly
given. Truc, it may not always be a faithful
statement of the facts, but at least we would
hope that it is honestly given. And to assure
that it will be honestly given, we provided in
Bill O that a person who has given contradictory evidence on two different occasions
could be charged with an indictable offence,
and the onus was on him to defend himself
by establishing that none of the evidence
was given with the intention to mislead the
court. The House of Commons has adopted
a little more lenient approach to that question by placing upon the crown the onus
to establish certain things. Part of subsection
1 of section 116 reads as follows:
. . . but no person shall be convicted under this
section unless the court, judge or magistrate, as the
case may be, is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused, in giving evidence in either of
the judicial proceedings, intended to mislead.

In other words, it reverses the proof.
There is the further safety clause provided
by subsection 3 of section 116 which reads as
follows:

because a witness changed his story, could
not prosecute without the leave of the
Attorney General. Although section 116, as
we submitted it to the House of Commons
in Bill 0, was somewhat stiffer, I have no
comment to make on the amendment.
Section 120 deals with the question of
public mischief. In Bill 0 the opening words
of that section read:
Every one who causes a peace officer to enter
upon an investigation wilfullyThe Commons thought there might be some
confusion in the interpretation of those words,
and amended them to read:
Every one who, with intent to mislead, causes a
peace officer to enter upon an investigation byIt is a clarification, and I do not think it
seriously changes the scope of the section.
In section 131, which deals with the question of corroboration in certain types of
sexual ofTences, the Commons added section
142 to the group of sections under which a
material particular of the evidence given
must be corroborated before there can be a
conviction.
Next I will mention section 150, on the
question of crime-comics.
I commend to
honourable members a careful reading of
this section, and particularly subsection 7
(b). Frankly, I have some doubt whether
that paragraph (b), which was put in by
the Commons, adds anything of substance
but it contains some nice sounding words in
any event.
Section 164, which has to do with what we
might ordinarily describe as the offence of
vagrancy, was the subject of considerable
discussion in the Commons. In the form in
which the bill was sent over from the Senate
that section said:

if there was a possibility of misinterpretation
I think the change, which removes any reason for doubt, is good.
Section 250 deals with the publication of
defamatory libel known to be false, section
251 with the publication of defamatory libel,
and section 252 with extortion by libel. In
these three sections all that the Commons
has done has been to increase the penalties.
For instance, in section 250 of the bill as we
passed it the penalty provided was imprisonment for two years or a fine of $5,000 or
both, and the Commons provided for a
straight term of imprisonment of five years
with no provision for a fine. Section 251 as
we sent it forward to the Commons provided
for a penalty of imprisonment of two years
or a fine of $1,000 or both, and the Commons
made the penalty two years. In section 252,
for extortion by libel, we provided for a
penalty of two years or a fine of $1,000 or
both, and the Commons substituted a term

of imprisonment for five years without any
provision for a fine.

Section 295 deals with possession of housebreaking, vault-breaking and safe-breaking
instruments. This section as we passed it
read:
Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof
of which lies upon him,
(a) has in his possession any instrument for
house-breaking, vault-breaking of safe-breaking, or
(b) has his face masked or coloured or is otherwise disguised,
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for fourteen years.
The Commons rephrased that to provide for
a penalty of fourteen years where there was

possession of any instrument for housebreaking or vault-breaking, etc., but for a
penalty of only ten years if the convicted
person had his face masked or coloured or

a large number of sections where the changes
There may have been some justification did not, in my opinion, involve any change
for the concern over the former wording, and in substance. We can refer to them and

SENATE
call for an explanation and understanding
of them in committee, but I do not want to
take time to deal with them here.
Section 328 deals with fraudulent concealment of documents of title, etc., and the
Commons saw fit to add a clause requiring
the consent of the Attorney General ta
prosecute in such a case.
The Commons altered the penalty in section 339, which has to do with the salting
of a mine and the salting of a sample taken
from a mine. The penalty in the bill as it
left the Senate was five years, but the Commons saw fit to increae it to ten years.
In section 341 there is a change, but it
is only a rephrasing and we do not need to
ae concerned about it at this time.
Section 343 creates an offence of making,
circulating or publishing a false prospectus,
and the Commons increased the penalty
from five to ten years.
I have already dealt with sections 365 and
372, so I do not need to spend any time on
them now.
Next I want to refer to section 432, which
deals with the detention of things seized
under a search warrant. It will be recalled
that in the Senate bill this section provided
that when things are seized under a search
warrant they must be brought as quickly as
possible to the justice who authorized the
issue of the search warrant. The changes
made by the Commons in this section are
lengthy, but all they do is to provide in more
detail for the manner of disposal of goods
which have been seized under search warrant when they are no longer required for
the purposes for which they were seized.
Section 438 is an important section. It
deals with a situation where a person has
been arrested without warrant and, it may
be, by a person who is not a peace officer.
In the section as passed by us it was provided that anyone who arrests a person without warrant shall deliver that person to a
peace officer, and that the peace officer shall,
as soon as possible, bring such person before
a justice to be dealt with according to law.
Apparently it was felt in the Commons that
the term "as soon as possible" was not
precise enough, so the section was amended
to provide that where a person who has been
arrested without warrant is delivered to a
peace officer, the peace officer must, if a
justice is available, bring him within twentyfour hours before that justice, and if a justice is not available within that period of
twenty-four hours the peace officer must
bring him before some justice "as soon as
possible". I cite these facts to illustrate the
great care and consideration which this section has received. We have an interpretation
of "as soon as possible".

I now draw attention to a rather important
section. Section 481 provided for the continuance of proceedings where a judge or
magistrate was unable to act. The clause as
approved by us was rejected by the Commons and replaced by a much lengthier one
which spells out in considerable detail what
steps must be taken. For instance, if the
judge or magistrate before whom a trial is
commenced dies, or for any reason is unable
to continue, certain provisions are made applicable. If he had got to the stage of
adjudication, but had not imposed sentence,
some other magistrate may step in and
impose sentence. If he had not got to the
stage of adjudication, the judge or magistrate
who substitutes for him will start de novo:
and procedures to cover these situations are
outlined. The only difference I can see is
that, in the form in which the section was
passed by this bouse the procedure could have
been worked out by regulations or rules of
criminal practice; but in its present form
the section eliminates the necessity for rules
by spelling out the procedures in the various
subsections of section 481.
Section 628, as revised, deals with compensation for loss of property. It is provided
that a court which convicts an accused of
an indictable offence may award, out of
moneys found in the possession of the accused
at the time of his arrest, "an amount by way
of satisfaction or compensation for loss of or
damage to property suffered . . ." Again we

find a somewhat elaborate procedure attached
to the section as amended. In the circumstances I have mentioned it is provided that
the judge may order an accused to pay to the
aggrieved person an amount by way of satisfaction or compensation for loss of or damage
to property, and where the amount so ordered
to be paid is not paid forthwith, the applicant
may, by filing the order, have it entered as
a judgment in the Superior Court in that
particular case, and all the incidents that
attach to a judgment of record will then follow for the purposes of ensuring the collection of the money.
Under section 629 we have exactly the
same situation in relation to compensation to
bona fide purchasers. Where somebody has
stolen goods and sold them to someone else
who is a bona fßde purchaser, a procedure is
spelled out as to how that purchaser may,
when a conviction is made, get an order of the
judge for reimbursement of the amount of
money which had been paid for the goods,
and the judgment is enforceable in the same
manner as if it were a judgment of a court
of record.
I think honourable senators will be interested in section 631, which deals with the

MAY 5, 1954
costs in proceedings by indictment for defamatory libel. The section sent to the
Commons provided that a successful defendant in a prosecution for defamatory
libel would be entitled to his costs. The
section as amended by the Commons provides that the reasonable costs of the successful party may be recovered. This means
that, whichever side is successful, the costs
follow the event.
Section 632 is merely consequential upon
the clause to which I have just referred.
I turn now to section 641, with the remark
that honourable senators may begin to
breathe more easily, as we are within one
hundred sections of the end of the bill. Subsection (3) of section 641, as passed in this
chamber, provided that every sentence of
whipping should be carried out in accordance
with regulations to be made by the Governor
in Council. Apparently honourable members
of the other place felt some concern about
what these regulations might be, because
they have spelled out in subsection (3) and
in new subsections (4) and (5) the conditions
under which a sentence of whipping will be
administered. Provision is made for the type
of instrument to be used, the circumstances
under which whippings may occur, and for
supervision by a medical practitioner. In
short, instead of leaving these matters to be
determined by regulations of the Governor
in Council, specific directions are incorporated in the section itself.
Section 690 is one of a group of clauses
relating to extraordinary remedies. The particular one with which it deals is where an
application has been made for habeas corpus.
In the bill as passed by us it was provided
that, where an application for habeas corpus
had been refused, successive applications
could not be made. I presume that honourable members of the House of Commons
became a little concerned as to whether or
not that was sufficiently clear, so they added
the words "on the merits". In other words,
if the application for the habeas corpus is
refused on the merits, then successive applications cannot follow.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Who makes that
decision?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I suppose that if a person tried to fly in the face of the law by
attempting another application he would be
refused on the basis of this section. I admit
that putting in the words "on the merits"
might promote quite a scope of argument as
to whether or not the merits had actually
been gone into. Under the section passed by
the Senate there was certainly some finality
to the proceedings.
In passing I should like to draw attention to
section 691, providing for appeals in habeas

corpus, mandamus, certiorari,and other proceedings of that kind. In their concern that
these appeals should be promptly heard, the
Commons inserted subsection (3), which specifically provides that the appeal of an appellant who has filed notice of appeal shali be
heard within seven days after the filing of
proof of service of the notice of appeal upon
the respondent and, where a notice of appeal
is filed when the court of appeal is not sitting, a special sittings of the court of appeal
shall be convened for the purpose of hearing
the appeal. This clause is no doubt justified,
but in my view it provides something that
might have been covered by the rules of
criminal procedure.
I should like to refer to section 743, to
which the Commons added a new subsection (5):
(5) The Attorney General of Canada has the
same rights of appeal in proceedings instituted at
the instance of the Government of Canada and conducted by or on behalf of that government as the
Attorney General of a province has under this Part.

This has to do with appeals following trials
de novo. In certain circumstances a trial de
novo may be held before a county court judge,
following an appeal from a conviction or an
acquittal by a magistrate. There is a provision
elsewhere in the code for an appeal on any
question of law.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Are the offices of
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada always held by the same person?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Those offices may be
held by the same person and usually are. At
the present time the Minister of Justice is
also the Attorney General of Canada.
I should direct the attention of the house
to section 746, which deals with the transition between the operation of the present code
and the new code. For instance, the section
provides for the handling of cases where
offenders charged under the present code
are not brought to trial until the new code
is in operation.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I interrupt the honourable gentleman to ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Davies: On several occasions you
have said that certain things cannot be done
without the permission of the Attorney General. I take it that you have been referring
to the Attorney General of Canada and not
to provincial Attorneys General?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, I have been referring
to the Attorneys General of the provinces.
I should have referred honourable senators
to section 744, which deals with fees and
allowances that may be allowed to peace

peace officers the mileage rate of 20 cents
which we proposed has been reduced to 10
cents per mile. The fee for witnesses has
been increased from $3 to $4 per day, and
the mileage rate has been reduced from 20
cents to 10 cents per mile. The allowances
for living expenses of interpreters has been
increased from $5 to $10 per day, and here
again the mileage rate reduced from 20 cents
to 10 cents per mile. In other words, the
Commons increased the per diem allowance
for witnesses and interpreters over what
the Senate had provided, but reduced the
mileage rate.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: What was the recommendation of the Senate as to the per diem
rate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: We set the rate for
witnesses at $3 per day.
Honourable senators, I have covered all
the sections which I deem of sufficient importance to call to your attention at this
time. I believe I have dealt with thirty
of the seventy-one amendments that have
been made by the Commons, and it may be
felt that some of the others should be discussed in this chamber or in committee. I

felt it was unnecessary to deal with amendments which merely involve rephrasing without change in substance. I referred to changes
in penalties where I thought it might be
useful to call these changes to the attention
of the house. The substantial changes are
not many and are confined to the important
headings of treason, sabotage, wilful breach
of contract, mischief, contempt of court and
possibly a few others. Those are the major
ones that loom up at this time. In the process of boiling, which has gone on in our
consideration of the various drafts of this
code over a period of two or three years,
many problems have been worked out and
common ground reached. Certain others remain and some may prove to be very
contentious. I hope that my presentation of
today may be of some assistance to honourable senators in their deliberations of this
matter.

I should like to ask the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if
there are any new developments on the St.
Lawrence Seaway project which he can report
to the members of the house.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before coming into the house this afternoon I was informed from a source which
I have generally found to be very reliable,
the Canadian Press, that the House of Representatives in the United States had given final
approval to that country's participation in the
seaway phase of the St. Lawrence River and
Great Lakes. Mr. Kelly, the representative
of the Canadian Press in the Senate Press
Gallery, informed me that the vote was 241

at Ottawa. The purpose of that amendment,
honourable senators will recall, was to enable
people who lived in outlying districts to send
their declarations direct to Ottawa instead of
having to travel to the nearest county or
district town to swear to their affidavits and
so forth.
I will now read the first part of section
10 (1) as it will appear if this bill is passed:
The minister may, in his discretion, grant a certificate of citizenship to any person who is not a
Canadian citizen and who makes application for
that purpose and satisfies the court that,-

And this is the proposed amendment:

or he is the spouse of and resides in Canada with

At the present time only under special
circumstances can a certificate of citizenship
be obtained by any person under twenty-one
years of age, except by a person who is the
spouse of a Canadian citizen. Perhaps I could
make that clearer by an illustration. Suppos-

CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill C-15, an Act to amend the
Canadian Citizenship Act.
He said: Honourable senators, as I mentioned on Tuesday evening, when this bill
received first reading, the purpose of the
bill is to enable a person to apply for Canadian citizenship without first giving, as he
is now required to do, at least one year's
notice of his intention to apply. Under the
act as it now stands an applicant for citizenship may file a declaration of intention after
he has attained eighteen years of age, provided he does so not less than one nor more
than six years before the application is
heard. Section 10 (1) of the act says:
The minister may, In his discretion, grant a
certificate of citizenship to any person who is not
a Canadian citizen and who makes application for
that purpose and satisfies the court that,
(a) either he has filed in the office of the clerk
of the court for the judicial district in which he
resides . . . not less than one nor more than six

years prior to the date of his application, a deolara83280-29

dian citizen who resides in Canada, she can
become a Canadian citizen. And under
present legislation she does not have to file
a declaration of intention, so the bill makes
no change in this respect so far as any such
person is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Reid: She would have to apply for
citizenship, though, would she not?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, she would have
to apply. It has always been necessary for
such a person to apply, but she does not have
to file a declaration of intention.
The amendment also deletes the words
"or he is a British subject". Of course, a
British subject never did have to file a
declaration of intention to become a Canadian citizen, and it is not necessary to retain
these words in the act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would such an immigrant
from Holland have to wait five years before
she received her citizenship papers?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Does she not automatically
become a Canadian citizen?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald No. She could become
a Canadian citizen in less than five years if
she marries a Canadian citizen who resides
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is citizenship status a
prerequisite in any way to participation in
family allowances and old age pensions?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: She would have to
reside in Canada for twenty years in order
to qualify for an old age pension.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Whether or not she has
taken out citizenship papers she would be
eligible for an old age pension?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Provided she has
lived in Canada twenty years.
Hon. Mr. Davies: What about family allowances?
Hon. Mr. Euler: That depends upon whether
she has any children.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I did not look up that
point. Of course, we are not concerned with
the Family Allowances Act, but my recollection is that children become eligible for
family alowances if they have been born in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Family allowances are payable to permanently admitted immigrants,
upon application, after one year's residence
in Canada. But in order to become eligible
for an old age pension, as the honourable
minister (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has just said,
a person has to live in Canada twenty years.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe I have
explained the bill fully, except that I have not
answered a question by the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). He
asked how long a woman immigrant, of a
nationality other than Canadian, has to wait
to become a Canadian citizen. My understanding is that if she marries a Canadian
who resides in Canada she can make applicaI will
tion for citizenship immediately.
verify that, however, and if I am wrong I
will let the bouse know.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If she is the wife of a Canadian citizen can she apply before she comes
to this country?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, she could not.
The amendment reads: "he bas attained the
age of twenty-one years, or be is the spouse
of and resides in Canada with a Canadian
citizen." To become a Canadian she would
have to reside in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Under the act as it is at
present, a declaration of intention must be
made one year before the application is heard

by a judge. I trust that now the period that
the wife of a Canadian citizen has to wait will
be shortened.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As has been stated,
hitherto a person making an application has
been required to file a declaration of intention
one year before his application is made. Under
these conditions, one immigrant from a
foreign country, having filed immediately
upon arrival a declaration of intention, could
after five years file his application for citizenship; but another person, no less worthy,
who had come to Canada and lived in this
country for five or, say, ten years and established himself here, might have to wait still
another year before he could become a citizen. For example, if be filed his declaration
of intention in the tenth year, he could not
file his application for citizenship until the
eleventh year of his residence.
My information is that the department is
adequately staffed to inquire into and deal
within three months with applications for
citizenship; but at the present time a declaration of intention, although it is handled
promptly, must remain on the office files until
a year bas expired; so that except under very
urgent and special circumstances an applicant cannot become a Canadian citizen before
that time has elapsed.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I welcome this bill and the change which it
brings about in abolishing the necessity of
this declaration of intention one year before
naturalization can be granted. Under the
normal procedure a citizen of a foreign
country who comes to Canada must wait five
years before he can be naturalized. Quite a
number of immigrants have been unaware
that a declaration of intention had to be filed
a year before they could be naturalized, and
upon applying for naturalization, after living
in the country for five years, they have
found they had to wait still another year. I
have never been able to satisfy myself as
to the utility of this declaration of intention.
I suppose that at the time it was introduced
the purpose was to give the department a
one-year period in which to inquire into the
bona fides of an applicant before finally granting him naturalization.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: There is a similar regulation in the United States, and I think we
were just following their policy.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That may be so. Perhaps this is another instance which shows
that we should not always follow the United
States.
I wanted to say that what the bill proposes
is a good departure. I welcome the abolition of the really unnecessary preliminary
requirement of a declaration of intention.

MAY 6, 1954
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if it
is intended that this legislation should apply
equally to all immigrants applying for Canadian citizenship? For instance, will it apply
equally to people coming from Great Britain
and those coming from the continent?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think there
will be any change in respect ta that matter
by virtue of this legislation.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I am sure that we all approve of
this bill, and while I have no special comment ta make I rise ta express my pleasure
at what is being done. It is obvious that as
far as possible we should remove every
technical difficulty that stands in the way of
our new citizens becoming truly citizens of
Canada. An applicant for Canadian citizenship must meet substantive requirements as
ta residence, but once he has done so we
should make it as easy as possible for him ta
acquire citizenship. Along with the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), I welcome the sweeping away of
this technical difficulty which has stood in
the path of some Canadian residents from
becoming Canadian citizens. I compliment
the government upon bringing in the bill.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I entirely agree with the remarks just made
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). Like him, I
have had many occasions ta deal with matters of this kind in our courts. The basic
provision of the act is that a person who is
not a Canadian citizen may become one if
he has been admitted ta this country for
permanent residence and has lived here continuously for a period of five years. Any
such person who desires ta become a Canadian citizen must apply for a certificate of
citizenship, and notice ta that effect must be
posted in the local court house for a period
of three months, during which period the
appropriate security officers scrutinize his
application and carry out the necessary
investigations.
In addition, under the provision which this
bill seeks ta repeal, be has been required ta
file a declaration of intention ta become a
Canadian citizen, and his application could
not be granted until twelve months after
that declaration has been filed. I have known
of cases of desirable citizens who, after
living continuously in Canada for five years
and applying for a certificate of citizenship,
have had ta wait a whole year longer before
obtaining a certificate of citizenship because
they had omitted ta file such a declaration.
Therefore I welcome this amendment: it
will simplify the procedure. The period of
83280-29J

three months during which the application is posted should give the security
officers sufficient time ta carry out their
investigation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And I understand that
if more time is required for the investigation
it may be granted.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, and the applicant has
ta wait. Furthermore, one must not overlook the fact that before the applicant was
admitted ta Canada a long investigation of
him had already been made.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I am rising not ta object ta or agree with
the bill, for the bill is all right, but ta draw
attention ta the fact that in a number of
places-for instance, in Winnipeg, Vancouver, Halifax, Montreal, London, Ottawa and
Toronto-leading citizens, especially members
of the bench, attend and take part in the
ceremony of conferring Canadian citizenship.
A few words are addressed ta each person
upon receiving his citizenship papers, and
be is reminded of what it means ta be a
Canadian citizen. I think that practice is ta
be commended and that it should be followed throughout the country, for it seems
ta me that sometimes nat enough significance
is attached ta the conferring of Canadian
citizenship. It is very important ta the
recipient, and has become increasingly sa
since about the year 1920. I would urge
upon the government that everything possible be done ta encourage authorities in the
various centres ta see that the ceremony ta
which I have referred is adopted when certificates are granted by the courts. Such
a ceremony at which I was once present in
Winnipeg greatly impressed me and brought
clearly ta my mind what it means ta be a
citizen of Canada. Two or three of the people
who received citizenship certificates on that
occasion came ta my office afterwards and
said, "Mr. Haig, that was a wonderful event
and a memorable ceremony, and we are
highly proud ta be Canadian citizens." It is
a good thing for newcomers ta be so
impressed, and I do hope the practice will
be encouraged.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I do not wish ta delay
the proceedings, but I should like ta ask one
question which the Leader of the Government can probably answer. If a foreigner
comes ta Canada and lives here for five years,
declares his intention and becomes a citizen
of Canada, does his wife automatically
become a citizen of Canada also?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; his wife would
have ta file a separate application. Under
the old act a wife did automatically become
a citizen, and ber name and the names of the

SENATE
children would appear on the reverse side
of the certificate of citizenship. In those days
it was known as a certificate of naturalization. Today separate applications must be
filed.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: I should like to call to
the attention of the Leader of the Government the fact that under the act the applicant
is obliged to have continuous residence in
Canada during a period of one year before
the application is heard. Sometimes it is
very difficult for certain people to comply
with that requirement-people, for instance,
whose business takes them to the United
States, Great Britain or elsewhere periodically. There is no change in the act on this
point. However, I welcome the simplification
that will result from eliminating the need
for a declaration of intention.
I want to congratulate the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) on his remarks
concerning the importance of citizenship.
As a member of the Council for New Canadians, for a number of years in Montreal, I
was instrumental, with the other members,
in an effort to have the granting of certificates of citizenship surrounded with more
solemnity.
Newcomers really appreciate
very much the title of Canadian, and I think
it is important that the judge granting the
certificate should always make some appropriate remarks. That has been the practice
in Montreal since we recommended its
adoption, and I trust the practice will be
followed elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin)
said it was necessary for an applicant to
reside in Canada for a continuous period of
one year prior to his application. Section
10 (1) (b) states that a certificate may be
granted to a person who:
has resided in Canada for a period of least
one year immediately preceding the date of his
application.

You will note the words "has resided". I
do not take that to mean that the applicant
must actually have remained in Canada for
365 days before the date on which his application is heard. He would have to maintain
his residence here, but I do not think that
would prevent him from going away from
time to time on business.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He would be domiciled
here.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The words are "has
resided"; he must have resided here for one
year.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I presume this bill will be sent to committee,
but first I wish to express a practical point

of view. In my opinion it is possible to issue
certificates of citizenship far too easily. I
am not opposing the bill, but I want to say
that anyone who has studied citizenship and
knows anything about citizenship papers
issued by the United States authorities must
come to the conclusion that difficulties which
the applicant encounters make him more
proud of the certificate than if it were handed
out to him too easily. It is all very well
to talk about the simplicity and ease with
which these certificates are to be handed
out, but from a practical point of view that
will not add to the pride of foreign-born
people in Canadian citizenship.
I can speak freely on this subject, for I
believe that I am the only member of this
house who carries citizenship papers. It
may interest honourable senators to know
that the day I applied for my certificate the
fee was reduced from $5 to $1.

Hon. Mr. Haig: You are a foreigner-you

Hon. Mr. Reid: I applied for my citizenship
in order to facilitate my crossing of the
United States border. I do not know whether
the regulations still exist, but it used to be
if in reply to the question "Where were you
born?" you said you were born in England,
Ireland or Scotland, you were treated as a
British subject and not as a Canadian citizen, regardless of how many years you had
lived here.
A great many people who emigrate to
Canada value very highly their citizenship
in their home land. I recall being in court
on an occasion when a man who had lived
in Canada for forty years applied for citizenship, and admitted that he would never have
made the application had it not been for the
fact that he required citizenship in order to
qualify for the old age pension. The presiding judge admonished him by saying, "Then,
if I had my way, I would not grant citizenship to you now."
I again warn honourable senators and the
government that we should not go too far
in simplifying the procedure of qualifying
for Canadian citizenship. If we do so, I
repeat, it will not add to the pride of those
who gain citizenship in this country, the
finest country in the world today.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
in closing the debate, may I say that I
believe the Old Age Security Act has been
amended whereby a person who has resided

MAY 6, 1954
in Canada for twenty years, without becoming a citizen may qualify for old age security
payments.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know that is the law now.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: There are some of us
who think that should not be so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The instance cited by
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) no doubt occurred before
the act was amended.
I should like also to inform the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that I shall bring his representations to the
attention of the Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration. I may also say that the practice
of having a ceremony at the time of giving out
citizenship certificates is more or less prevalent. I know in the city of Brantford, from
which I come, and which is not one of the
larger centres but perhaps one of the important onesSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -a ceremony takes
place from time to time, and if no one else
is present to impress upon the applicants the

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I understood the bill would
go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is it the wish of the
house that the bill go to committee?
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then I would ask
that the bill be placed on the Order Paper

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
May 5, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Hayden for the second reading
of Bill 7, an Act respecting the criminal law.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, this long and difficult bill has been
the subject of study for some five years, first
by the Criminal Code Revision Commission,
and since then by this and the other house.
I approach discussion of it by expressing
gratitude to the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) for the very
capable review which he gave of the bill as
it came back to us from the House of Commons. I am grateful to him net only for
what I learned from what he said, but also
because his review makes it unnecessary for
me to attempt any comprehensive discussion
of the measure and leaves me free to refer
only to those sections in which I am especially
interested or on which I think comment would
serve some useful purpose.
Will honourable senators permit me a
general comment? In my humble opinion this
bill in its present form is a better statement
of the criminal law of Canada than that which
is contained in the Criminal Code now in
force. Not only is it a better, but it is a
shorter statement, and that is of some virtue.
There are in the code 1,152 sections; in the
bill before us there are 753. In other words,
the bill we are now considering is shorter
than the code by 399 sections. What has been
omitted from the bill is a considerable document in itself; as a matter of fact, it would
make a fair-sized book. Further, the code

has 382 pages, while the bill has 297, or 85
fewer pages. That is a conservative calculation, because from a comparison of the two
documents I am quite sure that there is
more reading to the page in the code than in
the bill; so in reading matter the bill is
shorter than the code by more than 85 pages.
Perhaps I am overstating the value of condensation, but remember that the Criminal
Code is a public document that is supposed
to be understood by the common people of
this country, not by magistrates and lawyers
alone, and that it affects the lives of thousands upon thousands of people. Therefore,
the advantage of a short, simple, concise and
readable statement of the code is almost
inestimable.
Condensation, however, is not the only
accomplishment that one finds in this new
bill. Generally speaking, in my judgment
the rewriting of the measure has resulted,
first, in a clearer statement of most of the
sections, secondly, in the elimination of a
very considerable amount of dead-wood; and
thirdly, in a better arrangement of the
subject-matter, a very important improvement
in an act of parliament which is being used
daily in magistrates' courts, as is the code.
The work that has been done on this
bill, I suggest to honourable seantors, is
another illustration of the part which the
Senate plays in the revision and improvement of legislation. When the bill was
introduced here in the first place it was
regarded by some as an almost perfect
measure; it was backed by some great names
of both bench and bar and by high officials
of the Department of Justice. We were
assured by the Minister, who spoke in this
house on the presentation of the bill, that
it was a very fine piece of legislation-and,
of course, in the main it was, notwithstanding
the fact that we pulled it to pieces and found
opportunities for improvement. We made no
less than one hundred and seventy-nine
changes in the bill before it was sent to the
House of Commons, and under provocation
of the scrutiny which the bill received at our
hands the Department of Justice worked on
it again during the parliamentary recess. At
the present session, the bill was brought
down in the Commons, and that house made
seventy-one amendments to it before sending
it on to us.
I would like to make as forcibly as I can
this general observation: there is simply
no substitute for what takes place in the
discussions of deliberative assemblies in the
preparing and perfecting of legislative
measures-measures to which large numbers
of men must submit.
The criminal law, like the city of Rome,
was net built in a day. It is the result of

MAY 11, 1954
many years of development. It is the product
of time, of experience and of endless discussion, not only in high places but in low
places; on the bench, in magistrates' courts,
in legal circles and in parliament. The sum
total of all this thought has produced the
criminal law of today. In my opinion the
House of Commons improved on the work
that we did, as we improved on the work
of the royal commission and of the departmental officials.
The first of the sections in which I am
specially interested is clause 9, with respect
to appeals from convictions for contempt
of court. Usually, I have found, there is
a tremendous resistance to any proposal to
change from the established order. As a lifelong reformer, I can say that with some feeling. But in this instance-a very refreshing
instance indeed-I have found a rather new
experience. From time immemorial the judge
has exercised absolute authority in the court
over which he presides. Contempt of court
procedure has a much greater purpose than of
merely sustaining the egotism or the vanity
of somebody who sits on a bench. That, really,
is not the idea at all. Contempt of court is
the holding up to ridicule, not necessarily of
the judge personally, but of the administration of justice which is in his hands. Contempt of court is interfering with the processes of the court, so as to impede or to
prevent the granting of justice as between
the crown and an individual on trial or as
between individual and individual. Finally,
it is the disobeying of the court's orders. The
jurisdiction of the judge in matters of contempt of court extends far beyond the confines of the court itself, and the judge may
summon a person to appear before him to
answer for an act to which the judge objects.
In charges of contempt of court the judge
may be the witness against the accused; he
registers his judgment without the intervention of a jury, and he finally imposes the
penalty. It can be seen, therefore, that the
authority of the judge is not only wide but
it is arbitrary; and under criminal law from
time immemorial, both in this country and in
Great Britain, there bas been no appeal from
either the conviction or the penalty which a
judge may impose for contempt of court. As
far as I know there is no limitation, either by
statute or common law, on the severity with
which a judge may deal with the accused in
convictions of this kind.
When this legislation first came before the
Senate, as Bill H-8, I thought fit to suggest
that there should be an appeal in these cases,
and at that time the newspapers published
widely my suggestion. The Senate agreed,
both in committee and in the bouse, that

there should be an appeal against both convictions and penalties in cases of contempt
of court. When I returned to Toronto for the
Christmas vacation, I wondered just what
would be said to me by judges because
of the limitations of authority which I had
suggested, but when I interviewed a number
of the high court judges I was surprised to
find that they were all in favour of my
proposal; indeed, Chief Justice McRuer, of
Ontario, had actually published a pamphlet in
which he advocated this idea, and he sent me
a copy of his brochure. However, I was
assured by the judges that, if we took away
the arbitrary character of these adjudications,
there would be many more convictions for
contempt of court and many more penalties
imposed than there have been in the past.
That frightens me not in the least, for I have
already shown that contempt of court usually
consists in contempt of the rights of some
individual who is subject to the court-an
interference between the court and some person indicted that may make a fair trial impossible, or it may consist in interfering in
litigation so as to prejudice the case of one
litigant and advance the case of another.
That is interference with the course of justice
which should not be allowed. Therefore, I
am not at all worried by the statement that
abolition of the present arbitrary procedure
would result in more convictions and more
penalties than have been imposed in the past.
I need hardly remind honourable senators
that the proposed amendment was praised
in the press from coast to coast; and now the
Commons, too, have expressed their approval, much to my satisfaction. However,
the Commons went farther than we did. In
our effort to be moderate we did not provide
an appeal from a conviction by a judge for
an offence of this kind committed in the
fa-ce of the court-that is, committed while
the court is in session-but we did give an
appeal from the penalty imposed under those
circumstances. The Commons went farther
and gave an appeal from the conviction as
well as the penalty, and whether the offence
is committed in court or out of court. I am
ready to go along with them in that, but
unfortunately they have made the right of
appeal subject to leave of the court of appeal
or a judge thereof. I am opposed to that. In
my judgment, an application for leave to
exercise the right of appeal is unnecessary and serves no useful purpose. The argument for the right of appeal must necessarily
be upon the merits of the case; likewise, the
argument with regard to the conviction itself
or the penalty must necessarily be upon the
merits of the -case. The aggrieved party must
thus present to the court of appeal two

SENATE
arguments when one will suffice. Two procedures, when one will do, but add to the
expense of appeal, and of course involves
delay.
Finally, in my judgment an appeal should
be allowed as of right and not as a matter of
grace or of favour. I hope that when the
committee examines these sections it will
recommend to the house that we accept the
widening of the grounds of appeal as suggested by the Commons, but that we strike
out that provision added by the Commons
making necessary two procedures for one
purpose. We should strike out the requirement for consent to appeal, for it is of no
value and involves the extra expense and
delay of two arguments.
The next section to which I wish to refer
is that with regard to treason. I suppose it
is unreasonable to expect that honourable
senators will now recollect the protest which
I made against section 46 (e) in bill H-8,
when it came before us two sessions ago.
That section then read as follows:

change was that it reduced the penalty from
death to fourteen years' imprisonment. However, I was not at all satisfied that the section should be retained at all. So, I am very
much pleased that the Commons did what
I think we should have done, that is replaced
a badly drafted and objectionable section by
a completely new section. The substituted
section now reads:

46 (1) Every one commits treason who, in
Canada,
(e) conspires with an agent of a state other than
Canada to communicate information or to do an
act that is likely to be prejudicial to the safety or
interests of Canada.

I wish to congratulate both the Minister of
Justice and the House of Commons upon
having put something which is treason into
this treason section, and upon wiping out
the highly objectionable wording to which
I have referred. Obviously the betrayal of
valuable scientific or military information to
a foreign state which the betrayer knows or
ought to know will be used to the disadvantage of Canada, is treason of the most
despicable kind, and should be clearly prohibited and punished.
There are three sections to which I should
like to refer, and which the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) in his
excellent speech of last Wednesday mentioned as a group, because each has a labour

Observe, honourable senators, the paragraph does not say "communicate information prejudicial to the safety or interests of
Canada", although that could be read into it:
it applies to all information. What are the
interests of Canada? Are they the interests
of some class in Canada? If so, such a section would indeed be pernicious. Were we
making it treason to tread upon the toes of
the corporate or financial interests of Bay
street or St. James street? Evidently the
Senate agreed in part at least with my
denunciation of this section, because we
struck out the words "interests of Canada".
And then perhaps honourable senators will
recollect that I protested against making it
an offence to communicate information to
the agents of a foreign state. There are
literally thousands of people who might be
described as agents of a state other than
Canada: indeed, all the civil servants of
another state are the agents of that state, as
are members of the armed forces, and there
are many others. To ban the giving of all
information to so large a body of people is
an unwarranted limitation of freedom of
speech and the press in Canada. I argued
further that the prohibition of giving
information of that kind was not in keeping
with the historic idea of treason; and I succeeded, if you will remember, in having that
section transferred from the treason provisions and placed under the heading "prohibited acts". One of the results of that

connotation.

I refer to sections 52, 365 and

372. I may say that these sections, from my
personal experience, have been regarded in
union circles from coast to coast as antiunion; and so widespread has been the objection taken to them by large numbers of
people that the Commons saw fit to save
from their
labour harmless
organized
application. To the Minister of Justice I
give credit for his efforts to make this particular criminal law acceptable to the labour
unions of Canada.
But observe this: these sections although
made inapplicable to the activities of unions,
still apply to the rest of us, and I submit
that legislation sufficiently vicious that it
must be made to by-pass the organized and
the powerful, and left to apply to the unorganized and the uninfluential, should be
eliminated entirely. I do not like making fish
of one and flesh of another, and there is that

MAY

element in the amendments which now come
to us with regard to these three sections. Now,
let me take them one by one and in the
numerical order that I have mentioned. I
commence with section 52. First I will read
it as we passed it in Bill O.
52. (1) Every one who does a prohibited act for
a purpose prejudicial to
(a) the safety or interests of Canada, or
(b) the safety or security of the naval, army
or air forces of any state other than Canada that
are lawfully present in Canada, is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
ten years.

Now, as I said, I took objection to that
phrase "the interests of Canada" because it
might mean the interests of some class in
Canada, and I see that the Commons have
struck out the phrase in this section as they
did in another, and they have substituted
"(a) the safety, security or defence of Canada".
That is a very great improvement. I congratulate the Commons and the Minister
upon doing what I think we should have done
when the bill was before us.
I will now read the section as it appears in
section 52 of Bill 7, the bill that is before us:
52. (1) Every one who does a prohibited act
for a purpose prejudicial to
(a) the safety, security or defence of Canada, or
(b) the safety or security of the naval, army or
air forces of any state other than Canada that are
lawfully present in Canada, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten
years.

I submit that the section, so far as I have
read, is much less objectionable than it was
in Bill O, if it is objectionable at all. But, let
me go on. I will read subsection 2 of section
52 of Bill 7:

11,

1954

prejudicial to Canada or our armed forces
without coupling that type of loyalty to
private property rights? I confess, honourable senators, that I am much more concerned with human rights than I am with
property rights. Property rights are, after
all, the rights of humans with regard to
property, and I object to hitching property
rights, and all that goes with such rights, to
the loyalty of those who would not for the
world interfere with the safety of our armed
forces.
And then, as though section 52 were not
enough to support the sacred rights of property, there now appears in Bill 7 a section
entitled "Mischief", which is number 372.
Let me read it as it appeared in Bill O, which
we revised.
This is under the title of
"Mischief":
372. (1) Every one commits mischief who wilfully
(a) destroys or damages property,
(b) renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective,
(c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the
lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property, or
(d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any
person in the lawful use, enjoyment or operation
of property.
(2) Every one who commits mischief that causes
actual danger to life Is guilty of an Indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.
(3) Every one who commits mischief in relation
to public property is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.
(4) Every one who commits mischief in relation
to private property is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for five
years.

to penalizing any person who endangers
human life. I might not make the· punishment quite so severe as life imprisonment,

voted for my amendment. Honourable senators may smile when I recall my quip at the
time in this house that I stood in what I
called "splendid isolation", but I added these
words: "You will hear about this clause in
the future, or I am no prophet". Honourable
senators, I was a prophet, and a good
prophet, for my words alerted the labour
unions of this country from coast to coast
and liberal-minded people all over Canada,
including members of the House of Commons and the Minister of Justice; and the
result is that both these objectionable sections, namely 52 and 372, come back to us
with provisions added which purport to
make them non-applicable to labour unions.
Unfortunately, however, they are left applicable to the rest of us. Let me read the saving
clause. I will read that which appears in
Bill 7 as section 52, subsection (3), and senators will note that almost exactly similar
words have been added to both sections.

SENATE
At the moment I am not prepared to argue
completely the wisdom or unwisdom of this
new suggestion, but, honourable senators,
when I see a major change made in one of
the fundamental rights that we call British
justice, it gives me pause, and I want it
justified beyond all peradventure before I
consent to it.
I suppose this house will send the bill to
the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Am I to understand that,
under the section as it now stands, a man
who has been freed from jail by some judge
could be held, when an appeal is filed, for
seven days or more?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that is right. As
the law now stands, a man ordered by a
judge to be freed is released right then and
there, and that is the end of it. If anybody
feels that some relative or friend has been
improperly imprisoned, and he can find a
judge who will make an order of habeas
corpus, the prisoner is brought before the
judge at once and the jailer is required to
show his authority for detaining the prisoner.
That is the most fundamental provision of
all British law-to maintain and protect the
security of the subject. I hope this bill
will go to the Banking and Commerce committee, and that that committee will refer it
to a smaller committee, or to several small
committees, so that each one of the bill's
provisions may receive the same meticulous
care, inquiry and scrutiny that was given to
Bill H-8 and Bill O when they came before
us in previous sessions.
Thank you.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to make a speech on this bill,
but I do want to appeal to the members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee, to
which this bill will undoubtedly be sent.
Many other important pieces of legislation
have come before this house in the last ten
or fifteen years, but this bill deals with a
very important matter affecting this country,
namely, the criminal law as set out in the
code. This proposed legislation, of course,
is a re-enactment, not only of the old Criminal
Code in Canada, but of the common law in
England
As the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has pointed out,
this bill in one forrm or another has been
before us on two occasions. But the practical problem as I see it, is that when the

present bill is referred to our Banking and
Committee many honourable
Commerce
senators who do not belong to the legal profession will say that it is a matter for the
lawyers to discuss and decide. I want to say
most emphatically that the decisions to be
made are the responsibility of every member
of the committee, and perhaps the responsibility is a little greater for the members who
are not lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Undoubtedly this will be
our last opportunity to discuss the criminal
law, as the bill will be passed at this session
in some form or other. The subject has been
before parliament long enough ta permit us
to decide what conclusions should be reached.
Therefore, if I may speak on behalf of the
Senate, I implore every member of the
Banking and Commerce Committee to attend
its meetings. True, at times the subjectmatter may seem dull to some members. But
law, as an abstract thing, is a little dull, and
perhaps even a little stupid, especially to
people who are not lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Now, now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As both the honourable
senators from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
have pointed out, there is often a difference
of opinion. But it is important to remind
ourselves that we still have trial by jury in
this country. In the province of Manitoba
lawyers are exempt from jury duty, and I
think it is generally so throughout Canada
that juries are composed of laymen. They
are the people who decide the law in the
country.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They decide the facts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, they find the facts.
We are by this bill drafting new legislation
and if, for instance, the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) should take one
side of a question and I should take another,
it will be up to the laymen on the committee
to decide which view in their opinion should
become the law of Canada. Every member
of the committee must share responsibility
for what the committee does.
The Banking and Commerce Committee of
this house has done some fine work. The
outstanding example is its work in respect to
the income tax legislation. It was the Senate
which advocated the setting up of the Income
Tax Appeal Board, and it took the House of
Commons two or three years to recognize
the importance of our committee's investigation and to adopt its recommendations. The
Income Tax Appeal Board has done much to
make the income tax law of Canada readily
enforceable.

SENATE
plant or in a water supply plant is a person
who has a contract with the city for the
supply of water, light or power, so the
language which was used made the section a
meaningless sort of thing for a great many
years.
The first three paragraphs of subsection (1)
of section 365 have been in force since 1877.
They read as follows:
365. (1) Every one who wilfully breaks a contract, knowing or having reasonable cause to
believe that the probable consequences of doing so,
whether alone or in combination with others,
will be
(a) to endanger human life,
(b) to cause serious bodily injury,
(c) to expose valuable property, real or personal, to destruction or serious injury,

I think any person who has any appreciation of the rules and regulations needed in
order that organized society may function
properly and for the greatest good of the
greatest number, would certainly have to
agree that some kind of substantive offence
involving those prohibitions must be part
of the law of our land if we are going to
have an effective weapon for the protection
of the security and the decent living of the
people of the country.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Will the honourable senator allow a question? Take the case of a
man who has no contract with the company,
and is looking after a small power plant
in a small town, with a hospital probably
depending on the plant's operation. If he
walks out and leaves the city and the hospital without light, is there anything in that
section to cover his case?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Of course, my friend is
dealing with a different offence. At the
moment I was only commenting upon section 365, by way of interjection, to show
that it is not something new, that parliament in its consideration of the code is not
creating a new offence.
In paragraphs (d) and (e) of subsection (1)
of section 365 the language is made to be
meaningful instead of having no meaning
at all. When moving the second reading of
the bill I referred to what might be regarded
as the corresponding section in the present
law, but it seems to me that the general
observation that I made is still sound, that
if people are bound by contract to perform
certain services or to do certain things and
they wilfully break that contract, thereby
endangering human life, that is properly an
offence.
There is an exception to section 365 which
covers the case of a union having a contract
with an electric power plant or some other
organization. If the union has exhausted all its
rights under the contract and as required
by law in the matter of bargaining and

negotiation, and a legal strike takes place,
one which is proper under the law, I think
that the situation is tantamount to one where
there is no legal and effective contract; and
if there is no legal and effective contract,
there cannot be a breach of contract. As I
said the other day, even if the Commons
had not put the saving clause in section 365
it would still be a good defence for a man
to say, "My contract is at an end for this
purpose". Therefore I had no objection to
the changes made in section 365.
Now we come to section 372, dealing with
mischief. Let us consider for a moment how
destructive of any meaning the saving clause
is with reference to the offence created under
this section. Subsection (1) says that every
one commits mischief who wilfully destroys
or damages property. Then subsection (2)
says:
Every one who commits mischief that causes
actual danger to life is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

And subsection 5 says:
Every one who wilfully does an act or wilfully
omits to do an act that it is his duty to do is, if
that act or omission is likely to constitute mischief
causing actual danger to life, or to constitute mischief in relation to public property or private
property, guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years.

Now, that is the essence of the offencewilfully. If I wilfully do an act, or wilfully
omit to do something which it is my duty to
do and as a result of which it is likely to
constitute mischief, constitute actual danger
to life or to property, that is the offence.
Then the Commons added a saving clause,
the effect of which is to single out a certain
section of the community, not only the unions
but any employee of a company, and to provide that if an employee has a contract in
good standing and therefore has a duty to
his employer, and if the employee has no
grievance but walks off the job to discuss
labour problems or protection with other
members of his union or to picket at another
plant which is not associated or identified in
any way with his employer, then in those
circumstances his walking off the job is not
an offence under section 372.
Now, how can you argue logically in support of a saving clause when the offence
consists in the wilful doing of something
or the wilful omission to do something which
it is a duty to do? If you take that as
being the essence of the offence, and if the
man walks off the job under the circumstances which I have related and abandons
the operation that he is looking after, and
human life is thereby endangered, how can
you say that he should be excused? I would
say this, that quite apart from the saving
clause, if the employee were able to go into

MAY 11, 1954
court when faced with a charge under section 372 and to say to the court that he
had no intention of doing any damage, that
he did not realize or appreciate that his
going away from work would result in damage, and if the court believed his explanation,
there could be no conviction under section
372. But why should one section of the
community be favoured by being provided
with a defence or a possible defence to a
charge under this section, when such a
defence is not open to anybody else?
I am not speaking against the unions. My
honourable friend has said that these sections, including No. 372, have a "labour connotation." I say in all seriousness that they
have no more a labour connotation than they
have a connotation in relation to any person
who brings himself within the scope of the
substantive offence by doing something which
is made a substantive offence. As far as I can
gather, the clause is not aimed at labour. It
is true that labour representatives have seen
in it the possibility of application to the
unions, but so may any employed man see
the possibility of its application to him, or so
may any employer. Those who choose to
disregard a clear provision of the law in the
form of a substantive enactment must be prepared to take their chances. Under these circumstances I do not think it is right to create
an offence which involves the intent-the
wilful intent-to destroy property or to
endanger life, where the duty is to do exactly
the opposite, and then to permit the offender
to plead that because it was in furtherance of
his union views and principles to meet with
his brother members, he should be excused
for what otherwise, under section 372 or
section 52, would be an offence. It does not
seem to me sufficient to argue that the act
was done for the purpose of meeting other
union members to discuss matters of mutual
interest, or of going on a picket line to help
a brother in another industry to picket his
employer's plant. It is perfectly proper for
a man to go on a picket line, but if he has a
valid contract or a duty to those for whom he
is working he should give thought to that
duty as being, perhaps, paramount at the
moment, and if he wants to assist in picketing
he can do it after hours or otherwise arrange
his activities for that purpose.
I say in all seriouness, with regard to this
offence of mischief, whether it be called
"mischief" or "wilful damage to property,"
that it is proper, in my opinion, to have in the
criminal law a provision to regulate the
conduct of people in their business and their
day-to-day relations, and to ensure proper
respect for human rights, life, and property,
whether that property be public or private.

I have also something in particular to say
in relation to section 52, which defines sabotage. I think we shall agree that at this time,
possibly more than at any other time, there
is need for very stringent provisions with
regard to sabotage, which means the doing of
acts causing damage to property, and under
certain circumstances endangering life, and
which acts are prejudicial to "the safety,
security or defence of Canada." So far as
section 52 is concerned, one can do such acts
to his heart's content unless it is established
that they are prejudicial to the safety, security or defence of Canada. My honourable
friend, in speaking on this matter, did not
seem sure whether this section should be
linked with-or "hitched" to, I think was the
expression he used-private property rights.
Suppose it may be said that the section does
not achieve that end. What is accomplished
by it is to "hitch" the safety, security or
defence of Canada to those private operations
the damaging of which would be prejudicial
to the safety, security, or defence of Canada.
Let me illustrate. At the Avro plant substantial operations for the defence of Canada
are being carried on, yet the enterprise comes
within the classification of a private as
opposed to a publicly-owned operation of the
people of Canada. Supposing in these circumstances some employees or groups of
employees of the plant walked out, without
notice, at a time when their contract was in
good standing and they, as well as the
employer, had duties and obligations under
it, and as a result of their walk-out and
neglect of duty the safety, security or defence
of Canada was endangered. Would it be in
the interests of Canada to insert a saving
clause which would excuse the defendants if
they could satisfy the court affirmatively that
they left their employment, not with any
intention prejudicial to the safety, security
or defence of Canada, nor with the intention
of damaging property, but solely to join in a
picket line to help out union members in
respect of some entirely different industrial
operation? In my opinion there should be
no qualification of the language which creates
an offence which has as its basis an act
prejudicial to the safety, security or defence
of the country. Every person should be
required to take his chances in relation to
everything he does, and to so govern and
regulate his actions that he shall not create
damage to property or to life which can be
established, by the proof required in a court
of law, to be prejudicial to the safety, security or defence of Canada.
For these reasons, in my view, the saving
clauses in sections 52 and 372 in the form
in which they appear have no place there

SENATE
at all. Whether there should be any qualification or modification of the rigour with
which these offences are treated, I am not at
the moment in a position to say. But in my
opinion, as to sabotage, involving wilful
damage to property and endangering life,
there should be no saving clauses. The offences here dealt with are of such a character
that for those who are brought within the
scope of the section by virtue of having
committed them, no alleviation should be permitted except in respect of the penalty they
may endure for the commission of such
offences.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

DIVORCE STATISTICS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have the very great pleasure this
afternoon of presenting the final report of
the Committee on Divorce.
The Standing Committee on Divorce beg leave
to make their four hundredth report, as follows:
For the present session 462 petitions for bills of
divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt
with by the Standing Committee on Divorce, as
follows:
Petitions heard and recommended ..... 382
Petitions heard and rejected ..........
3
Petitions withdrawn ....................
14
Petitions not proceeded with ...........
63
Total

............................

462

That means, honourable senators, that the
committee actually heard 385 petitions, of
which three were rejected. As to the 63
petitions which were not proceeded with, in
keeping with the usual practice they will go
over to the next session. The total of 462
petitions dealt with is the largest docket in
the history of the Senate.
Of the petitions recommended during the present Session of Parliament, eight were from petitioners domiciled in the province of Newfoundland
and 374 were from petitioners dorniciled in the
province of Quebec.
Of the eight petitioners domiciled in the province
of Newfoundland. three were husbands and five
were wives.
Of the 374 petitioners domiciled in the province
of Quebec, 116 were husbands and 258 were wives.
The committee held 43 meetings.

May I pause here to say how much I
appreciate the excellent attendance of the
members of the Divorce Committee during
this session. It is rather worthy of note that
while we sometimes had four subcommittees
or divisions of the general committee sitting
simultaneously, we never on any one occasion during all these meetings were short of
a quorum. There always were an ample
number of senators present to carry on the
work that came to us. I wish to pay tribute
to the members of the committee for the
sense of responsibility with which they attended to their duties-arduous duties and

On six days the committee functioned in four
sections. On 15 days the committee functioned in
three sections. On 17 days the committee funetioned in two sections. On five days the committee
functioned in one section.

We have changed the organization of the
committee so that it no longer sits in sections,
but as subcommittees. The general committee
meets first in the morning. It does general
work, such as hearing applications for remissions of fees and things of that natureinterlocutory work-and then it resolves itself
into a number of subcommittees. These subcommittees do not make recommendations
which come to the Senate; they report the
facts which they have found, usually stating
that the paragraphs of the petition numbered
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on have been proved,
and, particularly, that the section containing
the accusation of adultery has been either
proven or not proven. That report is taken
up by the general committee; there is the
possibility of debate, if anyone wishes to
say anything about it; and the general committee takes the responsibility, on the report
of the subcommittee, of recommending to
this house the passing of a bill of divorce.
In 21 cases the committee recommended that part
of the parliamentary fees be remitted.

Usually on compassionate grounds.
The fees paid to parliament for bills of divorce
heard and recommended during the session of
1953-54 amounted to $80,220.

A rather considerable sum of money.
Assuming that all bills of divorce recommended
by the committee, now in various stages before
parliament, receive Royal Assent, the comparison
of dissolutions of marriage granted by parliament
in the last ten sessions is as follows:

That the parliamentary fees paid upon the petition of Romuald Fregeau for a bill of divorce

Attached to the motion is a note, "The bill

an explanation. The female respondent did
not appear at the Senate hearing; but I understand that she did appear at the House of
Commons committee and there alleged that
she had not been served with the papers.
However, the papers were complete and regular so far as the Senate was concerned. The
Commons committee calhed the person who
had sworn in an affidavit on our file that he
had served the papers on the respondent,
and hie reaffirmed that sworn statement.
However, there being some doubt, be it ever

the Commons committee properly declined to

position of having to file a new petition at
the next session, when hie can take steps to

feel it is only just that we should refund to
the applicant the fees he has paid, less the
expense the Senate has incurred by way of
printing and translation costs. It is for that
reason I make this motion for a refund of
fees.
The motion was agreed to.

Act of the Province of Ontario with respect to the
expropriation or taking of lands or property apply
mut atis mutandis ta the expropriation or taking
of lands or properties for the works-

in that section of the river.
After this act was passed by the federal
parliament the legishature of Ontario passed
The St. Lawrence Development Act, 1952 (No.
2), which makes specific provisions regarding
expropriation of lands or properties for the
power project in the International Rapids
Section of the St. Lawrence River.
Han. Mr. Reid: What does No. 2 mean?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The rights of those
whose lands have been expropriated, and
the procedure in connection with it, are set
forth at considerable length and in detail
in this provincial act. It provides for any
number of contingencies which might arise
in negotiations between the owners of lands
proposed to be expropriated and the Power
Commission. It also provides for an appeal
in the case of a dispute about the values or
compensation offered for the lands. In regard
to expropriation details, this act replaces the
provisions of the Power Commission Act,
which was the base of our co-operation when
this federal act was passed in 1951.
In order to avoid any dispute or doubt
about the Commission's power to expropriate
lands or properties for the purpose of power
development in the International Rapids Section of the St. Lawrence, it is proposed to
amend section 4 of the International Rapids
Power Development Act by deleting the reference to the Power Commission Act of

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The basis of the International Rapids Power Development Act,
which was enacted in 1951 and proclaimed
on May 20, 1953, is the agreement between
the province and the dominion whereby the
province is given full right and authority
to expropriate or do anything else in connection with the development of the project.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Only as regards power,
not as to transportation or navigation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Oh, no, transportation
is another phase altogether. This relates
only to the power projects proposed between
the State of New York and the Province of
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is this bill to be referred to
committee?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Certainly, if the house
desires it. I think it would be a good thing
to have an official of the Department of
Transport before the committee to elaborate,
to the extent that members of the committee
require, details of the agreement between
the federal authority and the province.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I should think it would be
advisable. There will be certain works
undertaken by the federal government for
navigation purposes; others, by the Government of Ontario and the State of New York
for power purposes. In committee we should
have an opportunity of ascertaining what
has been done to co-ordinate these two
aspects of this great national undertaking.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Copies of the provincial
act should be supplied to us.
Hon. Mr. Vien: We should be told how this
project is to be carried out. Navigation being
a subject within the jurisdiction of the
federal government, with due respect to the
Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission
and to the New York Power Authority, it
would be interesting to study in fuller detail
what arrangements have been made to safeguard the interests of ail concerned.

Canadian Pacific Railway. Those who sat
here in 1904 were concerned with the building of the transcontinental railroad-by whatever name it is called in one or the other
part of the country. Other men sat in this
house in 1914, when war was declared between Canada and Germany; and many of
us older members-older in years as well
as in membership-were present here on
September 9, 1939, when Canada declared war
against Germany the second time. All these
were epoch-marking events; and I rank
with them what we have done and are doing
with regard to the St. Lawrence seaway. As
far as electric power development is concerned this is the final bill, and the ultimate
result will be the spending by the Province
of Ontario and the State of New York, for
electrical development of the great St.
Lawrence river, some $600 million. I noticed
that our American friends have just passed
a bill authorizing their participation, and
the amount of the vote, $105 million, represents their estimate of half the cost of the
seaway alone.
Ever since the subject was first mentioned
I have strongly favoured the development
of electric power on the St. Lawrence River.
I have been no less earnest in supporting the
development of the St. Lawrence seaway.
I admit that subsidiary questions are involved, especially in respect to the waterways
-questions of tolls, matters with regard to
management. All these will be dealt with
during our discussions with the United States
authorities, when they are ready for the
joint agreement on the construction of the
work. I am delighted with the progress that
has been made.
As far as I know there is no opposition to
this legislation. Certainly there is none in
my province, and I believe very little exists
in any of the group of four western provinces
with which I have the honour to be associated. I doubt, too, whether any marked
opposition can be found in any part of the
country. I am reminded quite forcibly that

The first time I ever saw electric light was
in 1897, at Winnipeg. I thought it was wonderful. I used to stay in a rooming-house,
and I can recall my landlady saying to me:
"Mr. Haig, you were the last one in last night
and you did not turn out the light in the
hall. I woke up at 2 o'clock and the light
was still on. I want you to remember that
it costs me a lot of money to keep that light
burning, so after this see to it you turn it
off when you are the last one in." I have
seen the day when it has meant little saving
to turn off a light in Winnipeg.
The development of hydro-electric power
for domestie use in Canada has been tremendous, and it has proven a blessing to Canadian housewives. A few years ago a lady
from a rural part of Manitoba stayed at our
house while attending a church convention

and washing
electric stove, frigidaire
machine, thinking that the lady was unfamiliar with these appliances; but we were
very surprised when she told us that she had
the same electrical equipment in her own
home.
Hydro-electric development has been widespread in the rural sections of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia
in the last few years, and of course the rural
parts of Eastern Canada have enjoyed hydroelectric benefits for some years now.
Honourable senators, the legislation before
us guarantees a tremendous amount of new
electrical energy for the province of Ontario,
and in my judgment there is no limitation to
the use to which this power can be put. The
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson), in her maiden speech in
the Senate, referred to the great lack of
hydro-electric power in New Brunswick.
Fortunately Manitoba is better off. However,
hydro-electric power development on the
Winnipeg River has just about reached its
limit, with the last power site on the river
now under development. Unless there is
further development in the meantime, Manitoba could well be short of electric power by
1960. But there is a potential hydro-electric
development of 8 million horsepower on the
Nelson River, about 400 miles from Winnipeg.
One of the largest developments in Canada,
it bas a guaranteed water supply. Waters
from the prairie rivers and even from part
of Ontario empty into Lake Winnipeg, which
in turn feeds the Nelson River. Manitoba is
assured of hydro-electric power from this
source, and I have no doubt that my children
will see the full development of the power
site on the Nelson River. I remember an
engineer saying some twenty years ago that
if it had not been for a certain Swedish

inventor discovering how to transport electrie
energy 200 miles without the loss of any
more power than is lost in transporting
energy twenty miles, there would be no
electric power in Winnipeg. He said he hoped
to see the day when electric power could
be carried 400 miles without any further loss
of energy.
I am sure everyone in Western Canada is
delighted to see such vast development taking
place on the St. Lawrence River. I do not
believe the construction of the St. Lawrence
deep waterways would be possible without
the simultaneous development of electric
power. It has been estimated by some
American authorities that the development
of hydro-electric power on the St. Lawrence
River will cost in the neighbourhood of $600
million, as against approximately $200 million
for the construction of the seaway itself.
I never understood why the American
people kicked this project around for fifty
years, apparently unable to foresee the
enormous value it would have for their
country. The St. Lawrence seaway will
enable ocean-going vessels to dock at Fort
William in Canada and Duluth in the United
States, and, provided the tolls are reasonable, it will assist greatly in the handling of
our grain. The seaway tolls should not be
made so high that the owners of ocean-going
vessels will find it too costly for their ships
to make the 1,500 mile journey to ports on
the Great Lakes.
I am glad to be a member of the Senate
on the eve of this momentous undertaking by
Canada and the United States, and I only
hope that this huge project will get under
way within the next two years. Should our
foreign markets diminish and unemployment
mount in this country, construction of the
seaway could take up some of the resulting
slack. I am not one who believes that when
a country has unemployment it should
develop some unnecessary project to provide
employment, but the St. Lawrence seaway
is vitally needed. I do not think Canada will
find it difficult to meet her share of the cost.
For one thing, in my opinion there are no
bonds as valuable as hydro-electric bonds,
for they have the double guarantee of the
province or the dominion, whichever it may
be, and -of the industry itself. No matter
what Canada's production has been, hydroelectric development has never been able to
keep pace. I can remember when Sir William Mackenzie, president of the Canadian
Northern Railway, sent his engineer to find
a power site on the Winnipeg River. When
the engineer reported back that he had
located a site which could develop 25,000
horsepower, Sir William said to him: "Young
man, are you not a graduate in electrical

MAY 12, 1954
engineering from McGill University?
Go
back and find a smaller power site. I will
not spend the money needed for that kind
of a development". The young engineer,
after making another search, reported that
this was the only available site. Well, I have
lived to see that particular hydro-electric
development generate 250,000 horsepower.
The development of hydro-electric power can
never be curtailed, and for al these reasons
I strongly support this bill.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I favour the suggestion that the bill be
referred to committee. I think it would be
a wise move.
There appears, however, to be a misunderstanding as to the purpose of this legislation.
I thought that the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) explained quite
clearly that the bill relates to the development of electric power. It has nothing to
do with the building of the canal for navigation purposes; that is an entirely different
matter and is not under consideration at the
present time.
When the government of
Canada and the governrment of the United
States finally enter into an agreement for the
building of the canal, I presume that legislation in some form will be introduced in
parliament for ratification. In any event,
such legislation is not before us at the
present time, nor is that question before us
now. The only question before us is in connection with the giving of certain rights of
expropriation of property under the St.
Lawrence Development Act 1952 (No. 2) of
the Province of Ontario, at present provided
for under the provisions of the Power Commission Act of Ontario. These powers were
given previously under an act which was
passed by the parliament of Canada, known
as an Act respecting construction of works
for the generation of electrical power in the
International Rapids Section of the St.
Lawrence River. The act was cited as the
International Rapids Power Development
Act, Chap. 157, R.S.C. 1952. To make that
change is the sole purpose of the bill
before us.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has referred to the great benefits that
will come to the province of Ontario from
the development of the St. Lawrence seaway. I am not going to discuss the question
of navigation. The bill before us, as I have
said, deals with the development of electrical
energy. If the province of Ontario benefits
from the development, Canada as a whole
will also benefit, for a development in any
part of Canada is an advantage to all of
Canada. Mining developments are taking
place at the present time in eastern Canada
-I
am thinking of New Brunswick, of

471

Labrador, and also northern Quebec-and
oil developments are taking place in northern
Manitoba, in Saskatchewan and Alberta; and
in the great province of British Columbia
water power and mining are fast developing.
As I say, a development in any province is
of advantage to all of Canada, so if electrical
energy is developed along the St. Lawrence,
I am satisfied that Canada as a whole 'will
benefit from it.
Honourable senators, I agree with the
Leader of the Opposition that this bill should
pass, but I felt that I should point out, as
the honourable senator frorn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) did, that this bill deals not
with navigation along the St. Lawrence, but
merely with the development of power.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
in view of the statement made by the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), and enlarged upon by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), perhaps I may
be permitted to make a few observations in
answer to the suggestion that we of the
Maritimes are generous and allow this kind
of legislation to pass without very much
objection. I am not one of those who think
that this bill will be particularly objectionable to the Maritime provinces. Usually, the
Martimes do not get the economic benefit
from legislation that other provinces do; our
interests, in many aspects, differ from those
of other provinces. However, I think this
proposed legislation affords an opportunity
to the Maritime provinces if the matter is
pursued in the right way. In the past, Nova
Scotia has been successful because of her
activities upon the sea. Owing to prevailing
prices, her present economy is not good, her
basic industries such as mining and apple
growing are not thriving. It occurs to me that
to be successful we will have to revive and
stimulate our activities on the seas. The St.
Lawrence seaway development should open
up new opportunities, especially to the
coasting trade.
A few months ago President Eisenhower
of the United States declared that the coasting
trade and marine activities on the Great
Lakes should be confined to the United States
and Canada. If that cornes about, I see an
opportunity for the Maritime provinces. Concurrently with the Statute of Westminster
there was passed the Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement, by which the
marine trade of Canada was continued with
and extended to Great Britain, the Commonwealth, and, practically speaking, left the
door open for other European countries as
well.
Reciprocity with the United States on
coastal trade would provide us with a coastal
area from the Gulf of Mexico to the head

SENATE
of the Great Lakes, and we would be associated with a country which has the highest
standards in the world. Without such reciprocity, I do not see how commerce on the
Great Lakes can be carried on after the
waterways development takes place.
We are told that the men of our merchant
marine are paid so much that we ýcannot
succeed in marine activities. Well, an ordinary seaman gets $1 an hour in my province,
including his maintenance. Where in Canada
does skilled labour work for less than $1
an hour? Further, it must be remembered
that a seaman is required to work eight hours
a day and is always on call on his ship in an
emergency.
We are part of a protected country with
high standards of living; we pay duty on
automobiles, textiles, furniture and many
other items. But with shipping a natural
activity for the Maritimes, we must face
open competition with the low-standard ýcountries of Europe. We are for freedom of trade,
if it is beneficial; but under present world
conditions, free trade is futile and we must
ask for our share of the protection in our
own country. The coasting trade should be
for Canadians in Canadian-built ships. The
United States offers high protection to its
shipping trade; and Australia also, since becoming a party to the Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement, has passed strict
regulations. The coasting trade of Canada
is the cradle of our merchant seagoing trade.
Surely we must protect the cradle. I may add
that the United States bonuses its marine
trade, but I shall leave discussion on that
point for another occasion when I intend to
speak further on this important subject. However, I did not want to let this opportunity
pass without commenting on what was
implied by other speakers.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
the discussion on this rather simple bill has
been most interesting, but it occurs to me that
we are perhaps wandering a little from the
subject-matter.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I think perhaps we are.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I rise to attempt to

oring the discussion back to the details of the
bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am glad to hear the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) say that he intends to move
that the bill be referred to committee, because
I think it contains a rather peculiar provision which bas not, to my mind, been satisfactorily explained.

What we are being asked to do by this
bill is to confirm certain rights of expropriation which the province of Ontario has given
to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario in respect of the development in the
International Rapids. I am wondering why
it is necessary for us, the federal parliament,
to confirm a power of expropriation given by
the province of Ontario to one of its own
creatures. There may be a perfectly good
and logical explanation for it, but I should
like to learn in committee why such a confirmation appears to be necessary.
I have one further observation by way of a
small complaint. Under this bill we are asked
to incorporate in the statute, powers of expropriation in the taking of lands, which powers
are included in an act passed by the province of Ontario. That is a fairly serious step.
After all, if we take away a man's property
by expropriation, we are interfering with
his rights. It may be perfectly proper to do
so, but I think it would have been the part
of wisdom when the bill was being drafted
to have the explanatory notes state what
powers of expropriation we are asked to
approve.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Otherwise, unless we
examine the Ontario act we cannot know
what powers of expropriation we are being
asked to approve. For that reason I think it
is essential that this bill go to committee,
where we can satisfy ourselves on this point.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
I should like to have the privilege of saying
a few words in conclusion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the honourable senator who moved
the second reading of the bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert) speaks now, he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I
shall not detain the house long. I appreciate
the discussion that has taken place and the
points that have been raised.
To refer specifically to the purpose of the
bill, which I think may be described as a
technical purpose, I feel that the point just
raised by the senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) is one which he certainly is
more competent to analyze than I. However,
as he was speaking, the thought came to my
mind that the legislation which is described
as the International Rapids Power Development Act, 1951, and appears as Chapter 157 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, takes
into account the jurisdictional distinction
between the federal authority and the province of Ontario; and that the federal jurisdiction would not be considered at all in connection with this legislation if it were not for

engineer, I do not know if that is likely or
possible or impossible. We have put ourselves in a position where it is no longer
necessary that our consent be obtained. We
have given the province our powers. Now,
is there any limitation on how far the province may go in the exercise of our rights in
the expropriation of lands required for the
development of the power resources in the
International Rapids Section of the St.
Lawrence River, lands that may or may not
be required by the federal authority? How
far have we gone?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: My answer to the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) would be this, that the end envisaged in this legislation namely, the establishment of certain power development works
on the International Rapids Section of the St.
Lawrence River in conjunction with the State
of New York, will govern completely the acts
of expropriation that may be taken by the
Province of Ontario. I think that in so far as
expropriation lends itself to that end the
Province of Ontario has been delegated complete authority by the federal authority to
proceed with such measures.
The question of whether or not expropriation might interfere with or have some effect
upon the later development of a seaway is an
engineering question that I am not competent
to answer, but I have discussed the problem
at other times with engineers, who told me
that it is impossible to build a dam with an
embankment on one side of the river and
none at all on the other side. So, if a dam
is to be built in the International Rapids
Section of the St. Lawrence River, for the
purpose of storing water to be used for the
development of power, it must encroach on
the American side of the river, but whether
that would interfere with the seaway project
to be built later on in the form of a series of
canals, I do not know. I do not think it
would. I think, if anything, that the seaway
objectives will be provided for in the engineering plans to be approved and that the
canal system will be developed later consistent entirely with the work that is done on
the power project. But that is pure surmise
on my part, though not without some foundation. On taking the whole purpose of this
bill into consideration, I do not think that
any limitation can be put on the powers that
have been delegated to the Province of

Ontario by the dominion in connection with
the steps that have to be taken to bring about
the establishment of the power project.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: One more question:
would it be possible for the sponsor of the
bill to supply, at least to those who are
especially interested, copies of the Ontario
legislation?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I suppose the bill will
be referred to committee. We ought to have
the material there.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We ought to have it
before the committee meets.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I will endeavour to
have copies available. I would suggest also
that the statute known as an Act respecting
Construction of Works for the Generation of
Electric Power in the International Rapids
Section of the St. Lawrence River, which
contains the agreement between the dominion
and the Province of Ontario, should be
perused by those who are interested in this
question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is in our unrevised
statutes.
The bill was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The bill has nothing to
do with transportation; it has to do with
electric power. Surely that is a matter
for the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: But it is a Transport
Department bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not a transport bill
at all. As the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said,
it has nothing to do with transportation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It presents a legal question,
and the Banking and Commerce Committee,
which used to be known as the Law Amendments Committee, and is so termed in most
legislatures, is our legal committee.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: My honourable friend
will recognize, of course, that the Department
of Transport has charge of the whole water
powers branch, and for that reason it has
been responsible for all the negotiations
which have taken place in connection with

MAY 12, 1954
the development of the St. Lawrence waterways. That is the only reason I moved reference of the bill to the Committee on
Transport and Communications, but if the
Senate decides that it should be referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, that will
be all right with me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The chairman of the
Committee on Transportation and Communications is the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who is an eminent
lawyer. I do not think a more suitable committee could be chosen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The point I have in mind
is that the bill should be referred to the
committee which can best deal with it. As
I have said, the Banlçing and Commerce
Committee deals with all legal questions. If
this bill is strictly a transport bill it should
be considered by the Transport and Communications Committee; but the connection
of the Minister of Transport with the bill
arises from the fact that the St. Lawrence
waterways is under his jurisdiction and he
is concerned only with the transport sections
of the bill. The honourable senators from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) have
raised purely legal questions. As I am on
both the Transport and Communications and
the Banking and Commerce Committees, I
personally am indifferent, but I still hold
that this bill should be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not familiar
with the work of the Senate committees, but,
glancing over the names of the members of
the Transport and Communications Committee, it appears to me that the membership
includes as many lawyers as are on the
Banking and Commerce Committee. There
are other matters which probably will be
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, and I believe it would facilitate the
work of the house if the Transport and Communications Committee considered this bill.
As the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has said, no doubt that committee in time will receive the bill with
respect to the development of the St.
Lawrence River for transportation purposes.
There is some relation between these two
projects. Further, in connection with the

bill now before the house, I would think that
the con-mmittee might like to hear from the
Minister of Transport.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, he can come.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It occurs to me, as
no doubt it must have occurred to the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) when he made the proposal, that
there is some relationship between the
development of the St. Lawrence for transport purposes and this hydro-electric development. In any event, whether or not he
had that point in mind, it is one reason why
I support the idea of sending this bill to the
Transport and Communications Committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am rather inclined to
support the suggestion that it be sent to
the Transport and Communications Committee, for the reason that the chairman of that
committee, the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) is in attendance here, and is familiar with the problems
which have been raised in this debate, while
the chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee is not with us. The honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
I are on both these committees.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Personally, I am not a bit
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And the last point made
by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) is an important one,-that the
minister most familiar with the subject is
the Minister of Transport, Hon. Mr.
Chevrier, who may be present with us.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert was
agreed to and the bill was referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
DIVORCE PETITIONS

On the notice of motion by Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
Resolved, that it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament approve the ratification by Canada of
the Agreement on Commerce between Canada and
Japan, signed at Ottawa on March 31, 1954, and
that this House do approve the same.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to make a reference to

proceed with the motion this afternoon. I
have asked the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) if he will
present this motion to the house, and he
has kindly consented to do so on Tuesday
next.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if later in the session the text of
the agreement will be placed before us for
examination?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The agreement
appears as an appendix to the Senate Hansard of April 1.
CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL
THIRD READING

On the order for the third reading of
Bill C-15, an Act to amend the Canadian
Citizenship Act:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, when this bill was before the house
for second reading the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) asked me
how long an immigrant who had married a
Canadian citizen was required to remain in
Canada before becoming a citizen of this
country. At that time I stated that I did not
believe any definite length of time was

set out. I said, however, I would make
inquiry, and if I were wrong I would let the
house know. I find that my statement was
incorrect, and that under those circumstances
an immigrant must remain in the country for
a period of one year before becoming a
citizen.
I also said that under special circumstances
an applicant for citizenship did not have to
comply with the requirement of filing in
advance a declaration of intention to become
a citizen, if this requirement was waived by
the minister. Here are the words I used:
. . . at the present time a declaration of intention
. . . must remain on the office files until a year has
expired; so that an applicant, unless under very
urgent and special circumstances, cannot become
a Canadian citizen before that time has elapsed.

I find that no urgent or special circumstances are taken into consideration, and that
at the present time an applicant must file a
declaration of intention.
Honourable senators, I move the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT
REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the first report of the Joint Committee on
the Library of Parliament.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved concurrence in the report.

He said: Honourable senators. in moving
concurrence in this report I think some
explanation as to the recommendations it
contains would be of interest.

stage of transition makes it necessary, I think,
for us to appreciate what is contemplated.
The first recommendation in the report
of the Joint Committee on the Library of
Parliament is that consideration be given to

the appointment of up to eight additional
temporary employees to the staff of the
library. That recommendation was made
with a view to taking full advantage of the
period of renovation so as to have the books
and files of the library duly reclassifled and
catalogued by the time the premises have
been made ready for reoccupation.

Hon. Mr. Euler: When will that be?

have in the past. I am sure that anyone who
has had anything to do with the library must
have appreciated many times over the very
co-operative service given by the staff, sometimes under difficulties as to limitations of
space and numbers for which those in charge
of the library have not always been responsible. To improve the efficiency all around, in
personnel and in service, is the objective of
the heads of the library, as well as of the
joint committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who are the five named to
the subcommitee?
Hon. Mr. Lamber±: I know that the Secretary of State is one of them. To represent
the Senate my name has been suggested as a
member of that subcommittee. I have not all
the names, but I can secure them very
readily.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In adopting the report do
we not approve the composition of that committee?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: We approve the recommendation to appoint a subcommittee of
five members. The joint committee recommended that the joint chairmen-the Speakers
of the Senate and of the House of Commonsshould name the subcommittee. I am sorry
that I cannot now recall the names of three
of the members.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To what point have the
plans for the National Library been carried?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The plans for the
National Library have been approved. Also
the site of the library has been chosen; it is
on the bank of the Ottawa River, near the
present Justice Building. The work of the
National Library Committee, of which Mr. K.
Lamb, the Dominion Archivist and the Chief
National Librarian, is the head, has been
proceeding now for two years. It is mainly
zoncerned with the cataloguing of all Canadiana that can be found.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has construction been
started?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Not yet.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask if the officials
of the library will be considered as in the
first and second classes, so they may use the
elevators, or will they have to use the back
door?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I could not answer that.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am always unwilling to vote for a report
requiring approval of a committee whose
names I do not know. This committee is
being given very important powers, and
before we vote on the report I think we
should know who the members are. It is a

fundamental principle of democracy that
final decisions in these matters should be
made by the people's representatives. I do
not think this house gave the Joint Committee power to make these nominations without our approval. I have no objection to
the subcommittee being named by the honourable the Speakers of both houses, but that
having been done the names should appear
in the report which we are asked to approve.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have no reason to
withhold any names, except that I do not
have them. The chairmen were authorized
by the Joint Committtee, which consists of
thirty to thirty-five members, to name a
subcommittee. I am quite satisfied that a
similar procedure is followed in many other
cases. I believe that the members of the
subcommittee have already been appointed
by the respective Speakers; and if that is
the case any report concerning the personnel
should be submitted, not by me, but by the
chairmen. All I am doing is to move concurrence in the report which was placed on
the table by His Honour the Speaker as a
joint chairman, and I am sure that he, in
that capacity and as a member of the committee, would be glad to place on record the
names of the subcommittee, if they have
already been selected.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There may be a very
simple solution. If, as the senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has said, the
Speakers of both houses have made the
the
perhaps His Honour

Speaker would inform us who the members
are.

have no knowledge of the nomination which
was made by the honourable the Speaker of
the other place. In any event, it would seem
to me that whatever recommendations the
subcommittee make can have no effect unless
they are sanctioned by the full committee,
whose names are generally known. It should
not be difficult to give a specific answer, if
not now, at the next sitting, to the question
of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. Haig: The reason I raised the
question is that I am convinced it is a bad
principle for this house to "vote blind" in
matters of this kind. Much the same situation arose in connection with the revision of
the Criminal Code. A special subcommittee
was appointed and, when it was ready to
report, a question arose whether the report
should be presented to the house direct by

MAY 13, 1954
the subcommittee, or through the main committee, and it was agreed that the report
should be presented to the main committee
and by that committee transmitted to this
house. I believe the same principle should
be followed in this case. I am not questioning the nomination of the honourable the
Speaker, and I am delighted with the selection he has made, but surely, if a body is
to be named to control the library we have
the right to know what persons are selected.
I have confidence in His Honour the Speaker
-no one has more confidence in him than I
-and
in the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), but I contend
that the procedure is completely wrong, and
I want to protest as strongly as I can. I
want to know whom I am voting for.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: At the joint meeting,
I believe that apart from the Honourable the
Speaker, the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) and I were the only two
representatives of the Senate who were
present. So we did not take advantage of
our opportunities to express our opinions.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I point out that
the fourth paragraph of this report reads,
"That a subcommittee of five be appointed
by the Speakers . . .".

That is what the

Senate is asked to approve. It is not asked
today to approve the appointees, but merely
to approve of what the committee has done
to date. One of the things it did was to
ask the Speakers of both houses to appoint
a subcommittee of five. They may or may
not have appointed that subcommittee. If
we think it is proper that they shall make
these appointments there can be no objection
to this motion for concurrence.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Might I also add that,
apart from the point of personnel, the results
of the advice which may be given to the
Parliamentary Librarian by that advisory
subcommittee must be reported to this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Oh, yes. The advice
given to the Parliamentary Librarian will not
be mandatory, but purely advisory. It is
of a general nature concerning the kind of
service that might be rendered by the Library
of Parliament to members of parliament. It
concerns the class of record that should be
kept in the library. In addition to complete
Hansard records there are many books of
reference, constitutional and otherwise, which
should be kept. However, a limit has to
be placed somewhere, for in the past the
Library of Parliament has simply been inundated with all kinds of literature ranging
from detective stories to the classics. An attempt will be made to cull all the material

that has been kept in the library so that it
will become distinctly
a Library of
Parliament.
The appointment of a subcommittee has
been recommended to deal purely with these
subjects, and to advise the Parliamentary
Librarian on what matters he should look into
when visiting legislative libraries in London
and in Washington. The findings of the
Parliamentary Librarian will be subject to
consideration by the Joint Committee on the
Library of Parliament and also by parliament
itself. There is no prejudice in this.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I do not rise to question the merits of
this report. There is no doubt that our
Library of Parliament is a most useful aid
to members of parliarment. Last year one
of my colleagues inquired whether the library
would be taking on additional staff to help
expedite research work on matters with which
members of parliament have to deal. In
general, members of both houses have no
knowledge of the provisions contained in
bills until they are presented in one house
or another, but very often authoritative
works from British, French, United States
and other sources on the subject matters dealt
with in the bills may be found in the library.
Nobody can expect members of parliament,
with their heavy and onerous legislative
duties, to make too detailed a study in the
Library of Parliament of information and
records that are available there.
The Joint Committee has seen fit to recommend that consideration be given to the
appointment of temporary additional qualified
staff to speed up the work of recataloguing
the collection of the library. That is all very
well, but I doubt very much whether these
employees will be dismissed after their
temporary employment has been completed.
I think it would be wise to appoint these
qualified employees on the basis that their
services be retained, after the recataloguing
of the library collection has been completed,
to assist in expediting library research work
for members of parliament. At Washington
the members of Congress merely call up the
Library of Congress, submitting certain
questions on which they require information,
and within a very few days they receive a
detailed report. It would be extremely useful if a similar service could be rendered by
our library.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it may seem somewhat untoward for me to
discuss this report now, for I happen to be
a member of the Joint Committee on the
Library of Parliament. Unfortunately I was
unable to attend the last meeting of this
committee-the only one that I missed-but

Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission
May I say that the honourable gentleman
who moved concurrence in this report (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) need not take criticism of the
report personally, for he moved its concurrence in the Senate on behalf of all
members of the committee.
I feel that a reclassification of the staff of
the library by the Civil Service Commission
Experienced high-class
would be wise.
officials in our library, many of whom hold
university degrees, receive less remuneration
than do many less highly qualified employees
around these parliament buildings. I have
always felt that such a situation should be
remedied, and I am therefore pleased to see
this recommendation contained in the report.
A momentous step was taken by the Government of Canada when it decided to build
a National Library. The Library of Parliament is very much overcrowded by reason
of having to care for a vast stock of old, rare
and valuable books and papers, which should
be housed in some safer place. The National
Library, when built, will relieve the Library
of Parliament of that responsibility, and the
removal of excess material from the Library
of Parliament will enable it to give much
more useful service to members of parliament.
While it may be deemed wise to send our
Parliamentary Librarian to London and
Washington to study the services given by the
legislative libraries in those centres, I think
this matter is important enough to warrant
sending an experienced parliamentarian to
accompany him. I am not questioning the
capability of our Parliamentary Librarian at
all, but I believe that a parliamentarian who
has had long experience in seeking for
information from our library would be
specially well qualified to inquire into how
this research work could be speeded up. I
doubt whether any single librarian would be
in a position to cover all the matters involved
in the organization of a legislative library.
Had I been able to attend the last meeting
of the Joint Committee I would have made
the same suggestion there.
What is going to happen to the proposed
additional staff when the renovation of the
Library of Parliament has been completed,
and the respective duties of the new National
Library and the Library of Parliament have

been laid down? I doubt whether there will
be any interchange of staff between these
libraries, and I have been around parliament
long enough to know what "temporary
employment" in the government service
means. Let us face it: as far as the government is concerned temporary employment
means permanent employment. In my opinion the additional employees will not be
retained only during the work of recataloguing, but will most likely be on the staff
for as long as they desire. I am somewhat
critical of the taking on of these additional
employees, and I also do not think that it is
a good idea that the Parliamentary Librarian
should go alone to London and Washington.
The question of room space on parliament
hill has often been discussed, and I am just
wondering where these extra eight library
employees will find accommodation. I am
pleased to know that some temporary space
was found in the new Supreme Court building for part of the present library staff. I
was going to suggest that perhaps they could
use the beautiful bathrooms in that building,
for all the use that has so far been made
of them. I think that the visit of the Parliamentary Librarian to London and Washington will afford him valuable experience and
should help him in planning for the reorganization of the library in the renovated
premises.
I rose, however, particularly to say that I
am in favour of higher remuneration for the
men and women on the staff of the Library
of Parliament, who give such splendid
service.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it has been moved by the Honourable
Senator Lambert, and seconded by the Honourable Senator Macdonald, that the first
report of the Joint Committee on the Library
of Parliament be concurred in. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in, on division.

CANADA-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON
COMMERCE
MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF RATIFICATIONDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Elie Beauregard moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament approve the ratification by Canada of the
Agreement on Commerce between Canada and
Japan, signed at Ottawa, March 31, 1954, and that
this house do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, the ratification of the Agreement on Commerce between
Canada and Japan, which the Senate is now
being asked to approve, was signed by the
contracting parties, Canada and Japan, at
Ottawa on March 31, 1954, and a copy of the
agreement was tabled simultaneously in both
houses of parliament on April 1. Honourable members will find a copy of the agreement, including correspondence on the
Agreement and the Agreed Official Minute,
printed as an appendix to the Senate Hansard
of April 1.
In broad terms, our Canadian customs
tariff recognizes three classes of countries
whose products are imported into Canada.
First, there is the privileged class made up
of the members of the commonwealth, which
class is not disturbed at all by this agreement. The second class, comprising what are
called "unconditional most-favoured-nation"
countries, is the class in which fall most
countries with whom Canada has made trade
agreements. The third class is made up of
countries whose exports to Canada are subject to our general tariff regulations. Japan
has been in this third class, but under this
agreement Canada and Japan accord each
most-favoured-nation
other unconditional

treatment in all matters with respect to customs duties, taxes and other regulations
concerning trade.
The agreement provides also that neither
country will impose or maintain restrictions
or prohibitions affecting its trade with other
countries, unless similar measures are applied
equally to all third countries. In the allocation of foreign exchange and in the administration of foreign exchange restrictions
affecting trade, each country will accord
treatunconditional most-favoured-nation
ment.
The duration of the agreement is expressed
in article VII, clause 2:
The present agreement shall continue in effect
for a period of one year from its entry into force
and thereafter until three months from the day on
which either contracting party shall have given
notice to the other contracting party of an intention of terminating the agreement.

Honourable senators may ask why this
agreement was entered into. I reply by quoting from a statement made by the Right
Honourable the Minister of Trade and Commerce in the other place, on May 12, 1954, as
reported in the Commons Hansard, at page
4648:
In recent years we have been imposing the high
rates of our general tariff upon imports from Japan.
In consequence, we have imported very little from
there, even though we have been selling large
and increasing amounts of our exports to that
country. It has become more and more difficult
in these circumstances to justify the fact that we
were not extending most-favoured-nation treatment
to Japan. In the new trade agreement we are now
proposing to correct this anomaly.

Honourable senators will find a detailed
account of the trade situation contained in
three tables, which I now ask the consent of
the house to file as an appendix to today's
report of debates, to be considered as part of
my remarks. The first of these three documents, headed "Canada's Trade with Japan",
covers first the years 1928 and 1929, the three
years preceding the Second World War1937, 1938 and 1939-and the more recent
The
years of 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1953.
second table gives in considerable detail
Canada's pre-war trade with Japan. The
third table covers Canada's trade with Japan
in 1953.
See Appendix to today's report of Debates.
The third of these documents shows substantial increase in Canada's export trade
with Japan in recent years. In 1953 our total
exports to Japan were approximately $119
million, while our imports amounted to only
a little more than $13 million. Our main
exports were wheat, $52 million; barley, $17
million; iron ore and scrap iron, $11 million;
woodpulp $8 million, and such other items as

MAY 18, 1954
wheat flour, flaxseed, copper, asbestos, newsprint, aluminum, brass, synthetic resins, hides
and skins. Japan was Canada's third largest
market for wheat last year and one of the
leading markets for barley, woodpulp and iron
ore.
Honourable senators, Japan is by far the
most important nation of the Far East; it is
the third biggest importer of oui products,
and it is friendly ta the western bloc. It has
a population of more than 90 million people.
During the debate on this agreement in the
other house the Riglit Honourable the Minister of Trade and Commerce, speaking. about
the progress Japan bas made since the end
of the Second World War, lad this to say:

I want now to tuin to the agreement itself.
I will flot deal with it in mudli detail, but I
wish to pay more attention to what I shail
caîl the safeguards suirounding the agreement. As I have already mentioned, the
agreement does not affect oui trading relations with the countries of the commonwealth.
These countries remain in the privîleged
class. Another safeguard is that the agreement is made for a period of fifteen months,
at the end of which time both contracting
parties, or one of them, may decide to terminate the agreement, or to enter into
pourparlers in order to come to a new
arrangement. Further safeguards are to be
found in the text of the agreement itself,

exceptional cases. It is the intention of both
parties to employ these safeguards subject to
the most extreme precautions.
As regards eight or nine of our products
which constitute the larger part of our
exports, the following undertaking appears
in another letter from the Ambassador of
Japan to the Secretary of State for External
Affairs:
With reference to the Agreement on Commerce
between Japan and Canada which has been signed
today, I have the honour to state that notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of article
III which permit certain temporary deviations from
the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article,
the Government of Japan undertakes to accord
unconditional non-discriminatory treatment with
respect to the importation into Japan of the nine
commodities listed below, subject to exceptions
agreed upon between the Government of Japan and
the Government of Canada.
Wheat,
barley, woodpulp, flaxseed, primary
copper, lead in pigs, zinc spelter, synthetic resins,
milk powder.

These, in my opinion, are the main safeguards which have been agreed upon, and
I think they are sufficient to dispel any concern we may have as to the practicability
and the utility of the agreement. It is the
expectation of both parties to the agreement
that trade between the two countries will be
increased. The ratios may vary somewhat,
but not, it is expected, to such an extent as
to endanger our respective economies. It may
be, as I have already remarked, that a few
industries will suffer. That possibility bas
been considered, and it is held that the
general good must supersede an individual
interest. It is significant that, according to
the report of the debate in the other place,
the very members who have raised such
objections have themselves answered their
own contentions, for they admit that, nevertheless, the agreement should be approved.
There is another reason why we should
make certain concessions to Japan. Incidentally, these concessions are made in the expectation that they will prove beneficial to
Canada as well as to Japan. At the present
time Japan is the most populous free country
in the Far East, and if the West is not prepared to lend her aid she may well look to
the communist group for assistance. Canada
is spending large sums of money to help countries who are unable to help themselves, and
I am sure we all realize that while this may
bring us certain losses in the matter of trade,
these losses are nothing compared with what
might result if this assistance were not forthcoming. Although this factor may have no
direct connection with the subject of trade
and commerce, I feel that it is perhaps the
most vital reason why we should approve
this agreement.

Some non. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: I think this was
perhaps one of the main reasons why the
agreement was unanimously approved at one
sitting of the House of Commons. I am not
asking that the Senate express its approval
without any discussion; on the contrary, I
hope that some honourable senators will give
the house more information than I have been
able to furnish, and answer any criticism that
may be levelled at the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I move
the adjournment of the debate. May I take
this opportunity to congratulate the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard) on his fine speech of this afternoon. It was the first recent occasion upon
which I have heard him make extended
remarks in this house, and I am sure that
all honourable senators were delighted to
hear him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

the report of the Civil Service Commission
respecting the staff a! the Library af Parliament

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved that the
report be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators will notice
that the report o! the Civil Service Commission reclassifying -certain positions on the
staff of the Library of Parliament was printed
in yesterday's Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate. This report is in response to the
recommendations contained in the report o!
the Joint Committee on the Library that was
presented to the Senate on Thursday last.
I have nothing further to say, except to
remark upon the prompt action o! the Civil
Service Commission in this matter.
The saine report was passed yesterday in
the other house, unanimously, and without
comment.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, before
the motion carnies I want to compliment the
Civil Service Commission upon acting SO
promptly. It is flot often that we have such
prompt action f rom the commission. However, I find some of its recommendations
most intriguing, if not mystifying.
A quick glance at the new classifications
indicates to me that the salary range between Reference Librarian, Grades 1 and 2,
is almost $700, while between Grades 4 and
5 it is only slightly more than $200. On the
other hand, the difference between a Reference Librarian, Grade 5, and the Chie!
Reference Librarian is almost $900. 1 draw
these figures to the attention of honourable
senators so that when we next examine the
affairs of the Library o! Parliament we can
ask the Civil Service Commission why the
salary range is flot uniform from grade to
grade.
The motion was agreed ta, and the report
was concurred in.

myself and address my remarks to Mr.
Speaker. My earlier training accounts for my
forgetting at times the accepted procedure.

SENATE
May I say first that I approve of the trade
agreement now before us. However, I should
like to make some comments about the situation behind the making of an agreement.
For the past year or two our trade position
with Japan has been very much in our
favour. The interesting point about the
agreement is that we have now come to
terms with one of the nations with which
we were at war from 1941 to 1945. I anticipate that within a very short time we shall
have presented to us for consideration a
similar agreement with West Germany, or
Germany proper, for today we seem to be
treating as allies those people who from 1939
to 1945 were our enemies. I can remember
debating in this house, at the time Germany
attacked Russia, the question of which side
we should be on. Some question was raised
then as to whether our action in voting
supplies and ammunition to Russia was not
a mistake. Considering all that has happened
in the meantime, I do not know whether or
not it was a mistake, but I do know this, that
at the time we voted supplies and ammunition to Russia-and I think we were unanimous-we did so because we thought that
was the best thing to do for Canada and for
the world.
I want to take advantage of this opportunity to draw some conclusions from what
we are doing in this case. It seems at the
moment that in making this agreement with
Japan we are doing the very best thing
we can for the world and, incidentally, for
Canada at the same time. Those of us who
can remember life prior to 1914 must realize
-and there is no use in denying this hard
fact-that we are living in an entirely different kind of world now. Not having the
same kind of a world today as we had then,
we cannot make the same kind of calculations
at all. The 1914-1918 war with Germany was
very much like the old wars that we read
about in our history books. In that war the
civilian population was not affected to any
large extent. It was, you might say, a professional war. But since then the whole world
has -changed. While we were at peace with
the world some people were preparing for
an-ther war, and many clear thinkers prophesied that it was only a matter of time till
we would be back in a struggle again, but
maybe not with the same nations. As a result
of the NATO agreement, apparently, there is
peace in Europe, a peace which may last, so
far as we know, for the next four or five
years. Whether or not Russia or her satellites will attack Europe some day is a question. In the meantime, as I say, there is
peace in Europe. But that is not true of Asia.
Asia is in a fôment. Up to about three or
four years ago I thought-and I presume

others thought so too-that the finest people in
eastern Asia were the Chinese. I remember
that when I was on the west coast, in 1903-04,
everybody in that part of the country said,
"We have a lot of Japanese here and a lot
of Chinese, but the Chinese are the people you
can trust and with whom you can do business." That was the general opinion across
Canada for many years until the Chinese got
infected with a virus which apparently has
brought about a change.
Today in east Asia, where many of the
primary products of the world, such as rubber,
tin, and other important materials, are produced, there is a struggle on for their control.
Our hope of successful resistance to China,
with its 500 millions, to Russia, numbering
over 200 millions, and to some other Asiatic
powers whose teeming populations are
dominated by communisin, depends on the
help which we can count upon from the
United States, Japan, New Zealand and
Australia. There may be some aid from
Malaya; maybe Great Britain will help; but
I cannot but agree with an editorial which
I read today in the Winnipeg Free Press, to
the effect that although fighting against communists has been going on in Malaya and
other countries for several years, the western
states never seemed to have wakened up to
the full menace of Eastern Asia; and it is
only now, after the heroic French defence
in Indo-China, that the world has been
brought to a realization that a great struggle
is going on in that country for the control of
its millions of people. We Canadians, and
the Americans, who are the same kind of
people as ourselves, with the same problems,
have been slow to recognize how important it
is that these Asiatic people should understand
that neither Canadians nor Americans have
any design to wield economic or military control over them. I do not agree with the
opinions of Nehru of India; I am more in
accord with the Premier of Pakistan, whose
views on this matter, I think, are the right
ones. We in the western world do not want
colonies, we are not imperialists; we have
no thought of domination. All we want to
do is to bring to these peoples some of the
blessings of freedom and civilization, which
we believe are better than anything the Russians can offer.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The present agreement will
be of great value if it helps to convince the
people of Japan that we in the West have no
designs on their country, their government,
their religion, or anything else that is theirs.
For that reason I am very strongly in favour
of ratification of the agreement.

MAY 19, 1954
Some one may say that because I am from
Western Canada, which produces large quantities of wheat, barley and fiax seed, I cannot
but be in favour of this treaty. But, no matter what benefits the treaty might bring us
in the marketing of these products, if I
believed that its effect would be to turn
Japanese opinion against Canada or Canadian
interests, I would be against it. We hope
that we shall be able to take enough Japanese
exports to make the agreement satisfactory
to them as well as to us. It is of course true
that the people of western Canada, and particularly of the three prairie provinces, are
in favour of this agreement. But it relates
not only to wheat, barley and flax-seed, it
provides for the entry of Canadian pulpwood,
and in this respect will benefit British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and probably New
Brunswick. The agreement also applies to
such base metals as copper, zinc and lead,
which are produced in several provinces.
Honourable senators, while I am generally
in favour of the agreement I should like
to point out what may happen if we approve
its ratification.
Yesterday afternoon the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Beauregard) gave the house a clear
explanation of the terms of the agreement.
He pointed out that it is to continue in effect
for a period of one year from the date of its
entry into force, after which time either contracting party may terminate the agreement
upon giving three months' notice. The agreement provides for the evaluation of goods in
certain circumstances, and so on. Canada's
import-export trade is subject to change.
Wheat, oats, barley, livestock, pulpwood, and
mineral products form the backbone of our
present trade, but let us not forget what has
happened to our once thriving textile industry. Hundreds of our textile workers are
facing unemployment because products of
the Canadian industry are unable to compete
with cheaper products imported from other
countries.
After 1878 Canada's two great political
parties bitterly opposed each other down
through the years on the question of free
trade versus protective tariffs. But the dispute finally ended when, after the late war,
all Canadians came to realize that the best
hope for world peace lies in world trade.
We know how good will can be built up
through interprovincial trade. If, for instance,
firms in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are
able to deal with one another to their common satisfaction, it helps to bring about a
happier relationship between the people of
these provinces. As a member of a Manitoba
firm I can say, "I don't care what anybody
else says about people of Ontario or Quebec.
I know they are fine people, for I have been
83280-32

doing business with firms in Hamilton and
Quebec City for some thirty years now and
they have always given me the best of
service." Well, in this respect trade between
countries is the same as trade between provinces. Our chief difficulties stem from comparative production costs. A short time ago
the British Columbia Electric Company
Limited called for tenders from Canadian
and British electrical firms on laying a cable
between the mainland and Vancouver island.
The tenders of Canadian firms ranged around
$4 million, whereas British firms tendered at
around $3 million. According to Canadian
manufacturers of electrical equipment, lower
wage rates in Great Britain accounted for
this difference.
Canadian goods have to compete with goods
produced by cheaper labour in such countries
as Germany, India, Japan, Malaya, IndoChina and even China. I do not complain
when our factory workers seek wage rates
comparable to those enjoyed by other citizens
of this country.
But employers in this
country have to pay high taxes as well as
high wages. When a company is taxed
about 50 per cent of its profits, to start with,
a profit of $1 million nets in reality only half
a million, because the other half goes to
the government in taxation. The employees
also are heavily taxed. When a labourer is
paid, say, $2 an hour for an eight-hour day,
a part of his earnings is deducted for income
tax before he gets his pay. These taxes enter
into the cost of living in this country. I
am not saying anything about that fact at
the moment, other than we must not forget
it. The other day when some British ships
landed in Montreal with British crews, it
was said that the sailors were paid $70 a
month, with board, but that Canadian sailors
are paid $208, with board. These are facts
that we are faced with today. The people of
Canada who will be in favour of protection
will be those working in the factories, because they will try to hold to their standard
of living. I do not blame them. If I were
a labourer I would look at it from the same
viewpoint, and I believe every other member
of this house would also.
I am pointing out some of the consequences
that could flow fron this treaty which we
are asked to approve. It is a fine thing to
advocate trading between nations, and I am
al for it, but we must not overlook the
problems that may result. The farmers of
Western Canada would very much like an
opportunity to sell their wheat, barley and
flaxseed. As they say out there, "We are
loaded to the eyes with wheat just now".
None of the 1953 crop is sold yet, and I do

SENATE
flot think ail of the 1952 crop is sold. There
is no place to put ail this wheat, sa it is
just left ta lie an the ground.
I bring this ta the attention of hanourable
senators because I arn persuaded that when
Canada makes a treaty with another country,
it should do sa with its eyes open, knowing
what may happen as a resuit. Recently I
read in a national magazine-I think it was
MacLean's-an account of a man who warked
in a textile factory in New Brunswick, if I
remember rightly. His father had worked
there before him. The factory closed down,
and this man and his family were deprived
of their earnings. It is very easy ta praise
a treaty like the one befare us, but I want
ta point out ta honourable senators the
problems that may corne later.
I hope Japanese producers will not try ta
undercut the sales price of the ordinary
products af this country. If they do, they
will meet resistance that will result in a
struggle between the people of this country
who want ta seil raw materials and thase
Who want ta seil manufactured goods. 1 raise
these questions because I think that as a
senator I aught ta do so. The people of
Canada should realize that the seller's rnarket
is aver and that we are now in a buyer's
market.
Some Hon. Senatars: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I always tried ta tell the
people the truth, and they seemed ta like it,
for they kept voting for me. I sympathize
with the people who are rnanufacturing goods
and also with the people who work in their
factories. In that connection, I should like
ta tell a story. In 1914 I was running as a
candidate in a suburban constituency, where
ail the people worked in the C.P.R. shops. I
was the father of several children, and at
about haîf past five when I arrived home from
the office my youngsters would run out ta,
greet me, shawing they were glad ta, see me.
I gat the idea that I was the only Dad araund
there, and that rny children were sornething
special. When canvassing in rny constituency,
which was outside the city of Winnipeg, I
used ta start calling at the homes about hal!
past four in the afternaon. In those days
warnen did not have a vote, so, if a husband
was not home frorn wark I would wait for
hirn. His wages would be about $150 per
month, and his clothes would be ail dirty from
working in the shop, but his children would
run out ta greet hlm and hang on ta him,
just as my children did ta me. Sa I said ta
mysel!, "As long as you live, John T., neyer
forget that experience". And I have neyer
forgatten it.
Men and wornen like ourselves have a
respansibility ta Canada and should speak
frankly when we are discussing a rnatter such
as this agreernent. It cannot fail ta meet wîth
some disappraval; its efiect cannot be ail good
or ail bad. I hope that we as Canadians wîll
try ta deal in a fair way with any prablems
that it rnay lead ta. I wîll do rny best, and
I arn sure every ather member a! this house
will, ta make the treaty a success; but let us
remember there are two sides ta the story.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Recently when the railways
estirnated that a certain demand for increased
wages wauld cast themn an additional $60
million a year, Mr. Hall, the head of a
praminent railway brotherhood, said "Let
them get the rnoney". Hawever, the last time

I would like ta, make a few remarks on this

which they mix with rice. We ail realize that
since the recent war Russia's activity in and
around Japan has so hemmed in her population as to force her to produce goods for
export in order to exist.
If I have any fault to find with this agreement, it is only as to its escape clauses by
means of which Canadian manufacturers may
appeal to our government for restrictions
that would interfere with the function of the
agreement. I would point out to the manufacturing interests of Canada that their
greatest market is among their own people.
For instance, the very expensive farm machinery manufactured chiefly in Eastern Canada
is sold to purchasers in Western Canada.
Now when a market for some of the products
of the West is being found in Japan, I plead
with the manufacturers of Eastern Canada
flot to interfere. For if we do flot carry out
the terras of this agreement Japan wfll be
forced to trade wlth Russia and wrnl buy her
food requirements there instead of in Canada.
I have often thought that while protection
for manufacturers was necessary in the
earlier days of Canada, we have today developed such material resources and manufacturing techniques that-in the textile
industry, for instance-have reached a point
where they must expect to compete with
the rest of the world. It may be true that
labour's demands are pricing our manufacturers out of the world markets. But be that
as it may-and I know I will be criticized
for the remark I am about to make--Canada's
general policy of shorter hours and a five-day
week do not add anything to her position in
thxe world today. Our young men and women
do flot require these long week-ends to keep
in good health. However, my main anxiety
is that the industrial interests of Eastern

83280-32 J

Canada should not be too hasty to rush to
the governiment and seek to take advantage
of the escape clauses in this agreement.
The honourable leader on this side <Hon.
Mr. Haig) has told the house of the huge
piles of surplus wheat in Western Canada.
From a straight business point of view, I
think that is the poorest kind of publlcity we
could have. Being a wheat grower myself
and f amiliar with the situation, I know of no
manufacturer or producer of other goods
whose surplus stock is so widely publicized
as is the grain-grower's.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said he was only giving the
facts.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But those are not the
facts. The fact is that there is flot now one
bushel of wheat on the ground in Western
Canada.
Borne Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Horner: 1 have travelled throughout the country a good deal, and have learned
that the farmers who at one time had somne
wheat outside have now moved it into the
granaries. In towns in the area in whlch I
live, elevators whlch could hold perhaps haîf
a million bushels of wheat are now empty,
and under the quota systemn of deliveries they
cannot be filled. Anyway, it does not do our
position any good to, keep talking about a
wheat surplus.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I hope
this trade agreement with Japan will be a
success, and I amn delighted to support it.

CANADA-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON
COMMERCE
MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF RATIFICATIONDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Beauregard:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament approve the ratification by Canada of the

Agreement on Commerce between Canada and
Japan, signed at Ottawa on March 31, 1954, and that
this house do approve the same.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate I want
at the outset of my remarks to commend the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Beauregard), who introduced the resolution and made the necessary explanations. It
is the first lengthy speech that I have heard
him make in the Senate since I came here.
I sincerely think he did a splendid job, and
I say that for the record.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I also congratulate the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) on
his speech of yesterday.
The position that I am going to take this
afternoon may come as a surprise to many
honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Not a bit.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I say that because for many
long years in the House of Commons I took
a definite stand against the Japanese. In the
course of my remarks I want to state briefly
why I did so and why I have now changed
my attitude towards Japan. And so right
away I wish to assure honourable members
that I am entirely in agreement with the
treaty.
I am one of those who believe that if we
desire to better our trade relations with a
country it is perhaps as well that we know
something of its people and history, so I will
take a few minutes to outline briefly to honourable senators something about the people
of Japan and their history, and I trust this
will give the house a better idea of how
these people think and act. Many in this
country do not realize, when speaking about
Russia and other Asiatic countries, that the
people of those countries do not think or
act along the same democratie lines as we
in this country do.
Very early in its history Japan developed a
system of indirect rule of government, which
remains to this day. For three centuries, from
the year 670 to 1050, the aristocratic family
of Fujiwara ruled. Then followed rule by
three hundred clans, headed by a generalissimo or, as he is called in Japan, a shogun,
and that system of government lasted for
the next 700 years. The feudal age in Japan
culminated in one of the most extraordinary
episodes recorded in human history. Japan
closed her doors and went into complete isolation from 1636 to 1855. During that period
Japan was a sealed country; no Japanese was
allowed out and no foreigner was allowed in.
No ships of over one hundred and fifty tons
were built, and all existing vessels of larger
capacity were destroyed. Japanese mariners

MAY 20, 1954
were ordered to confine themselves to coastwise traffic under pain of death. Christianity
was extirpated, through the slaughter of
scores, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of
converts, and not one was left alive.
This isolation was broken in 1855, when
Commodore Perry, of the United States Navy,
compelled the then shogun's government to
admit foreign goods and people into the
country. Japan's development after that was
very rapid. In no more than fifty years an
Asiatic feudal state modernized itself with
astonishing effectiveness and took its place
among the great powers of the world. Never
before in the history of mankind has a government sent a nation to school and carried out
the experiment with greater efficiency. May
I say here that long ago I had personal
knowledge of certain methods used by the
Japanese. I well remember that in the days
of my youth, when I was an apprentice to
the engineering trade, Japanese students
visited our factory, as no doubt they visited
many more, and we opened our doors and
showed them everything we had, without
realizing the purpose of the visits or what
might result from them. The British organized the Japanese Navy; the Americans
created a modern educaticnal system in
Japan; it was a Frenchman who codified the
Japanese laws; Germans directed the nation's
higher medical education and modernized
their Army; and an Englishman gave Japan
a uniform currency. And so, just twenty
years after acquiring a seat on the League of
Nations council, Japan believed herself strong
enough to make war on the United States
and the British Empire. It was her ambition
to found a greater empire than had yet
existed, enabling her to control 600 million
people; and only time will tell whether failure
to do so will doom her to a minor position,
dominated perhaps by an awakened China,
or leave her still a mighty force in Asia.
I come now to the point where I want to
explain the reason for my stand in days past.
Those of us who live in British Columbia
know more about Orientals, and specifically
Japanese, than do the people of any other
province, because practically 100 per cent of
the Japanese population of Canada was
located in our province. Years ago we discovered what Japan was aiming at. We had
proof that hundreds of their nationals who
occupied strategic positions in their army,
navy and air force had been assigned definite
duties while Tokyo waited for the time to
strike. I think we can safely say that important events are occurring at this time,
and that if Canada ever has trouble with
Russia hundreds of people in this country
will be looking forward to giving some assistance to our enemy.

However, I will resume the story I have
to tell regarding Japan before the war. Knowing what was going on-having proof of itmany people, of whom I was one, took a
stand against the Japanese and Japanese
infiltration. Nevertheless, we were accused of
fomenting racial hate; some of us were called
unpleasant names; for we could not make the
people of the eastern and the midwestern
provinces aware of the danger. It is certain
that no one can tell what might have happened if the Japanese had been victorious
in the last war.
I have pointed out how Japan is governed.
The government is not, as in Canada, carried
on by the elected representatives of the
people. For at least 700 years the military
authorities have been dominant in Japan.
Look at the situation just prior to the outbreak of the late war. It is now known with
certainty that but for disagreements on
strategy among the Japanese military
authorities, their armed forces would have
launched an attack on this continent. It
happened that the dispute in the high command was won by the air force and the navy,
and as a consequence the enemy struck at
Pearl Harbor. Had the dispute been settled
in favour of the army, Japan might well have
attacked Alaska and British Columbia. I do
not suggest that this action would have meant
defeat for the Allies, but the Japanese military machine would certainly have gained a
foothold in North America, for there was not
a single fortification to defend these territories.
Many people on the west coast were aware
that hundreds of modern Japanese fishing
boats lay scattered in strategic positions all
along the coast from the Yukon to the Mexican border. They were just waiting for the
order to attack. Japan was defeated in the
war, so it is easy now for people to criticize
the Canadian government for having moved
Japanese-Canadian citizens from British
Columbia to the interior and to eastern points.
But had those same people lived in British
Columbia in those dark days, not knowing
where Japan was going to strike, they would
have been among the first to support the
government action. Incidentally, a great many
of the Japanese-Canadians, particularly those
who were moved to Alberta, have since
informed me that they have done much better
for themselves in their new surroundings
than they would have done had they remained
in British Columbia.
Honourable members, before dealing with
the agreement itself I should like to make a
few more comments about Japan. As a resuit
of the late war Japan lost many of her
possessions. The peace treaty deprived her,
a nation of 86 million people, of at least 45

SENATE
per cent of her possessions, and of part of
her fisheries. Indeed, it Is only because of the
liberal aid given by the United States that she
bas been able to carry on. I think it bas
been unwise to dispossess her so completely.
It often happens that people are too close to
passing events to evaluate their historical
significance. Let me give an illustration. After
the Boston "Tea Party" some men in England
actually committed suicide because one of
the colonies had dared to rebel against
British rule. But I am sure we are all thankful now that the United States has become the
powerful nation she is today. In spite of any
criticism that can be made of her foreign
policies, her power and strength form the
greatest bulwark in the world against Russian
domination.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then there is Alaska. The
man who purchased that territory for the
United States, William H. Seward, almost
had to fiee his own country, and the American newspapers of the day used banner headlines to refer to "Seward's folly". But does
anyone doubt that the people of North
America would be far more uneasy today
if Russia still owned Alaska? And what
about Korea? In 1910, five years after the
Russo-Japanese war, Japan annexed Korea,
and I think we can look upon that event as
a blessing, for it is not difficult to visualize
what a terrible menace it would be to the
western world if Russia were in control of
Korea today. However, during the recent
war Japan lost Korea. At the time when
Japan annexed the country the Koreans were
exceedingly backward, by our standards, and
they are still somewhat backward today. I
wonder if it is wise to give complete freedom of government to so backward a people.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said that neither the United
States nor Canada has military designs on
any territory. That is correct. But what we
are dealing with here is a trade agreement,
and the Japanese hold some resentment
against the Americans and the British for
having opened trade with Japan in the first
place, and they dislike the manner in which
the United States is trying to control trade
now. The United States is in a powerful
position to dominate Japanese trade, for she
bas aided Japan to the extent of $2,500 million. Latest figures show that exports from
the United States to Japan last year totalled
in the neighbourhood of $560 million, against
total Japanese exports to the United States
of approximately $260 million. Only 16 per
cent of the land in Japan is arable, and it
must be remembered that in that country
there are 3,600 persons to the square mile.
The present population of about 86 million

is gr:,wing at the rate of 1,200,000 per year.
That is a large population to feed, and
those people have been seriously dispossessed.
How can we, a sparse population in a land
of plenty, having so much of God's goodness
and material riches bestowed upon us, refuse
to do something to help Japan, even though
she was a ruthless enemy only a few years
I cannot say what yardstick should

be used to measure the degree of help we
should give, but I know that we have not
adopted toward Germany or Russia the
adverse policy that bas been adopted toward
Japan.
Of course, Canada is not trading with
Russia, although Great Britain is. I am one
of those who feel that Russia is putting up a
great big bluff about mutual trading. Statements emanate from Moscow that Russia is
willing to trade with any other country, but
inside information discloses that she is not
in a position to do so, because her own people
need practically all the foodstuffs she produces, and even more. Further, she has not
sufficient gold or currency to carry on much
foreign trade. Perhaps we in Canada will
come around to trading with Russia some
day. We know that Germany, for instance,
has not had held against her by other countries the ruthless acts of aggression and the
millions of murders she committed; on the
contrary, we have forgotten all that, and are
willing to trade with her today.
I want to direct the remainder of my
remarks toward the trade agreement before
us. The tables placed on the record by the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Beauregard) in his speech of Tuesday
are very enlightening. I note that in 1939
we exported to Japan 17 commodities, having a total value of $21,045,000. In 1953 we
exported 44 commodities, with a value of
considerably more than $118 million. These
tables reveal that 80 per cent of our total
exports to Japan in 1939 were metals, valued
at $18,166,000, and that the value of our
1953 exports of metals to that country was
$20,882,000. This increase in dollar value of
metal exports is particularly interesting in
the light of the severe criticism that was
levelled at Canada in 1939 for shipping
metals to Japan.
I emphasize, honourable senators, that we
must not lose sight of the fact that there has
been an infiationary trend in Japan as well
as in Canada. The statement has been made
that if you take the wholesale figure for
Japan in 1937 as 100, it is today 27,000. A
story told me by a friend who, as a member
of the United States navy, was on duty in
Japan just prior to the departure of Chiang
Kai-shek from China, illustrates quite well
the dangers of runaway inflation. My friend

and another gentleman were invited by a
praminent Chinese businessman ta dinner at
one of the flnest hotels in China, and at the
conclusion of the meal the businessman
remarked that aver a number of years he
had paid into a company as insurance for bis
son's education in the United States a total
of $4,500, and that very marning he had
received a cheque refunding the full amaunt.
He showed themn the cheque for $4,500.
AIangside it he placed the check for the
dinner-which amounted ta $5,200.
When we talk about aur imports from
oriental countries, it is necessary that we
know samething of the true manetary value
of the goods we are receiving.
It is perhaps only natural that people in
certain provinces should oppose this treaty
with Japan. I do not want to be accused of
kicking about industries in Ontario and
Quebec, but it seems strange ta me that
there is always an outcry from them against
the entry into Canada af any gaods which
might be in any way campetitive with
gaads manufactured within these provinces.
Frankly, I do not know how we can solve
this trade problem, yet satisfy and protect
everybody. It is all very well ta say "Shut
everything out." I well remember the kind
of doctrine that was preached by many
people in the years 1930 ta 1935, that if we
manufactured everything we used in Canada
employment would increase. But it did nat
wark out that way; indeed, the mare that
that palicy was pursued, the less emplayment there was.
There bas been a cry fromn the central
provinces-and particularly Ontario-against
the entry of Japanese goods ita Canada.
I have laoked over the list a! imports fromn
Japan-it is flot a formidable list-and I
cannot see how it will seriously affect such
an industry as textiles. No undue amaunt
o! money is being spent by Canadians in
the purchase af textiles from Japan. Those
people who cry out against Japanese goads
make the same pratest against the entry of
goods from almast any country, even from
the United States.
If I may point ta what I think is wrong
with aur affairs today, it is that the housewives of this country are paying too much
for what tbey have ta buy, and that the high
cast is nat entirely the resuit af hlgh wages.
I say withaut fear o! successful contradiction
that most articles baught for the home in
Canada could be bougbt cheaper across the
lie. You ask me wby that is so. Weil, I
will be criticized for saying so, but I believe
it is because many Canadian merchants are
taking toa much profit. This is a prosperaus
country; we have only ta look at the bank
balances ta realize how prosperous we reaily

are. Look also at the way stocks are gaing
up in value, and at the same time listen ta
the cry of perdition that goes up from a lot
of people who are exceedingly weil off.
People of that type will flot like what I
have ta say, but I speak, I hope, for the
ordinary citizen of Canada. When I hear talk
against aur helping Japan and other countries
through the Colombo plan ta enjoy some of
the good tbings God bas given us, I sametimes wonder whether aur selfishness wrnl
allow us ta do ail we should do. As I say,
we have strong protests from certain interests
against this very treaty. For instance, the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association bas
gone s0 f ar as ta say ta the gavernment,
"If you allow Japanese goods ta came into
this country, you must bave them stamped
with the naine of the country of origin."
Let me point out that that doctrine is a twaedged sword. At one time the United States
required that ail goods imported from Canada, such as lumber and canned fish, bad
ta be stamped "Canada". Anyane who is
familiar with conditions in the United States
knows that in that country there are same
people who adopt a policy that they wiil nat
use or buy an article made in Canada or any
ather outside country-people, for instance,
so nationalistically minded that they wiil not
use lumber that is stamped "Product of
Canada". 1 may say that I warned against
stampîng the namne of the country a! origin
an every article that is exported, because it
tends ta raise a nationalistîc feeling against
the country that exparts the goads.
I nated with some interest the presence of
the saving clauses in the treaty, but I say
quite frankly that I arn not too sanguine
about saving clauses generaily. Let me ask
how many senators realise that the agreement known as GATT, entered into by
representatives o! Canada, bas neyer been
approved by parliament. I was amazed ta
learn this from a statement made ini the
House o! ýCammons: the ather day by the
Right Honouraýble C. D. Howe. It was my
impression that when aur trade emissaries
and commissioners enter ita an agreement
o! this nature on bebalf o! the government
it is brought befare parliament and we have
an opportunity ta examine it. Weil, as far
as that particular agreement is concerned,
we have had no chance ta see it. I mention
this because that agreement, Jike this one
with Japan, cantains a saving clause which
was inserted with the idea of protecting
certain industries. But, bonourable senators,
wen complaints are made against a saving
clause there are many reasons and excuses
advanced why such a clause cannot 'be inivoked. That is wby I say that I arn not too
sanguine about saving clauses in treaties.

SENATE
I do not intend to review the exports and
imports that will receive preferential treatment under this agreement. All that information has been placed on the record by the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Beauregard). I may be wrong, but I do
not think that the toys, pottery, chinaware
and so forth that we will import from Japan
will greatly affect our industries. True there
are industries in this country engaged in the
manufacture of pottery, but I think a comparison would indicate that their product is
not of the kind that will come in from Japan.
Our stores carry special cups and saucers
and ornamental chinaware made in Japan.
In this connection I think there should be
competition in prices between the products
of the two countries, but up to the present
time the prices seem to be about the same.
If our merchants can buy these classes of
goods cheaply in Japan, why is the advantage not passed on to the Canadian public?
And we should remember that it is not the
housewives who are complaining about the
importation of oranges, chinaware and other
articles of that kind. It must be that the
complaints are emanating from those who
have money invested in business and are
afraid they are going to lose a lot of trade
or profits.
The sale of wheat and barley to Japan is
all to the good, especially when we consider
that in Canada we are eating less wheat than
we formerly did. I was surprised to learn the
other day that the consumption of wheat and
fiour in Canada had dropped during the past
ten years from 41 bushels per capita to 3½
bushels. Of course, we have all kinds of food
in this country and we can afford to be discriminating. Somehow or other the story has
got around that people are eating too much
bread, and so a great many people are turning to brown bread, which is supposed to be
made out of the whole wheat grain. I may
say in passing that some of this brown bread
is not whole wheat bread at all, but nothing
more than white bread dyed brown. That is
the sort of thing that is being put over on
the public. I would say that you might as
well eat white bread as this dyed bread.
I would like to see Japan given an opportunity to make a comeback. We must, at
least, trust her. The war is over and she
was defeated. But she is going to rise again,

and perhaps quickly. Did honourable senators note in the press the other day that
Japan is already competing for trans-Pacific
air passenger traffic? She is using modern
planes.
There is a cry in Japan which will not
down, that she was defeated because her
military might was not strong enough. I
trust, however, that she will not make the
same mistake again. We should deal with
these people and endeavour to lead them
along the right path to peace, treating them
as equals. I am one of those who believe
that we use the word communism far too
lightly. There may come a time in the history of the world when we may have to pay
a price for the treatment that the Chinese
and other Asiatic nationalities received in
days gone by from very greedy traders.
Those people do not forget such things, so
we had better have Japan on our side.
Now that Japan is on the way up I would
say let us treat her fairly, let us take her
goods. The idea that you can sell all your
surplus goods to another country and not buy
its goods in return is just about as foolish
an idea as can be imagined. There is only
one method of paying for the goods you sell,
and that is by buying from the purchasing
country the goods it has to sell.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: So I say, honourable senators, let us give this treaty our blessing. The
Japanese people are on trial. We need their
good will, as they need ours, especially in
view of the menace of the Soviet. Do not
overlook the fact that in Japan there are
Soviet representatives proclaiming that Russia is willing to trade with the Japanese.
Russia, as everyone knows, is willing to
sacrifice her goods to another nation so long
as she can buy the good will of that nation
and at the same time interfere with the
plans of the western powers.
Honourable senators, for the reasons that
I have given, I am in favour of the treaty
that is now before us.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, the debate
was adjourned.

CANADA-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON

APPROVAL OF RATIFICATION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
20, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Beauregard:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament approve the ratification by Canada of the
Agreement on Commerce between Canada and
Japan, signed at Ottawa on March 31, 1954 and
that this house do approve the same.

nations do not receive the preferential treatment accorded to the British Commonwealth
group. This is something that needs to be
clearly understood, and I may refer to it
later in connection with some of the socalled saving clauses of the agreement
before us.
I want to say a word of congratulation to
the honourable senator for Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), because, when he sponsored
the resolution of approval of the peace treaty
of 1951 between Canada and Japan, he in
large measure opened the way for a debate
on this motion to ratify a trade agreement
between the two countries.
I take the
liberty of bringing to the attention of honourable senators his speech of March 28,
1952; and if I make a few quotations I do so
not merely for the purpose of praising the
honourable senator, but to bring clearly the
attention of the house to the fact that the
present agreement, though naturally it will
be subject to some opposition in the country,
has its foundation in the treaty of peace with
Japan. This fact is evident from the lucid
speech which the honourable senator from
Inkerman delivered two years ago last
March, long before any agreement on trade
with Japan was negotiated. He then quoted
from the preamble of the treaty of peace:
Whereas Japan for its part declares its intention
to apply for membership in the United Nations
and in all circumstances to conform to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations; to
strive to realize the objectives of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights; to seek to create
within Japan conditions of stability and well-being
as defined in articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of
the United Nations and already initiated by postsurrender Japanese legisIation; and in public and
private trade and commerce to conform to internationally accepted fair practices.

the agreement for trade between Canada and
Japan, I wish to express compliments to the

of the logical consequences and conclusions of that
arrangement. We stand on the threshold of some
great realignment of forces, and it remains to be
seen whether Japan is to be permanently included

MAY 25, 1954
point where her production is largely
dependent on the finding of export markets.
As one who now lives in British Columbia,
and formerly lived in New Brunswick, I
have in mind the problems of the lumber
industry, for which our domestic markets are
so meagre that whenever there is the
slightest danger of losing even a portion of
our export markets the producers are almost
thrown into a panic.
We must correct this situation, and in my
opinion the best way to do so is by increasing our population. It is my sincere hope
that the population of Canada will continue
to increase for some years to come as it has
in late years. Honourable senators may have
read a recent news item to the effect that
one out of every fifteen people in Canada
today came here since the close of the war
in 1945. We all know of the extensive
economic development that has taken place
in Canada during the last decade, and we
also know that the only threat to the continuation of that development and an
expanding economy is our lack of foreign
markets and the meagre domestic markets
for our products. So we must do all we
can to increase our own population, taking
proper care of seasonal unemployment and
fluctuations in the demand for labour as they
occur. If we do this our consumption of
both primary and secondary products will
increase and become a strong feature of our
trade and commerce.
I am not sure that it is possible for parliament to give helpful study to the problem of
the ever-increasing cost of production; nevertheless, I have a suggestion to make, not for
immediate action but for consideration. In
making this suggestion I have in mind in
particular the splendid work done by two
committees of the Senate. One was the
special committee under the chairmanship
of the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), which in 1945 and 1946
made a thorough study of and reported on
all matters affecting income tax and the
excess profits tax in Canada. It took a
couple of years to complete that work and
a couple of years to have the recommendations contained in the committee's report carried out. The work of that committee
resulted in a great deal of good, and has
been of benefit ever since in every part of
Canada and in every walk of Canadian life.
The other committee to which I refer is the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
As one who represents what is to a large
extent a gold-producing section of Canada,
I often think of the fine work done by this
committee about nine years ago. It made a

positive study of the gold mining situation
in Canada, and its chairman, the late Senator Donnelly, brought in a report which nôt
only was extremely helpful, but actually
formed the basis of the Emergency Gold
Mining Assistance Act, of 1948, which is still
in force and has helped very materially in
keeping the gold mining industry producing.
These are two examples of what has been
accomplished by committees of the Senate
set up for the specific purpose of studying
and making a report upon specific matters.
And I am now merely suggesting that honourable senators consider whether perhaps
next session the Senate might set up a committee-it is too late to set up one this
session-to study the whole question of the
cost of production in Canada, so that we may
know whether we can effectively meet competition in foreign markets, and also in our
domestic market. That brings me back to the
saving clause concerned with the cost of
production of goods which Canada will buy
from Japan. I know, as I said previously, that
many people think that this is playing to the
secondary industries, but in my mind it is not
so. This is why I referred to the admission
Japan made years ago when signing the
peace treaty, to the effect that she had been
unf air in her trade tactics previous to the
war. And I might add here that if Japan
was unfair, other countries were unfair also.
However, I am not concerned with the
unfairness aspect at the moment, but with
the possibility of making a study of the causes
of the increasing cost of production in Canada.
We are told on many sides that high wages
are the sole cause of the high cost of production. I do not agree with that statement.
I will admit that they are a part of the
higher cost of production, but every item that
has increased in cost and that is used in
manufacturing or production is also a part
of the increased cost of the finished article.
As honourable senators know, we are in
danger of excessive imports from the United
States, and it is a well-known fact that wages
paid in the United States are higher and, in
some cases, considerably higher than those
paid in Canada. It seems to me, therefore,
that we cannot say the rate of wages is the
sole cause of Canada's disadvantageous position in import and export trade. I am hoping
that before very long parliament, either
through a committee of the Senate or of both
houses, will be able to bring in some report
that can be followed by the government for
the purpose of aiding industrial production,
a report also that will give us information
enabling us to compete favourably in the
Canadian and foreign markets.

SENATE
Negotiations for the present trade agreement
were conducted with Japan during 1953. In
the 1953 report of the Department of External
Affairs, at page 25, there is an article headed
"Economic Relations with Japan", which
states:
During the year, negotiations were held with
Japan for the exchange of most-favoured-nation
treatment on trade matters.
These discussions
followed from the postwar development of trade
between the two countries and from the coming
into force of the Treaty of Peace with Japan,
article 12 of which envisages the reciprocal extention of most-favoured-nation treatment by Japan
and the other signatory governments. The negotiations have given particular attention to the need
for adequate safeguards against serious injury to
domestic producers, and to assurances of equitable
treatment of Canadian exports by Japan, having
in mind Japan's current balance of payments difficulties.
The various proposals have also been
examined in relation to the provisions of the General Agreement which might become applicable to
the commercial relations of Canada with Japan
after a bilateral agreement has been signed and
ratified.

The honourable senator who moved the
resolution (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) told us the
duration of this agreement is one year, and

after that it may be terminated on three
months' notice by either party. While I can
see some possible disadvantages in the agreement, I am hopeful that it will be carried
out, for I am sure that it will be of great
benefit both to primary producers and
industrial producers. I know there is considerable fear on the part of some employees
and also of some producers that the saving
clauses with respect to Japan will never be
carried out. I mentioned a while ago that
there is a difference between the mostfavoured-nation type of agreement such as
we are now entering into with Japan and
the agreement among the various nations of
the British Commonwealth, which no one will
deny is the most highly respected trade
treaty that Canada has entered into. Yet we
find that because of the loss of markets by
a Canadian industry, the textile industry, the
Tariff Board has been instructed to make an
inquiry into the operation of the British
preferential tariff with respect to the injury
suffered by the industry.
Honourable senators, I personally hope that
this trade with Japan will be of great
benefit to both countries.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, the
debate on the resolution has been quite brief
and I see no great purpose in prolonging it,
but I want to make just a few observations.
There has been no opposition to the resolution, I find, in either the House of Commons
or the Senate.
Opposition would not be
expected, in view of the fact that we have

been selling to Japan about eight times more
than we have been buying from ber, which
fact poses a problem. One of the worst possibilities of a continuation of that practice, it
seems ta me, is that we might just throw
Japan into the arms of those countries which
are definitely opposed to us and which we
regard today as our potential and perhaps
actual enemies. I think that in granting a
most-favoured-nation status to Japan we are
doing the right thing, and this, not only
because she needs the help so extended ta
her-no doubt she does-but because this
step is in our own interests. It is another
illustration of the old principle that, as between countries, you cannot sell unless you
buy. This, in turn, raises the question of
the tariff. I know that the opinion is held by
some people-among them, a few whom I am
looking at-that I am a supporter of high
tariffs, a high protectionist. That assumption
is quite unfair. I have never been a high
tariff man. The position I took in this regard
in another place-no, in the House of
CommonsSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -was that surely if some
other countries erected a high tariff wall
against us, our own people should receive
somie preference in our own market. That is
about as far as I ever went.
I was a little interested when my weary
friend across the way, the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), said the other
day that no longer is the tariff an issue in
this country. I was glad to hear him say so,
and I almost rose to my feet to ask him
whether he was making an official pronouncement on behalf of his party. At any rate I
hope that such is the fact. Generally speaking, the erection of tariff barriers between
varlous countries is wrong, because the only
effect is to restrict trade, and the greater the
volume of international trade the better for
all the countries concerned.
As for the agreement now before us, a
little opposition may be expected from certain quarters. Manufacturers engaged in the
production of textiles and some other products fear the effect of Japanese competition
on their businesses. To some extent their
fears may be well founded. I agree with the
senator who bas just spoken, however, that
the difficulties from which they suffer are not
due entirely to high costs of labour. It must
be remembered that the working populations
of two of our late enemies, namely, Japan
and Western Germany, are a little more ready
to put in a full day's labour than are we in
this country, and that is one factor in their
success. Another circumstance which works
in their favour is that states which were

MAY 25, 1954
losers in the recent war are not burdened
with the heavy taxation which has fallen
upon their opponents.
My friends have spoken of the saving
clause. Well, I hope resort will not be made
too frequently to that device. Personally I
have not too great a confidence in its efficacy,
nor, if it is used, that it will be used fairly.
In saying that I am thinking of a case in
which another country took unfair advantage of the saving clause in respect of an
agreement under what is generally known as
GATT-the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
The only economic remedy for countries
whose peoples are in the position of Japan
and China-I shall not include Germany,
because she is recovering rapidly-is the
raising of their standards of living. Nobody
wants to see the standard of living in Canada
reduced. We sometimes find fault with the
extent to which labour goes in its demands,
but we have no desire to see our standards
fall.
The long-range, though ultimate,
remedy, I think we must understand, is that
the standards of living in Japan, China, India
and other low-wage countries shall be raised,
and it is for us to do what we can to help
them in that direction.
In conclusion, I think the agreement is a
good one. It can be terminated in one year.
Or we can employ the saving clause, which,
as I have said, I do not regard as of any great
value. The trouble is that if it is invoked
it is likely to be used too much, and in that
event one might just as well not have an
agreement at all.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Elie Beauregard: Honourable senators . .
(Text):
The Hon. the Speaker: May I draw the
attention of honourable senators to the fact
that if the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) speaks at this
time, he will close the debate.
(Translation):
Hon. Elie Beauregard: Honourable senators, I have only a few words to add in
concluding this interesting debate.
From the substance of the Canada-Japan
treaty, as well as from the remarks to which
it has given rise in both houses, certain facts
stand out which I believe are worth
underlining.
The first one, which I will barely mention,
has to do with competition. The opening up
of foreign markets intensifies competition at
home as well as abroad. How can the
standard of living which we value and pro-

duction at competitive prices be reconciled?
I have no suggestion to offer, but in my
opinion our Canadian economy has no more
important, no more pressing, and perhaps
even no more difficult problem to solve at
the present time.
The second fact which strikes me is that
this commercial agreement which we have
just considered is not only a commercial
agreement; it is also a gesture of good will.
Some Hon. Senators, Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: In this respect, the
role of Canada is far from unimportant. Its
actions could hardly be attributed to imperialism-or rather, as it is now called, to
colonialism.
For many years, the white
races quarrelled to their hearts' content
among themselves over control of the
Western world, without admitting into the
dispute any men of a colour considered to
be of secondary importance.
Because of their military strength, the
Westerners have time and again attempted
to impose their culture and civilization upon
the Asiatic people without having beforehand sufficiently studied or understood them.
On the occasion of two great wars, the
coloured people have been quicker to absorb
technical and scientific knowledge than
courses on religion and western civilization.
To-day, under the leadership of officers and
economists, of engineers and lawyers trained
in great universities of Europe and America,
they are inclined to welcome, with weapon
in hand, those who seek alliance or friendship with them, because they, in turn, have
failed to study or understand sufficiently the
Western world.
The Prime Minister's good will tour was
a gesture well fitted to dissipate some of this
misunderstanding.
Parliament is making
another such gesture in approving this
resolution.

The motion of Hon. Mr. Beauregard was

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second

VOCATIONAL TRAINING
CO-ORDINATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 326, an Act to amend the Vocational
Training Co-ordination Act.
He said: Honourable senators, before outlining the various amendments proposed in
the bill, I intend to give the house some
information about the act itself. A foundation
for what has been accomplished under the act
was laid in the period from 1930 to 1935. In
1939 a program of youth training was
inaugurated. During the war years, from
1940 to 1944, 360,000 members of the army,
air force and navy were trained for industry.
The present Vocational Training Co-ordination Act was first enacted in the year 1942.
It was designed to provide legislative
authority for the carrying out of various
forms of training in connection with the
prosecution of the war. It was designed to
provide for training of discharged members
of the forces, and for such forms of vocational
training or assistance for vocational training
foreseen as being desirable in the post-war
period.
The act provides that all training may be
undertaken by provincial authorities, under
agreements between the federal and provincial
governments providing for financial assistance
by the federal government.
There has been established under the act
a Vocational Training Advisory Council,
which includes representatives of the provinces, employers, organized labour and other
interested groups. The work of this council
has been of great assistance in the administration of the act.
It is now proposed to revise the wording
of certain provisions of the act in the light
of present day training requirements. These
differ in some respects from those which
existed at the time the act was passed. The
changes have been discussed with provincial

MAY 26, 1954
authorities, and the Advisory Council has
expressed the desirability of changes in the
act and in the training program.
I think it will be of interest to honourable
senators to have some information regarding
the nature and scope of the training activities
now being carried on under the Vocational
Training Co-Ordination Act.
Training programs are conducted under the
provisions of four federal-provincial agreements, namely: the Vocational Training
Agreement, the Vocational Schools' Assistance
Agreement, the Apprenticeship Agreement,
and the Correspondence Courses Agreement.
Under the provisions of the Vocational
Training Agreement, the federal government
co-operates with the provinces in the following types of programs:
(a) training of former members of Her
Majesty's Forces who are approved for such
training by the Department of Veterans
Aff airs; to the cost of which the federal
government contributes 100 per cent;
(b) training for unemployed workers
referred by the National Employment Service,
and for whom such training is required to fit
them for suitable employment; to which the
federal government and the provincial government contribute an equal amount of 50 per
cent;
(c) trades training for members of the
armed forces and the provision of civilian
instructors for schools operated by the armed
forces; to which the federal government contributes 100 per cent;
(d) training of skilled and semi-skilled
workers for defence production; to which
the federal government contributes 75 per
cent, and the provincial government 25 per
cent;
(e) training of foremen and supervisors in
industrial establishments; to which the federal
and provincial government contribute 50 per
cent equally;
(f) training for young people from rural
communities who are not served by the existing school systems; to which the federal and
provincial authorities each contribute 50 per
cent;
(g) financial aid to needy worthy university
students and to nurses in training; to which
the federal and provincial authorities each
contribute 50 per cent.
Under the terms of the Vocational Schools'
Assistance Agreement financial aid is provided
to the provinces for the construction, equipment, and operation of technical, vocational
and trade schools of less than university
grade.
Under the provisions of the Apprenticeship
Agreement, training is provided in full-time

and part-time classes for apprentices registered with Departments of Labour under the
provisions of provincial apprenticeship acts.
Under the provisions of the Correspondence
Courses Agreement, the federal government
shares with the provincial governments in the
cost of the preparation of vocational correspondence courses, which are made available
under the same terms and conditions to
students in all parts of Canada.
For these purposes a total of $85 million
was expended during the period 1937 to 1953.
I now come to the amendments provided
by the bill. May I say at the outset that as
I believe further information beyond my
explanation will be required, I would suggest
that upon being given second reading the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour.
Paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of section 1
of the bill would amend section 3 of the
act by substituting the words "defence of
Canada" for the words "efficient prosecution
of the war". This change is necessary because
the purpose of the present act was to provide
training only in connection with the prosecution of the war.
Paragraph (b) of the same subsection would
substitute the words "Veterans Affairs" for
the words "National Health and Welfare".
When this bill becomes law, it is intended
that it shall be administered by the Honourable the Minister of Veterans Affairs.
The present paragraph (e) of subsection 1
of section 4 of the act reads:
4. (1) The Minister may, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, enter into an agreement covering any period with any province to provide financial assistance for
(e) the development and carrying on after the
present war of vocational training on a level equivalent to secondary school level.

The words "after the present war" are
being struck out of that paragraph, and the
following two new paragraphs are being
added to authorize agreements with the provinces with respect to additional classes of
training:
(f) any training project for the

purpose of

rehabilitating disabled persons or fitting them for
gainful employment; and
(g) any training project to increase the skill or
efficiency of persons engaged in agriculture,
forestry, mining, fishing or in any other primary
industry in Canada, or in homemaking.

Section 3 of the bill would increase the
number of members on the council from
sixteen to not more than twenty. If any
honourable senators would like to know who
comprise the present council, I have a list
of the names before me. At present only
eight provinces are represented on the

SENATE
council, and the increase in membership
would permit all provinces to be represented.
There is one other amendment that perhaps
should be mentioned. At present the department's annual report on operations and
expenditures under the act must be prepared
within 60 days after the termination of each
fiscal year, but the last section of the bill
extends the time limit to 120 days. The provision for the tabling of the report in parliament remains unchanged: it has to be tabled
as soon as prepared, if parliament is then
sitting, or otherwise within fifteen days after
parliament convenes.
Honourable senators, that briefly explains
the bill. If it is given second reading I will
then move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour,
with the suggestion that full opportunity
should be taken by honourable senators to
inquire into all phases of this matter; because, considering the amount of money that
has been spent and the training that has
been given-training in which nearly all the
provinces are interested-it is well worth
the time of honourable senators to attend
and hear the explanations by the minister
or his departmental officials.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the bill was

PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN SLOVAX LEAGUESECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading o! Bill N-15, an Act to incorporate
Canadian Slovak League.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian
Slovak League was founded in Winnipeg in
December, 1932. It secured hetters patent from
the Secretary o! State of Canada in April,
1934, and acquîred the usual corporate powers
than an organization of this kind would be
granted.
The Canadian Shovak League is both a
social and a cultural organization, with airns,
as expressed in its letters patent, "1to educate
the Slovak people living in the Dominion of
Canada; to assist and encourage them to
become loyal citizens of Canada and to upllft
them morally, economicaily, socialhy and culturally." I am informed that there are some
57 aduit branches from New Waterford, Nova
Scotia, on the east coast, to Vancouver, British
Columbia, on the west coast. In addition, the
organization has 31 junior branches. It has
a total membership of approximately 3,800
aduits and 700 juniors. Many of the branches
have real estate and other assets, which
they administer themsehves; and the central
branch has substantial assets in the way of
cash and iavestments.
I am informed by the Counsel to the
Senate that the present bill corresponds to
simular bills which the Senate has already
passed. The bull provides that the head
office of the League shail be at Fort William,
and that the organization shail be a fraternal
benefit society, with objects as specified in
section 4 of the bill.
Perhaps I should partlcularly point out
that under the provisions of subsection 2 of
section 4, the society could establish and
administer a mortuary insurance fund, a
personal accident and sickness insurance
fund, and a juvenihe insurance fund. It is
because It proposes to exercise these special
powers that the soclety is required, under
provisions of the Companies Act, to apply
to parliament for a charter, as it is now
doing. In other words, the powers to carry
out these forrns of insurance cannot be
accuuired by letters patent.
The proposals which the bihl contains on
membership, management, directors and bylaws have satisfled the Superintendent of
Insurance. I arn inforrned that until the

SENATE
actual by-laws are approved by the Superintendent of Insurance the company cannot
engage in business.
The Superintendent has also approved the
provisions of the bill with reference to the
maintenance of a general fund and such
allied matters as premiums, assessments, disposition of surplus assets, acquisition of real
estate and other matters which pertain to
the administration of such a society.
I am further informed by the Superintendent of Insurance, that he has been supplied with an actuarial report as to the
financial condition of the society as at
December 31, 1953, and that the report is
satisfactory.
I think I should also tell honourable senators that information bas reached me that
a rival organization may object to certain
features of the bill; but I would think it
appropriate that the Senate now give second
reading to the bill and refer it to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills, where representations could be heard
not only from the applicants but as well
from people who oppose certain features of
the bill. Therefore, if the second reading is
given today, I will move afterwards that
the bill be referred to that committee.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
could the honourable gentleman tell us a
little more about the rules governing the
insurance of juveniles? For instance, is there
any limit to the amount of insurance which
can be placed on children? Does he know
of any rules which protect children in these
matters? As the honourable gentleman is
aware, some gross abuses have occurred.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators, I
have to admit that I am not familiar with
details of the rules relating to insurance of
juveniles. I do know the rules are most
restrictive, for the protection of juveniles
themselves, and, I think, of parents too. As
my honourable friend says, there have been
abuses in the past. It is an extremely important problem, which could be explained in
committee by the Superintendent of Insurance. If the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will ask his
question in committee, I am sure a full
explanation will be given.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.
PUBLIC

SERVANTS

INVENTIONS

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. F. Gordon Bradley moved the second
reading of Bill 444, an Act respecting inventions by public servants.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to achieve uniformity in the
legislation dealing with inventions by servants of the crown. At present this subject
is dealt with in four different acts: the
Patent Act, the National Defence Act, the
Research Council Act and the Atomic Energy
Control Act. This bill will incorporate all
these acts into one in an endeavour to streamline the legislation, so that no group of public
servants will have any reason to feel that
discrimination against any of them is being
practised.
The principle of the bill is, I think, contained entirely in section 3, which sets out
what inventions are to be vested in Her
Majesty. The bill therefore deals with procedures to be adopted by a public servant
who has made an invention which is connected in some way or another with his duties
or his employment, and who wishes to patent
it. Provision is also made for the enactment
of regulations governing the awarding of
remuneration-or "awards", as they are called
-and the calculation of the amounts of such
awards.
The terms "department" and "public
servant" are defined in paragraphs (b) and
(c) of section 2. "Department" means a
department as defined in the Financial
Administration Act, and includes a crown
corporation named in schedule C to that act.
"Public servant" means any person employed
in a department, and includes a member of
the Canadian Forces or the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Force, and employees of
certain corporations which come under the
Financial Administration Act.
The word "invention" still bears the meaning which it derived from the Patent Act.
UpQn the completion of an invention, the
public servant who invents it shall advise
the appropriate minister of his achievement,
and shall not make application for a patent
of this invention without the written consent
of that minister. If the minister determines
that the invention is vested in Her Majesty,
the inventor may, within the period limited in
the bill, appeal to the Exchequer Court. He
may also take this step if the minister should

delay more than three months in determining
the rights of Her Majesty to this particular
invention. The minister is also empowered
to file an application that a patent for the
invention be vested in Her Majesty; and the
employee is expected to execute the documents required to complete the patent. On
the other hand, the appropriate minister
may, on behalf of Her Majesty, waive or
abandon the rights to such an invention, with
certain exceptions where the matter would
have to be approved by the Minister of
National Defence or the Atomic Energy Control Board.
In the matter of awards, the appropriate
minister may approve payment of an award
to a public servant who has made an invention which is vested in Her Majesty.
There are, of course, the usual provisions
for penalties for violations of the act, as well
as power in the Governor in Council to make
regulations for carrying out its provisions.
Honourable members may wish to avail
themselves of the opportunity to discuss
details of the bill in one of the standing committees, and if they so desire I shall move,
after second reading, that this bill be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand that
the inventions covered by the bill apply only
to those made by public servants within the
scope of their employment?
Hon. Mr. Bradley: Yes. That is set out in
section 3 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then inventions made
by public servants outside of their employment will not be vested in the crown?
Hon. Mr. Bradley: It would depend upon
the character of the invention itself. If the
invention can be related to the employee's
work within the department it may be that it
would be vested in the crown.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Otherwise the inventions
would be treated on the same basis as those
created by other citizens?
Hon. Mr. Bradley: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask the honourable senator a question about awards under
section 10? I observe that the statute is permissive. It provides that the minister may
authorize the payment of an award to a public
servant who makes an invention that is vested
in Her Majesty by this act. Does the honourable gentleman know whether it is the custom
to make awards to public servants who make
use of their inventions; and, if so, on what
basis are such awards made?

have not yet lived here for five years and
so are unable to become Canadian citizens.
No doubt honourable senators have observed
that many taxi-cabs are equipped with radio,
by means of which the drivers can communicate with their offices. A driver may obtain
a special form of licence which does not
permit him to operate a radio generally but
does permit him to operate a radio in his
taxi, and it is felt that a number of respectable immigrants, who have not yet lived in
Canada for five years, should be given the
right to obtain such a licence.
As I have stated, no one other than a
British subject is allowed to operate a radio
station in Canada. This legislation will cover
three exceptions, to apply to the classes of
non-British residents who may be required
to serve as radio operators. I have already
referred to one of these classes, landed
immigrants. The second class are a group
of aircraft pilots. Under the International
Civil Aviation Convention and various reciprocal agreements Canada is bound to recognize for use in Canada pilot licences issued
by other member states. There is no need
to emphasize the necessity for pilots of
planes to operate radio and maintain ground
contact at all times. These pilot licences are
useless without accompanying radio authority, and under this bill the pilots wil be
able to receive radio licences.
The third class exempted are personnel of
the United States Government military and
civil radio stations in Canada. Honourable
members know that under our defence
arrangement certain stations in Canada are
operated by the United States Government,
and I think we are al agreed that American
citizens who operate those stations in Canada should be properly licenced. Regulations
passed under the Emergency Powers Act
enabled them to obtain licences, and this
bill will continue their right in that respect.
There are also certain meteorological stations, operated by the United States Government, and under this bill employees of those
stations would be licensed.
Then there are certain meteorological stations operated jointly by Canada and the
United States. Citizens of the United States
employed at those stations and operating
radios would, under this bill, be granted the
right to operate radio stations.
The right to operate would be given to
American citizens who are in Canada under
an arrangement with the Canadian government. I think honourable senators will agree
that it is proper that these citizens should
be given a licence to operate the stations.
I believe 1 am right in saying that no outside country except the United States has
any stations in Canada.

I hope this bill will commend itself to
honourable members.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the leader a
question? Does the United States Government accord a similar privilege to Canadians
in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There has been no
necessity for the United States Government
to give Canadians that right, as Canada has
no stations in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
wish to express my delight at this bill-not
at the bill itself, but at what it seems to
imply. It will be recalled that the Emergency
Powers Bill came to us for renewal on three
different occasions, and each time it was
given a rough ride in this chamber. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) had some caustic things to say
about it, as also did the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I think
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) took a whirl at it, too, as also
did a number of others, including myself.
This bill indicates that the Emergency Powers
Bill will not come before parliament for
consideration at this session; if that is so, it
will be a decided relief to many of us in
this chamber. May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if my inference that we shall not
be troubled with the Emergency Powers
Bill this session is correct?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I can assure the
honourable senator that the Emergency
Powers Act will not come forward for consideration this year.
Some Hon. Senaors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot judge
whether that will be a relief to honourable
senators or not, for I was not a member of
this house when the Emergency Powers Bill
was under consideration here.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
did not intend to say anything about this
bill until my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) mentioned the
Emergency Powers Act. Like him, I am
delighted with this bill, and I think this
is the way legislation ought to come to us.
I say, quite candidly, that I am wholeheartedly in favour of the bill. When I go
back home I shall have an answer to give
to people who ask why Americans up at
Churchill, or at some inlet, or away up at
the North Pole are allowed to operate radio
stations and send out messages. I did not
have the answer before, but now I have it.
I think that statutes which authorize the
issuing of licences of any kind should specify

Hon. Mr. Reid: Why are we giving to
United States citizens the right to operate
radio stations in Canada, and the privilege
of talking over the air for a distance of one
mile or a hundred miles?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: These are United
States Government stations. Surely, we have
to trust our friends.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think the honourable
leader has missed my point. All I am asking
is whether our ships that operate up the
west coast and our citizens who live in Alaska
enjoy the same rights as we are proposing to
extend to citizens of the United States? Is
there any reciprocity in this respect between
the two countries or is the privilege all
one-sided?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; our citizens in
Alaska have the same rights as ordinary
citizens of the United States have in Canada.
But, as I say, we have no radio stations in
Alaska. If we had, I have no doubt that our
citizens would obtain the same rights as we
now propose to extend to citizens of the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But what about persons who
operate trucks or taxis with radio equipment,
and those who go into the woods carrying
walkie-talkie instruments?
I am very anxious that this bill go to a
committee of the house.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, I
am sorry I cannot cite the exact regulations
which affect ships operating off the British
Columbia coast from Puget Sound up through
the Panhandle, but I know they use radio
up there to talk to their home ports. I also
know that under the Jones Act and the coastal
regulations our ships in United States waters
do not have reciprocal rights. I think this
would be a good time to see to it that we
get reciprocal rights.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am not familiar with all the regulations and
how these rights are obtained, but I can
say definitely that we are giving no rights
to citizens of the United States that we could
not obtain from them if we needed them.
83280-33

The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has suggested that
the bill be referred to a committee. I can
assure him that neither the honourable
leader opposite nor I have any objection to
that procedure. However, if it is referred
to a committee, I would hope that the committee will sit when the bouse rises, and to
enable it to do so I will not proceed with any
other legislation this afternoon. In those
circumstances, the committee could, I hope,
report back to the house when we reassemble
at eight o'clock this evening.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. If the bill is approved by the
committee, I shall move that it be read a
third time later this day.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
it is expected that we shall receive later
this day the interim supply bill, which will
provide for supply for two months. The
house will recall that earlier this session we
passed supply for April and May. We are
now at the end of May, and it is necessary
to vote supply again for the limited period
of two months. I would suggest therefore
that the house rise at this time and reassemble at the call of the bell, at eight
o'clock this evening.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before the house rises, may
I be clear on what we now propose to
do? Is it proposed that the Committee on
Transport and Communications meet now to
consider the Radio Bill, as suggested by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), and that that committee
report back to the house at eight o'clock this
evening?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is the understanding.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) had an
advantage over me. He obviously had the
bill earlier today, whereas I did not see a
copy of it until a few minutes ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps I should not mention the fact, but I have had a copy of this
bill for three days now. As leader on this
side I have always been shown similar
courtesy.
While I am on my feet I should like to
make a general statement about the handling
of legislation by parliament. I really think
that the government should accept the
responsibility of giving the Senate more
work to do at the beginning of the session.
We have all had a great deal of experience
in life, we know how ta work, we are being
well paid, and we want to work-I do not
know of a lazy man or woman in this
chamber. Nothing is more annoying than to
come here, sit for several days and have
only a few hours work to do. We are able
and willing to work, and are anxious to let
the public know it.
I think one reason for delayed legislation
in the House of Commons and elsewhere is
the multiplicity of parties. When I was a
member of the Manitoba legislature only two
parties were represented, and the session
lasted about six weeks, but as much legislation was passed then as now, although the
session has lengthened ta two and a half
months. With four parties, debate has become a merry-go-around. I do not think anyone would accuse the Britisher of wanting
ta curtail criticism or freedom of speech, but
83280--33

Hon. Mr. Haig: The courts allow lawyers
a certain time to present their cases, and
nobody complains about that. Why then
should anyone complain if a limit is put
on the length of time that may be spent on
debate?
This session started on the 12th of November last, and except for the Christmas
adjournment and Easter recess we have sat
regularly. Yet we are still waiting for work
to do. I am not blaming the honourable
leader of this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald),
for I know he has tried desperately ta get
legislation over from the other place. I also
know that some members of the other place
do not want to hurry, because they have the
public vote in mind. This house, however,
is not influenced by the public vote. The
government must take the responsibility of
getting legislation through faster than it is
coming now. You may say that I am speaking
against freedom of speech, but it is not so. I
contend that four or five speeches should be
sufficient to complete the discussion of any
subject at one time. I was unable ta be here
until January of this year, because I had
been sick, but except for the Easter recess
I have been here regularly, and very important legislation is only now beginning ta
come from the other place. People who come
to the gallery to hear our debates get a wrong
impression and do not like it when they learn
that we sit for an hour or two on three or
four days a week. I repeat that the government must take the responsibility of seeing
that legislation is sent over here more quickly
than in the past, or we shall be having
twelve-month sessions every year. We are

honourable senators, the subject-matter of
the measure was long and carefully considered at previous sessions.
I am not criticizing the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) or his supporters in
this house, but I am complaining that the
government is not expeditious in placing
important legislation before us early in the
session. We are men and women of broad
experience in municipal affairs, in provincial
legislatures, in the House of Commons, in
law, business and agriculture; but the benefit
of all that experience is lost if legislation
reaches us too late in the session for us to
give it propér consideration. I intend, if I
am spared, to be in the house next session,
renew my protest against the practice of
allowing major legislation to be delayed until
the dying days of the session. Perhaps the
fault is not entirely with the governmentmaybe the opposition in the other house is
partly to blame-but the government must
take responsibility for the delay.

Hon. Mr. Reid: What a hope!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I assure the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that I should like to
have more legislation to present to this house
early in the session. He has been very fair
to me, saying that he knows that I have done
all in my power to expedite legislation. No
doubt honourable members of the House of
Commons will take notice of his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are very optimistic.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave of the
Senate, I move that the bill be read the third
time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And I hope they will
take notice of my remarks.
Speaking for the government supporters in
this house, I join with the leader opposite
in expressing the hope that a system may be
set up whereby legislation will reach us
earlier in the session. I agree with all my
honourable friend has said with respect to
the members of this bouse: they have ability
and experience, they are anxious to work,
and they can contribute much to the efficient
functioning of parliament in this country.
However, we are prevented from doing what
we should do because much of the business
of parliament does not come to us in time to
give it proper consideration. I say again to the
honourable leader that I hope honourable
members of the other house will take notice
of his remarks.

L'ESPERANCE DIVORCE PETITION
NEWSPAPER

ARTICLES-QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, on a question of privilege and as Chairman of the Committee on Divorce, I wish to
call to the attention of the House a number
of statements which have of late appeared
in the press with respect to an application
for divorce made one Lucien L'Esperance and
duly heard by the Committee on Divorce.
I refer first to an editorial in the Montreal
Gazette of May 21, 1954, entitled "Parliament
and Divorce" as follows:
A recent case has, in the opinion of Parliament's
get-rid-of-divorces group, brought out in sharp
relief the inability of Parliament, in its necessarily
hasty examination of Individual cases to function
adequately as a divorce court.

Let me say here that I have no quarrel
with any get-rid-of-divorces group. The
Senate has never asked for the task of hearing divorce applications, and my predecessor
in the office of Chairman of the Divorce
Committee has repeatedly in successive
sessions urged that the task be referred to a
properly constituted court, under the presidency of a professional jurist. The Senate

has continued year after year to deal with
divorce applications as an unwelcome duty,
and not as a pleasure, and I speak for every
member of my committee when I say that
all of us without exception would be glad
to be free of the task.
Su I have no quarrel with those who would
relieve us of this burden; but the change
suggested is a political problem of important
general policy, and the advocates should be
careful not to allow their predilictions as to
policy to influence their approach to matters
of administration. The administrative task
of deciding between contending litigants is
a judicial function and should not be used
or abused for political purposes.
The editorial speaks of parliament's
"necessarily hasty examination of individual
cases". I cannot speak for the Commons,
but I say that there is no undue haste in
the Senate's examination of any of the
numerous cases which each session are dealt
with by its Divorce Committee. Of the 385
cases decided this session, every one was

heard by at least three senators with
deliberation. Every person was received who
came forward and every witness was listened
to with attention, judicial calm and courtesy.
This session the committee held no less
than 108 sittings, amounting to approxinately 270 hours, which is the equivalent of
47 full court days from ten o'clock in the
morning to five o'clock at night, with an
hour for lunch. This time spent does not
indicate haste in the examination of cases.
Referring to one of the cases, that of
Lucien L'Esperance, the editorial says:
It survived the hit-and-miss examination of the
Senate Divorce Committee.

And again:
The rumblings, in due course, reached the ears
of the Senate Committee which had rushed the bill
through with many others.

The accusation that the Senate Divorce
Committee's examination was hit-and-miss,
by which is implied a haphazard carelessness
and that the bill was rushed through, is
utterly untrue and cruelly unjust, and
evidences an ignorance of what actually
takes place which is reprehensible.
This particular L'Esperance case, which
has been widely criticized in the press, was
heard by five senators-myself presiding as
Chairman, with Senators Barbour, Euler,
Farquhar and Golding-all, with the exception of myself, long-time members of the
Divorce Committee and greatly experienced;
and, as for myself, I have been attending
courts for half a century

and have

been

taking part in trials for nearly forty years.
My best answer to the charge that the case
was rushed through is to tell you that,

JUNE 1, 1954
according to the official record, the hearing
of evidence in this case only continued from
10.30 a.m. to 12.45 p.m. and from 2.00 p.m.
until 6.45 p.m., a total of seven hours
devoted to the hearing of the witnesses in
this one case, following which there was a
conference when, after some discussion, it
was decided to leave the decision over to the
following morning.
The purpose of the
adjournment was to avoid any semblance of
haste, and so that the members of the court
might think the matter over carefully before
coming to a decision. The committee met
again the following morning, when the
decision to grant the divorce was reached
unanimously.
It is generally recognized in courts of law
that the judicial officers who see and hear
the witnesses are the best judges of the facts,
that is of the truth and weight of the testimony. Courts of appeal, who only read the
evidence, are very loath to disturb the trial
judge's or jury's finding of facts. For similar
reasons, the findings of facts of the Divorce
Committee are entitled to at least respect,
and are not properly the subject of sensational remarks by individuals who have not
even read the printed evidence.
On May 21, 1954, the Globe and Mail of
Toronto published the criticism of members
of the Commons committee, who admitted
they had passed the bill before seeing the
evidence, in marked contrast to the time
and care given by the senators who heard the
witnesses. One remark reported is that
"Everything connected with it (the case)
stinks to high heaven," an extravagant statement which is altogether unjustified.
Then a fresh impetus has been given the
discussion by the extraordinary action of the
applicant in withdrawing the case, together
with a remark attributed to one of the solicitors involved impugning the truthfulness of
witnesses. I know of no official record of
this statement, nor is it unusual for litigants to disagree with opposing testimony,
but nevertheless the incident has released
some further newspaper speculation on perjury and its prosecution. Senators have only
five senses, like everyone else, and are subject to being misled by perjured evidence,
and so too are judges and juries, but this is
no justification for unfounded allegations of
crime, the smearing of witnesses, and the
undermining of confidence in our judicial
procedure. If anyone has knowledge of perjured evidence, he should tell what he knows
to the Crown Attorney for the locality in
which the offence is alleged to have been
committed, and the Criminal Code provides
the penalties.

We are not without precedent in this
regard. There is in the files of our Divorce
Committee the record of a charge of perjury
arising out of testimony given before the
committee in support of an application for
divorce. The charge was laid by the solicitor
for the respondent and the trial took place in
Hamilton, Ontario, when officials of the
Senate were summoned and ordered to produce the relevant records. The Assistant
Clerk of the Divorce Committee and two
stenographic reporters attended, and the
information brought to us by our officials was
that the accused was convicted and sentenced
to two years in prison.
In the file is the original summons to Mr.
J. O. A. Roy, the then Assistant Clerk of the
Divorce Committee, which is of interest in
this connection. It reads in part as follows:
Canada
Province of Ontario
City of Hamilton
County of Wentworth
To Wit:
Whereas information has been laid before the
undersigned Police Magistrate of the City of Hamilton and Ex-Officio Justice of the Peace in and for
the said county, that Earl Reid at Ottawa on the
14th day of February A.D. 1928, did unlawfully and
wilfully commit perjury in a certain judicial or
parliamentary proceeding before the Senate committee by falsely swearing that he rented and
occupied the room 57 Silverbirch Ave. in Toronto
on the 17th day of October 1927 and that he committed adultery with Lynda G. Loveday.

In view of this precedent, the procedure
is quite clear and well established. The
aggrieved parties or anyone having information is entitled to lay a charge of perjury
against any witness in a divorce proceeding
whom he believes on reasonable and probable grounds to have committed the perjury
offence, and I am sure that he will find the
Crown Attorney of the district in which the
offence was committed very ready to assist.
The British North America Act gives to the
provinces jurisdiction over the administration
of justice, so that the Attorney General of the
province is the chief law enforcement officer
charged with the constitutional responsibility
wherever in the province a criminal offence
is committed.
As a matter of fact there is no suggestion
of perjury in the applicant's written withdrawal of his case, a copy of which I have
before me. It reads as follows:
Desistment
In view of the publicity that has been made
around Petitioner's divorce, and in view of the
protestation of the Respondent, the Petitioner to
avoid any further publicity hereby desists from this
petition and divorce.
(Sgd.) L. L'Esperance.

SENATE
According to his written statement it is
publicity that is concerning the applicantsupplemented by the outcries of his wife.
Notwithstanding, I had Mr. Armstrong, our
Chief Clerk of Committees, write counsel for
the applicant and, on receiving no reply,
phone him. Counsel for the applicant said
that the real reason for the withdrawal was
the fact that the applicant had tendered in
the course of his business as a plumbing
contractor on two large undertakings, one
of them in the order of a quarter million
dollars, and he feared the publicity being
given his divorce proceedings would prejudice his chances of getting the contracts.
The solicitor said he had no evidence of
perjury in the evidence of adultery submitted to the Senate committee.
Let me make it clear that I and my colleagues greatly appreciate the confidence
expressed and implied over the years by
responsible members of the Commons in the
Senate and its Divorce Committee in the
matter of divorce. Our recommendations
have been relied upon almost without exception, but should there be any change in
this regard, as some noisy persons might
imply, I am perfectly agreeable to the other
place taking over the task of inquiryHon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -in which case I will
rather enjoy the role of review. Nor have I
any objection to surrendering our responsibilities to a properly constituted court,
should Parliament in its wisdom decide on
that course, but while we do perform the
judicial task I plead for understanding and
informed co-operation by all others concerned. I have no complaint to make should
the Commons at any time differ with respect
to a particular case. That is their right and
privilege, and even their duty. We may
believe one set of witnesses and they quite
honestly and reasonably may prefer to
believe the opposing witnesses, but I do ask
that such honest differences of opinion in
judicial proceedings between litigants be not
used as a political football or as a medium
for personal publicity.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 0-15, an Act to amend the
Navigable Waters Protection Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in discussing the amendments which this bill proposes
to the Navigable Waters Protection Act, I
think at the outset it would be worth while

to consider the act as a whole, so that honourable members will be able to appraise
more intelligently the purport of the amendments.
The Navigable Waters Protection Act contains three parts. Part I deals with the
construction of works in the nature of
bridges, booms, dams, wharves, docks, and
the like, in navigable waters. This part also
contains provisions relating to the removal
of unauthorized works and the construction
of authorized works.
Part III of the act, which is very brief,
deals with the establishment of ferry cables
and swing or draw bridges in or near navigable waters. Parts I and III, which are
administered by the Minister of Public Works,
are not amended by the present bill, but
Part II, which is administered by the Department of Transport, is amended.
Speaking generally, Part II of the Navigable
Waters Protection Act deals with obstructions
to navigation in navigable waters. Exempt
from its provisions are the areas controlled
by the Harbour Commissioners in the port of
Montreal and in the port of Quebec, both of
which are governed by special legislation.
Part II of the act also provides for proclaiming certain rivers, which are naturally navigable, to be exempt from the provisions of the
act. Part II also contains prohibitions against
the deposit of sawdust and rubbish in navigable rivers.
In dealing with the present bill we are
mainly concerned with sections 13 to 17 of the
act, although section 16 is the only one
actually amended. In order to understand
the purport of the amendment to this section,
I think it is desirable that the house be
familiar with the provisions of the surrounding sections.
Section 14 provides that the minister may
cause the removal of vessels, parts of vessels,
and objects of like character which obstruct
navigable waters or are likely to obstruct
navigable waters, or which constitute obstacles
to the use of crown property adjacent to
navigable waters.
Section 15 provides for the sale of such
vessels or wrecks by the minister by public
auction or otherwise, and for the payment of
the expenses incurred by him, either in placing signals or removing the wreck, out of the
proceeds of the sale.
Section 16, with which we are immediately
concerned, provides at present that the cost of
placing signals and of removing wrecks and
vessels cast ashore near navigable waters
shall be defrayed out of the proceeds of the
sale which is held pursuant to the provisions
of section 15, and that if those proceeds are

JUNE
not sufficient either the owner of the wreck
or the person through whose negligence or
fault the wreck was occasioned can be called
upon to pay whatever deficiency may exist.
In the case of Sauvageau v. The King (1950),
S.C.R., 664, the Supreme Court of Canada
decided that it was necessary in every case
for the minister to have a sale of a wreck
before he could call upon the owner or the
person responsible for the obstruction to navigation to pay his costs of the moving of the
obstruction or of placing signals to prevent
other vessels from running into the obstruction. The purpose of the amendment is simply
to provide that if the minister in his discretion
removes the obstruction to the navigable
water he is not required to have a sale of the
wreck which he removes, but he can call
upon the person responsible for the obstruction to pay the costs incurred by the department in the disposal of the obstruction. That
is the very simple explanation of the proposed
amendment to section 16.
The second amendment proposed is the
addition of a new part to the act, to be known
as Part IV. To administer Part IV the
appointment of a third minister of the crown
is proposed, in the person of the Minister
of Labour. This new part of the act provides
authority to establish regulations similar to
those made under the Emergency Powers Act
by Order in Council P.C. 2306 of May 22,
1952. That Order in Council is known as
the Great Lakes Seamen's -Security Regulations. It supplanted a previous Order in
Council of July 24, 1951, which was passed as
a consequence of the outbreak of the Korean
War and was designed for the purpose of
ensuring that the safety and security of
Canada would not be endangered by the
presence on a Canadian ship in the Great
Lakes and the Upper St. Lawrence of seamen
who might constitute undesirable security
risks. It was adopted in the light of an
existing international emergency, and I am
informed that it followed consultation with
the United States authorities. In most
respects, the provisions of the Order in
Council and of the regulations are similar
to United States security screening provisions
applicable to seamen employed on United
States vessels operating in the same waters.
For the information of honourable senators,
I might say that the term "seamen" broadly
applies to a person employed on board a ship,
and includes the master of the vessel, but
there are certain exemptions from the strict
wording of the regulations. Persons on fishing
vessels not passing through canals or locks;
police officers on patrol boats and fire fighting
boats; labourers on a casual basis for salvage
83280-34

operations, and other similarly engaged
seamen are exempt from the requirements
of the regulations.
Basically, every seaman covered by the
Order in Council is required to have a card,
issued to him by the Department of Labour,
authorizing him to accept and carry out
employment on board a vessel in the waters
I have mentioned. The application for a card
is made in every case by the seaman to the
National Employment Service. If his application is rejected he has the right to apply to
the minister to have his case reviewed by an
appeal board or advisory committee consisting
of three persons appointed by the minister.
I am informed that as of April 26, 1954, some
30,540 applications had been received and
processed under the existing regulations. Of
this number some 29,422 were cleared. As of
that date twenty applicants had been refused
regular seamen's cards, and seven of them
had made requests for review. In the case
of one of these, further investigation resulted
in his being cleared without a review by the
minister's advisory committee. In three cases,
the committee confirmed the original decision
to refuse the card. Two requests for review
lapsed: one because the subject was deported,
I am informed, and no further action was
required under the regulations; the other,
because the person concerned did not present
himself for a hearing.
The proposed new Part IV of the act has a
time limit of three years on it. At the present time the regulations are not in force,
according to my information, because the
Emergency Powers Act expired on May 31
last.
I think, honourable senators, that it would
be desirable to have the bill go to a committee. If that course is thought wise, I
shall move later that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Could the honourable
senator tell me if provision is made in the
present act or in the proposed amendments
to protect the owner of a wreck? In asking
that question I have in mind a type of raft
used on the coast of British Columbia called
the Davis raft, which carries logs piled one
upon another and extending as deep into the
water as sixteen feet. An accident or socalled act of God will sometimes cause such
a raft to break up, and in my reading of the
bill, I find no reference to what may happen
as a result of that. For that reason I am
asking whether any protection is given to the
owner of a ship or of a Davis raft who suffers
a wreck in such circumstances. For instance,
there is a light ship located at the mouth of

companies in England also were doing a
great deal of scientific research, but relatively little was done in Canada. However,
with the advent of the second World War it
became necessary to have more research
done in Canada, and this was accomplished
by the development of research laboratories
by private companies and by government
undertaking. By the end of World War II
Canada was spending on research about as
much as had been spent by the United States
prior to the war. Credit for this development
in scientific research is not entirely due to
the government; it is due to individuals, institutions, industries and universities, and to the
government through the activities of the
National Research Council. Special recognition should be given to the members of the
council, and I think it would be appropriate
to place on record the names of these men
who are giving splendid service to Canada
and doing it voluntarily.
Dr. E. W. R. Steacie is President of the
National Research Council. The other members are: C. W. Argue, Dean of Science,
University of New Brunswick; E. R.
Birchard, Vice-President (Administration),
National Research Council; A. N. Campbell,
Professor of Chemistry, University of Manitoba;
Gordon G.

Alberta; E. G. D. Murray, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University; Cyrias Ouellet, Professor of Chemistry, Laval University; G. M.

University of Toronto; Henri Gaudefroy,
Director, Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal; Abel
Gauthier, Vice Dean, Faculty of Science,
University of Montreal, and D. A. Keys, VicePresident (Scientific), National Research
Council.
Honourable senators will notice that this
council is composed of leading men in the
professions and universities all across the
country. Canada owes a great deal to the
83280-341

endeavour and interest of these individuals,
who, as I said before, receive no monetary
consideration for their services.
Returning to the period immediately prior
to the war, let me say that the matter of
scientific research was not entirely neglected
by Canada. The National Research Council
at that time had been awarding a great many
scholarships and had been encouraging research. The result was that when war broke
out and we could not rely on the United
States for the development of scientific processes, a splendid body of young scientists
who had been devoting their lives to research,
were available to us, and they rendered invaluable assistance during the war.
I should point out that although the largest
laboratory of the Research Council is located
in Ottawa, the Council also operates a
laboratory in Saskatoon, which concerns itself with agricultural problems of the west;
and there is also one in Nova Scotia, which
deals particularly with problems affecting the
Maritimes. There are besides representatives
of the council travelling across Canada, who
consult with industry. Furthermore, there
is excellent co-operation between the provincial Research Councils and the National
Research Council. In fact, the dominion,
the provinces, the universities and industry
work exceptionally well together in this
field, in relation to research problems
encountered by small as well as by large
industries. For example, the different firms
composing the pulp and paper industry have
set up a research organization which works
in close co-operation with McGill University
and the National Research Council. I should
not leave this subject without mentioning
two great undertakings with which we are
all familiar. The Polymer Corporation was
developed largely through the efforts of
people who have devoted their lives to
scientific research. The same is true of the
project at Chalk River. Although this is
concerned with problems that might be
related to war, we hope that the solution of
some vital peacetime problems will be
achieved there and eventually make life
easier for all of us.
That is all I wish to say with regard to
the National Research Coundil itself, and now
I will refer briefiy to the sections of the bill.
The first amendment clarifies the position of
the council with respect to its authority todeal with personal property in the course of
its operations.
The second amendment obviates what is
felt to be an unnecessary meeting of the
council during the latter part of the year.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

SENATE
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I ask the bouse if it will give consideration to having this bill read a third time now?
It was fully explained yesterday in the bouse,
and I think it was also explained quite fully
to the committee today. The committee made
no amendments to the bill. I suggest that
third reading should be given today in order
that regulations passed by order in council
under the Emergency Powers Act, which
expired on May 31, may be continued in
effect. I believe honourable senators are
familiar with the bill and will approve the
putting of it into operation as soon as possible. It was initiated in the Senate, and if
we give it third reading today it can go at
once to the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I inquire whether the
order in council to which this bill relates did
in fact expire on May 31? Is it not among
those which will remain in force until 1955?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, it is not valid
until 1955; in fact, it is not now in effect.
And the regulations passed under it cannot
be continued in effect until this bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move the third reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must point out that, for the bill to
be read a third time now, consent must
.be unanimous.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then on this occasion I
withdraw my objection.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
RESEARCH COUNCIL BILL

Council Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

MOTION FOR

SECOND

READING

by the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden). I have been informed
that he was expected to arrive in Ottawa
this morning by airplane from Toronto, but
owing to weather conditions it was impossible for him to get here. Under the circumstances I would move that the order stand.
The motion was agreed to, and the order
stands.
POST OFFICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill P-15, an Act to amend the
Post Office Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is quite
a simple bill, containing only one section and
two subsections. At the present time, in order
that a publisher of a newspaper or periodical
may take advantage of certain low rates
under the Post Office Act, the publication
must be posted by the publisher within the
postal area in which the place of its printing
is situated, or at the place of the head office
of the publication. For instance, if a fraternal
organization has its head office in Kingston
and has a publication printed in Brockville,
the publication, with the approval of the
Post Office Department, can be posted in
either Kingston or Brockville.
The purpose of the bill is to enable a
publisher, with the approval of the Postmaster
General, to designate some other postal area
for posting the publications. As a matter
of fact, the publisher may designate several
different places throughout Canada for this
purpose. Let me give an illustration. A
magazine that is published in Toronto may
have many of its subscribers living in Vancouver. The present procedure requires the
publisher to post the publications in Toronto
and have them transmitted by the Post Office
authorities to Vancouver for distribution to
subscribers in that centre. If he forwards
the magazines to Vancouver, for postage at
that point, he cannot take advantage of the
reduced rates. The amendment contained in
this bill will enable the publisher of a newspaper or periodical to send his publication
from where it is published to some other
pointHon. Mr. Hugessen: In bulk.

POSTPONED

On the Order for the second reading of
Bill 338, an Act respecting banks and
banking:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as you know it was intended that second
reading of this bill would be moved today

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, in bulk. I thank
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) for pointing that out. The
publications must be sent in bulk to the
outside postal point.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And bulk postage is paid?

JUNE 2, 1954
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. Under the proposed new paragraph (d) (il) of subsection
(1) of section 11 of the act the Postmaster
General has to be satisfied:
that the application of this section to the newspaper or periodical when so posted will not
adversely affect the postal revenues.

In other words, a publisher may send his
newspapers or periodicals in bulk by train,
transport or airplane to a postal point, but
he may pay the delivery charges by train,
transport or airplane to that point. If, for
instance, a newspaper or periodical is published in London, Ontario, and most of the
subscribers live in Montreal, the publication
can be trucked in bulk to Montreal at the
publisher's expense and mailed from that
point. That method, in certain instances, will
assist the publisher, by speeding up distribution. A further advantage is that at the
present time, under the International Postal
Agreement, Canadian magazines and other
publications can be printed in the United
States, brought into Canada, deposited at
any post office, and distributed at the reduced
rate. Canadian publishers, however, are at
a disadvantage in comparison with United
States publishers.
American periodicals
published, say, in Buffalo, may be flown to
Vancouver and distributed on the day of arrival, but periodicals published in Toronto
would probably go by train to Vancouver, and
there transmission and distribution would
take longer.
I wish to point out-and the honourable
senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn) brought this to my attention-that, as
specified in the amendment, transmission of
newspapers and periodicals by mail must
not adversely affect postal rates and postal
revenues.
I commend the bill to this house for favourable consideration.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
when the earlier Post Office Bill came before
us, in February, we were told that certain
matters would be reviewed and studied
further, and particularly the point now under
discussion. I am not quite clear as to exactly
what this bill implies, but I understand that
publishers may send newspapers and magazines in bulk to a certain point for distribution at a cheap rate, and from that point
they can be distributed within a radius of
forty miles free of charge. I mention the
forty-mile radius because an honourable
senator, who is a publisher, stated in committee that was so. I would like to ask the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a question. If a publisher sends
publications in bulk, say from Toronto to

New Westminster, does the act provide for
distribution within a radius of forty miles
free of charge?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The only change
that the bill makes in the act is the one
which permits the depositing of newspapers
and periodicals in the mails at a place other
than where they are published, provided
there is no adverse effect on the postal
revenues.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I ask the Leader of the Government a
question?
Some thousands of copies of
Maclean's magazine, for example, come to
the city of Winnipeg. Would the cost to the
publisher be less if he sent my copy of the
magazine as part of a bulk shipment to
Winnipeg, to be distributed by the post office
there,

than

if

he

posted

it

in

Toronto,

addressed to me?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer is that
the rate would not be less. Otherwise it
would contravene the last few words of the
bill, that the change will not adversely affect
the postal revenues.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The rate would not be
less in any event.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have a few words to say on this bill. I was
puzzled about one or two matters when Bill
168, which also amended the Post Office Act,
was before us earlier in the session, and I
am still not clear on them. And because of
the stand I took when that bill was under
consideration, I have been accused as a pickpocket by most of the newspapers in this
country, including the Ottawa Journal.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So have I.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I honestly feel that next
session the Senate should examine the whole
postal picture, and find out what is being
done about newspapers and periodicals.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is a woeful absence
of understanding as to the regulations affecting the mailing of catalogues by wholesale
and retail houses. In my opinion, we owe
it to the people of Canada to make a complete investigation of the functions of the
post office.
I compliment the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) upon his clear
and fair explanation of the bill now before
us, and I intend to vote for it. I feel it will
be beneficial to the people in the outlying
parts of Canada.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And it will be of
assistance to Canadian publishers of magazines as opposed to publishers in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. Incidentally, I get my
copy of Time, which is published in the
United States, more promptly than I do
Maclean's or Saturday Night from Toronto.
Some honourable senators have complained
about lack of work, and it has been insinuated in another place that we do nothing
anyway. Here is an opportunity to do a
public service by investigating the Post
Office. I am not criticizing the present government, for I feel it is carrying out the
policy of preceding governments, but I think
the people of Canada have a right to know the
facts about postal matters. If, after investigation, they want to leave things as they are,
that is all right with me. But I think that
at present nobody apart from the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster
General knows the actual facts. I am sure
all my friends in this house from the East
and from the West would be willing to serve
on a committee set up to make such an
investigation. We would then have some work
to do on Fridays, Saturdays, Mondays and
TuesdaysHon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
just going upHon. Mr. Haig: -besides

nothing the rest of the time.
Hon. Mr. Howard: You might get some more
divorce cases.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Such an investigation would
at least give the people of Canada authentic
information on postal matters.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
rise on a question of privilege in response
to the suggestion by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that we have
nothing to do for three or four days of the
week. That statement affects almost every
honourable senator, but it is for each to
speak according to his own conscience. For

my part, I know that I do as much work in
those days of the week as any member of
parliament.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You certainly do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think so too.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is incorrect to say that
when we are not sitting in this chamber
we are not doing anything. Any senator
who is carrying out his duties with sincerity
must have considerable correspondence with
people in his riding and elsewhere who are
interested in the business of the country
conducted in Ottawa.
I know something about what goes on in
the House of Commons-I was there for some
twenty years-and I also know what goes
on in this house. Therefore, I speak with
knowledge of the facts when I say that I
am just as busy as any member of the other
house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before moving the adjournment of the house
I would point out that the first order of business tomorrow is the second reading of the
Canadian National Railways Bill. I understand it is the intention of the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
to proceed with an explanation of the bill at
that time. I also expect that the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
will be in his seat tomorrow and prepared to
proceed with an explanation of the Bank
Bill. I do not know whether other measures
may come to this house in the meantime, but
we have at least those two important pieces
of legislation to consider.

with a high standard of living. The surest
way of debasing that standard of living and
of drying up the economy of this country
would be by adopting a foreign trade policy
which would stifie markets abroad and make
it too difficult for foreign countries to trade
in the Canadian market.
I should like now to give a little history of
banks and banking in Canada. In this connection I strongly recommend to honourable
senators the historical background of our
banking system which the Minister of Finance gave on second reading of this bill in
the House of Commons. Some of the facts
which he stated make an interesting premise
for the several proposed changes that I shall
discuss this afternoon. For instance, in 1867,
at the time of Confederation, there were in
Canada twenty-nine bank charters which
were either active or to become active; and in
addition there were three bank charters in
Prince Edward Island and one in British
Columbia. All of these provincially-incorporated banks were endorsed, validated and
continued when the provinces concerned
became part of the Dominion.
The first federal Bank Act was passed in
1871. Since Confederation some 77 banks
have obtained charters, of which 39 actually
commenced business. Out of a grand total of
72 banks-that is, the 33 which were chartered before Confederation and the 39 which
actually started operation after Confederation-26 failed and 35 were absorbed by other
banks. Of the 26 failures, half of them were
wound up without loss to the noteholders
and depositors; in the remaining 13 cases the
depositors suffered some loss.
The last bank failure in Canada, that of
the Home Bank of Canada, occurred in 1923.
I can well recall that failure, for I have said
many times since that it taught me how
not to run a bank. Although I was young in
the practice of law at that time, I was
identified with persons who were engaged in
prosecuting the directors of the bank. I will
not say that the ultimate results of the prosecution were successful-if the success or
failure of a criminal prosecution can be
measured-but I venture to say that the
public at large, the Department of Finance,
public men, and bankers learned a good deal
from that bank failure. Although there has
not been a failure since, there have been
some absorptions. Many of the safeguards
incorporated in the Bank Act at present were
introduced as a result of information that
was made available in the study and investigation of the operations of the Home Bank.
In the last forty years only two bank charters have been granted. Like many others of
you I can only claim to have been present in

parliament on the occasion when one of them
was granted, which was last session.
Today eleven chartered banks are operating in Canada. At various times during the
period since Confederation the number has
been substantially larger. For instance, in
1890 there were 38.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How many charters are
there still in existence?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot tell you. The
mere fact that a charter is in existence does
not mean very much; but in order for a
charter to be effective the bank in question
must conform in its operations to all the
requirements of the Bank Act. As my honourable friend will recall, when we were considering the bill to incorporate the Mercantile Bank last session, one of the requirements
was that the bank had to have a paid-up
capital of not less than $500,000. That was
a condition that had to be met before that
bank could start operating. Many an institution that is born in a hurry or merely in
some person's imagination subsequently realizes the difficulty of getting enough money
So, if there are any
to start operations.
unused bank charters lying around at the
present time-and, frankly, I would be surprised to know that there are-they do not
present any problem, because the rules for
admission to the "Banking Society of Canada," as prescribed in the Bank Act, are
rather rigid.
Now, I would like to cite a few figures
indicating the successful operations of the
banks. I think that the system of branch
banks has been of great value in the development of Canada. We have today nearly four
thousand branch banks, penetrating into
every phase of industrial and agricultural
life in the country, and their earnings reflect
the developments in their respective areas.
These branches are like tentacles reaching
out into every part of Canada. Wherever
there is an actual or proposed development,
we find branches of banks offering their
services and facilities to the area, and assisting in that fashion in the development of
our economy. To that extent the banks in
the form in which they operate in Canada
provide, in my opinion, an excellent and
unsurpassed service.
Prior to 1900 most of the development in
Canada took place as a result of the loaning
facilities of banks. Since that time, of course,
investment banking has come to the fore and
large sums of money on a more or less
permanent basis have been poured into the
economy of Canada. That has led to the
great development which we have made over
the period since 1900. The banks, of course,
had their share in that. Up to 1944 the banks

SENATE
held a larger percentage of their resources
in securities in loans, but I think that today
the percentage of their resources in bank
loans is higher than the percentage in securities. In 1929, for instance, I think the total
of the loans by the banks amounted to $2-3
billion, and the gross national income at that
time was about $5-9 billion. In 1953 bank
loans amounted to over $4 billion, and the
gross national income was $24.2 billion. The
banks today have on deposit over $5 billion.
Those figures will give some idea of the
development which has taken place in banking facilities, and the development of the
banks themselves and of their ability to
assist Canadian industrial and agricultural
aperations.
After that preliminary statement I will now
get down to the bill which is before us. The
bill does not make many important changes
in the present Bank Act. I should say that
there are two principal changes so far as
the public are concerned. The first is the
change in the minimum cash reserves required
as a protection against Canadian dollar
deposits in the various banks of Canada. At
present the requirement for maintenance of
these cash reserves is on the basis of five per
cent of the total of the daily Canadian dollar
deposits. Under this bill when it becomes law,
the banks will have to maintain cash reserves
of not less than eight per cent of their monthly
average of Canadian dollar deposit liabilities,
and- in section 71 you will find the formula
spelled out for determining the cash reserves.
The minimum requirement is that each bank
must maintain eight per cent of its Canadian
dollar deposit liabilities as a cash reserve in
the form of a deposit with the Bank of Canada
and of Bank of Canada notes held by the
bank. A complementary provision in the
Bank of Canada Act, about which we shall be
hearing shortly, states that the Bank of
Canada may vary that requirement for cash
reserves from eight per cent to twelve per
cent.
That places a fairly strong weapon in the
hands of the Bank of Canada for controlling
the amount of cash available from time to
time for general banking purposes, because if
the Bank of Canada increases its requirements for the deposit of cash reserves, then
of course less money will be available for
loaning. Another way in which the Bank of
Canada may control the situation is by buying
and selling Canadian securities in the market.
If it wants to put more money for general
banking purposes into the market, the Bank
of Canada can do so by buying government
securities. If for some reason or other consistent with sound economy in Canada it
wants to reduce the amount of cash available,
it may then sell government securities. In

that event, of course, the cash used for this
purpose will lessen the amount available for
general banking purposes.
I am informed, by those who know, that
this requirement of even eight per cent will
not work any hardship on the banks, because
it is their usual practice to maintain a deposit
of about ten per cent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the Bank of Canada
control credit?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, the controlling of
credit develops in a different way. We had
an instance of that a couple of years ago
when, as a part of the anti-inflationary program, the Bank of Canada asked the various
banking institutions to exercise more control
over the credit which they were giving; and
then it made certain regulations to accomplish
that purpose. Some regulations also were
introduced by the banks themselves, not
handed down by the Bank of Canada. Apart
from the requirement as to cash reserves,
and the ability of the Bank of Canada to
influence, by buying and selling securities,
the amount of cash available in the market,
the Bank of Canada has little if any direct
control of the operations of banks. But at
that time, for purposes of general policy and
to combat anti-inflation, the banks established
in connection with their loaning policies certain rules, whereby a restriction was placed
upon the amount of money that was made
available.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before the honourable
senator leaves that point, will he tell us
whether the issue of $550 million which the
government sold the other day, and which I
call bankers' loans, may be used by the
banks for coverage purposes?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. My understanding
of the form in which the cash reserves are
required to be maintained is that they must
be deposited with the Bank of Canada, and
once determination has been made, under the
formula set out in section 71, of the amount
of average monthly cash reserves, those
reserves will be made up by cash deposits
with the Bank of Canada, plus notes of the
Bank of Canada which are held by the
various banks. The sub-total will equal the
amount of the cash reserves calculated under
the formula.
The other section which importantly affects
the public by extending to the banks the
power to loan money on improved real
estate, is one of which honourable senators
already have knowledge, because earlier this
session the Senate had occasion to deal with
the National Housing Act. We are familiar
with the provisions under which the banks
are enabled, if they so wish, to go into the

JUNE 3, 1954
business of loaning money on improved real
estate under some national housing program.
A loan approved by the National Housing
authority may be made by a bank, subject
to certain protective conditions. Transactions
so authorized may, I think, briefly be
described as the acquisition by banks of what
can be termed "insured mortgages". Maybe
I have a distorted sense of humour, but I
always supposed that an insured mortgage
is one which is insured to the extent of 100
per cent. I notice, however, in looking at
one of the returns which the banks are
required to make, in Schedule "M", at page
86 of the bill, the following item:
15. Mortgages and hypothecs insured under the
National Housing Act, 1954, less provision for
estimated loss.
So I repeat that, though my sense of humour
may be slightly perverted, it strikes me as
strange to talk about "insured mortgages"
and then require the banks to make returns
from time to time showing the amount of
these securities "less provision for estimated
loss". No doubt there is some explanation,
and we may expect to have it when we get
to the committee stage. In the meantime I
thought I should draw attention to the point.
I do not propose at this time to say anything about banks venturing into the improved real estate market, except to remark
that it taps a new and substantial source of
money for a solid national purpose, namely,
the provision of housing for large sections of
our population. Certainly in one sense an
expansion of the definition of "liquidity" is
required if we are to retain our old-fashioned
concept of a bank: for that concept, which
was incorporated in the Bank Act in 1871
and has persisted right down to today, was
that banks could not lend money on real
estate. But progress demands change. It may
be that the safeguards which surround the
investment by banks of money under the
National Housing Act of 1954 are sufficient,
and that the essential liquidity of the banks
will be maintained. It is my personal conviction that, in the light of the appreciation
which the government must have of today's
needs, and the objects which the banks and
the public hope will be realized through the
change, we have no need to feel too much
concern.
Under this bill the charters of all banks
will be extended another ten years. Coincidentally, I think I should point out, a sort
of safety provision appears for the first time.
By section 6, if parliament should not sit at
least twenty days in June, 1964, the Bank
Act, which is limited to ten years, and the
banks' right to operate, which is restricted
to the same period, will be automatically
extended until sixty days after the next

parliament convenes-that is, the parliament
which would meet in the following year.
The idea is that, if parliament will not be
sitting long enough in June 1964, when the
present bill will expire, there shall be an
automatic renewal for a limited period thereafter. That seems to me to be a wise precaution.
I should also point out that, by virtue of
section 75, subsection (2), there is a prohibition of any note issue by any bank.
I would also direct attention to section 82,
which extends the powers of the banks to
the making of loans for oil "in, under or
upon the ground". A definition of "hydrocarbons" is contained in the definition section. That definition, it will be observed,
is very broad, the design being, of course,
to assist in the development of the oil
resources of Canada-a project which had
not progressed sufficiently in 1944, the date
of the last revision, to require this provision
in the measure which was passed at that
time.
Let me also call attention to section 88, subsection (1). This is a clause which everybody
talks learnedly about. By an addition now
made to it the banks may lend money to
farmers for the purchase of seed potatoes.
This fact may astonish some people whose
occasional experiences with banks have led
them to feel that the provisions in this section must be extremely limited because they
could not borrow money. But I believe that
a reading of the provisions will convince
anybody that they are very broad indeed
and that the failure to borrow in any particular instance must have been due to the
fact that the bank was not then in a lending
mood.
I should like now to deal with an amendment that was introduced in the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the House of
Commons. I refer to section 75, subsection
(6) of the bill, which reads as follows:
(6) Paragraphs (b) and (d) of subsection (2) do
not apply to the lending of money or the making
of advances upon the security (whether by way of
mortgage, transfer or otherwise) of household
property, that is to say, motor vehicles and any
personal or moveable property for use in or about
dwellings and lands and buildings appurtenant
thereto, to any individual other than a manufacturer thereof or dealer therein, or to the purchase,
subject to a right of redemption, of such household
property from any such Individual.

That provision is broad in its application.
For instance, the United States federal housing authority, which makes housing loans in
a fashion similar to the housing loans made
under Canada's National Housing Act, contains a small loans improvements provision.
Recent investigations in that country have

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do the banks want this
provision?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can only say, as my
honourable friend has probably read, that one
bank strongly supports it.
I come now to a group of sections dealing
with the internal administration of banks.
I have already referred to one of these sections, section 6, which provides that if parliament sits on at least twenty days in June,
1964, the bank may carry on the business of
banking until July 1, 1964, and no longer;
and if parliament does not sit on at least
twenty days during June, 1964, the bank may
carry on its business until the sixtieth
sitting day of parliament next thereafter,
and no longer.
I should like to deal now with the requirements demanded of a bank desiring to
incorporate under the Bank Act as and when
the bill becomes law. Sections 10 to 13 provide for an increase in the minimum authorized and subscribed capital of a new bank.
At the present time a bank must have a
subscribed capital of $500,000 and a paid-up
capital of $250,000, whereas according to the
bill before the house a bank will have to have

me to wonder whether we are not just going

a thought I throw out and I am sure we can
explore this matter fully in committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I interrupt the honourable gentleman to ask a question at this
point?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It seems strange that the
banks refuse to lend money on motor cars,
in view of the fact that they do lend money
to finance companies which in turn advance
money against cars. Banks support small
finance companies all over Canada which
lend money for the purchse of cars. In other
words, the banks indirectly lend money on
motor cars. Has any consideration been given
to that fact?

JUNE 3. 1954
non-resident shareholders. The security laws
of some foreign countries are such that those
jurisdictions require the filing of a great
deal more information than is required here
in Canada. The committee of the other house
amended this section so that a bank, in
offering shares for sale, will not be obligated
in the same way when dealing with nonresident shareholders as when dealing with
resident shareholders. If there is some delay
with respect to an increase in capital from
countries outside Canada, that will not interfere with the proceedings for increasing the
capital in Canada. If non-resident shareholders ultimately do not exercise their rights,
there are provisions in the bill as to what is
to be done about the shares, and payment
to the non-resident shareholders.
Section 48 enables the banks for the first
time to establish by by-law the selection of
a method for transferring their shares. Heretofore, and down to the present time, a bank
was its own transferee and could not have
an outside transferee. I understand that the
reason for that was that when bank shareholders had a double liability the premise on
which the double liability was based was
that the banks had a liability both to their
depositors and to their noteholders, and
therefore anybody who dared to be a bank
shareholder assumed a double liability and
could be called on, in the event of a bank
failure, to pay 200 per cent of the value of
his shares. Even as late as 1923, when the
Home Bank falled, some of the sharebolders
were called on in this way. It will be seen
that as long as double liability prevailed the
greatest care had to be exercised in the
transfer of shares. But with the present
capital set-up there is no reason why banks
should differ from other companies in their
method of transferring shares.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does the bill provide that
the majority of shares held in Canada shall
be held by Canadians?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; but there is a provision that the majority of the Board of
Directors must be British subjects resident
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question?
Under the present practice, and I think
probably it is according to the law, banks
do not issue a stock certificate in the ordinary
sense of the term, as other corporations do;
and if a man owns bank stock he cannot
transfer it by simple endorsement. I cannot
see why that should be so. Does the bill
provide for that? I think bank stocks should
be transferable like corporation stocks or any
other stocks.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have not examined
the bill on that point, and I am not aware of
any provision which would treat bank share
certificates differently from those of any other
company; but I would say that if banks no
longer had any authority to issue notes
and there remained only their liability to
depositors, all reason for this close scrutiny
would be removed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask a question? Is
it not true that most companies require a
signature for the transfer of stock?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes; and an ordinary
power of attorney form may be used. On
the back of the certificate there is a space for
guarantee of the signature.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The bank enters your name
on its records and sends you a letter or
some form of certificate saying that you are
the owner of so many shares, but you cannot
transfer your stock by simple endorsement of
that document. I do not see why that should
be the case.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You cannot do that under
the present Bank Act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: By the change that is proposed, I understand, it is made optional, and
I do not see why it should be optional.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Whether it is optional or
not, I -am sure the banks will establish as
convenient a method as possible.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I understand that every
bank has a lien on the shares of its shareholders for any indebtedness they may incur
with the bank. Is that not the reason why
the banks do not issue certificates?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That provision is continued in this bill. If a person borrows money
from a bank, and is in default, the bank may
demand payment, and if the debtor is a
shareholder the bank has a lien on his
shares.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I think that is the
reason the banks -cannot issue share certificates which may ibe transferred by simple
endorsement.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I still maintain my view
that the substantial reason was the double
liability provision, because the other reason
will still exist.
Turning now to section 74, subsection (1)
reduces the length of time that banks are
required to keep old records. Under the
existing act the period is thirty years, but
the bill reduces this to twenty years.
May I now draw attention to section
75(2) (g), which provides for a change in the
restrictions on pension fund investments. At

SENATE
present there are fairly elaborate restrictions
on the investment of pension funds by banks,
and they are confined to trustee investments.
Apparently it has been left to managers of
pension funds to exercise their own discretion
in investing them, but the bill provides
that without the consent of the Treasury
Board the banks shall not contribute money
to any pension fund if any part of the fund
has been invested in bank shares. This provision guarantees to keep every bank pretty
effectively out of the business of marketing
any bank shares in its own pension fund or
that of other banks. If it were not for
this provision, it is conceivable that ultimately
one might wonder which bank had sold to the
other. Section 75(2) (g) simply says that the
bank shall not, directly or indirectly,
(g) except with the consent of the Treasury
Board, contribute to any guarantee or pension fund
if any part of the fund has, at any time after the
coming into force of this act, been invested in
shares of the capital stock of a bank.

I turn now to section 100 of the bill, which
makes provision for the amalgamation of two

or more banks.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Before the honourable
senator turns to another section, would he
tell us whether the provisions dealing with
loans to directors as set out in subsection
(3) of section 75, are in keeping with the
present law?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A comparison of this
provision in the bill with the act will indicate
some small change in the wording.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does this subsection
restrict the bank in its loans to directors
more than the present law does?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can answer my friend
very quickly by quoting the words of subsection (3):

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Even though the bank
shares have been sold?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If any shares come into
the pension fund after the passage of this
bill, from that point on the bank cannot
make a contribution to that fund without
the consent of the Treasury Board.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And that will be the
case for perhaps the next ten years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. Whether that is
intended and, if it is intended, whether it
should be so, is something that I would not
attempt to answer. It may be advisable to
have that provision spelled out to make its
meaning quite clear, and that is something
we can discuss in committee.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: As a matter of information, do I understand correctly that it is now
permissible for banks to invest pension funds
in any type of security, with the exception
of bank stocks?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Do you mean under the
existing law or under the bill?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Under the proposed new
law, are there any investment restrictions
apart from bank stock?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Under the present law
the bank is restricted in the type of investment it may make to securities in which
a trustee may invest under the Trust Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: And that will obtain
under the new legislation, will it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think so.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is there no restriction

this respect would permit two banks to
amalgamate, to become an entity, to be given
a name and operate under its own charter;
and the assets that before amalgamation
belonged to both organizations would become
the property of the newly amalgamated
bank. That overcomes the danger of the
application of that provision of the Income
Tax Act in relation to undistributed income.
In keeping with my policy in the past, I
should say rather that the section is intended
to overcome the effect of the provisions of
the Income Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But does it do that?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not saying whether
in my judgment it does or does not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Leave something to the
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I come next to section
109, which deals with unclaimed balances.
Under the present law, banks are required to
report unclaimed balances in their hands
which have accumulated over a period of
five years in which the depositors have not
been heard from. A good deal of work has
been involved each year in compiling and
submitting the necessary information. Section 94 requires, in any event, that at the
end of ten years all the unclaimed balances
must be paid over to the Bank of Canada.
The amendment to the existing law by section
109 requires the bank to report unclaimed
balances after nine years. In these circumstances, they would be reporting for only
one year; then they would pay the money
over and be rid of the unclaimed balances.
By and large, honourable senators, those
are the provisions in the bill which mark
changes in the present law, both in the relationship of the banks to the public and in
their internal administration. That does not
mean, of course, that there are not a great
many other changes in the various sections
of the bill, some of which are consequential
upon the making of the changes which I have
discussed with you, and some are a rewriting of the language making them more consistent with present-day company practice.
These details I do not feel are of sufficient
importance to discuss on the second reading
of the bill. For that reason, I have refrained
from mentioning all of the minute changes
and differences in the law which are incorporated in the bill. Those I have discussed
are, as I have said, substantial changes, and
having dealt with them, I have concluded the
task which I took upon myself today of explaining this bill on second reading.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would the honourable
senator answer one further question? What
became of unclaimed balances previous to
the regulations which compel the banks to
turn the moneys over to the Bank of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Of course the Bank of
Canada was set up in, I think, 1935.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: 1934.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Perhaps it started operations in 1935. Prior to that time my recollection is that the moneys went to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but I am not at all
clear on that-point.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
we all enjoy hearing the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) explain a
bill, and I must say that this afternoon I
have been a very attentive listener.
Of
course, his explanation and discussion of the
bill were entirely from a banker's point of
view. I would now like to make a few
remarks from the point of view of a customer
of the banks.
Honourable senators may remember that
ten years ago, when we were engaged in the
decennial revision of the Bank Act, I made
some remarks. While I will admit that I
have made some statements in this chamber
that I am not too proud of, I really am proud
of the statements I made on that occasion.
I am firmly convinced that they were of
immense value not only to western Canada,
but to every municipality, provincial government and, I am happy to say, to the banks
themselves. I complained of the banks' lack
of business ability, foresight and faith, if
you will, in western Canada. I criticized
them for some very unnecessary losses they
had incurred, and pointed out that some of
their creditors whom they had allowed to
settle for twenty-five cents on the dollar
were then embarrassing the banks with the
amount of cash they had on deposit, and I
quoted a few cases.
I suppose that when the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) calls on his
banker the discussion will not be along the
same lines as when I call on my banker.
I may say that for many years when I went
to see my banker it was for the purpose of
borrowing some money.
What I have to say today, honourable
senators, I hope will find its way into the
minds of the young men of this country. To
give background to my story, let me say that
I was a young man forty-eight years ago
when I arrived in western Canada with only
a dollar in my pocket and secured a job. From
that time on I certainly enjoyed handling a

SENATE
great deal of the banks' money, and even
encouraged the banks to break many banking
regulations in rendering me service.
I say to the young men of today that the
banking set-up, like many other institutions,
has to depend a great deal on human relations
between the managers and their customers.
Now, when you approach a bank manager, of
course money is generally the subject of conversation. I have had a bank manager slam
his books shut in front of me, with the advice
that my whole proposition was not a banking proposition and could not be considered,
but I did not get up and leave his office. I
was quite determined and I argued with him
that it was strictly banking business, that
banks were in business to lend money and I
was able to pay the interest. Of course, I
was told that there were some regulations that
the banks had to abide by. I insisted that
there must be some exceptions. I told him
how I had come out west with only a dollar in
my pocket, but if I got the money I would
see that it was repaid.
I remember a rather amusing incident concerning a bank, which occurred some fortyfive years ago when the railroad was being
pushed westward. As the honourable senator
who explained the bill this afternoon said, the
banks were right there to open a branch as
soon as there was a possibility of business and
a chance to render a service to the community, and I give them all credit for that.
The bank I refer to had sent a manager from
the city of Winnipeg to open a branch in the
new community. Of course, many of you
here have heard of the city of Winnipeg and
have an idea where it is located. Well, fortyfive years ago Winnipeg was "Baghdad-onthe-Rhine" so far as the western provinces
were concerned. It was the home of the grain
exchange, the packing plants, the livestock
market and so on. It can easily be seen that
a banker trained in Winnipeg should be quite
capable of managing the new branch; he had
only to inquire what racket his customer was
in to know whether it was a sure-fire business
and he was a good risk. However, when he
travelled five or six hundred miles further
west and came among people from all parts
of Canada and the world, he was in a somewhat different position. However, that was
the situation when I decided that instead of
borrowing money in the east, I would borrow
it in the west where I was going to live;
I wanted to start in right away to patronize
the bank which had moved in to accommodate
us. I spent one full day with this manager
arguing back and forth, quarrelling at times
over what I was asking him to do. He insisted that I borrow the money for only three
months and I countered by saying that I did

not have any chance in the world of repaying
the loan within that time, that I needed it for
at least a year. But the banker said no. He
took me out to lunch, and we talked further
about my business of shipping horses. He
wanted to know if I had ever been in the
United States. I could tell that the man was
greatly troubled. Finally I said that I had
thought of borrowing the money from him
just to patronize his bank, but if he could
not give me a loan I would get it elsewhere.
Two weeks later I received a letterI suppose as the result of his getting in touch
with his head office in Winnipeg-inviting me
to come and see him again, saying he would
be pleased to take up the matter once more.
I went back, and eventually I got a loan of
the money for a year. The interest was eight
per cent at that time and I told him to add
it on every three months, but that I would
not be able to pay it until the end of the
year.
Years later I heard another amusing story
about this fellow. It seems that he made a
good loan of $1,000 to a farmer, but he wrote
to head office explaining all about it. In turn
they began to question him as to why be
made this loan and asked for other pertinent
information. He became somewhat alarmed
and hired a livery team, drove out to this
farm and collected the money from the
farmer before he had any chance to use it.
He then wrote back to the head office and
said that the money had been repaid. The
head office gave him the deuce, and wanted
to know what this customer would think of
actions of that kind. But they were only trying to train him as a bank manager and they
were putting him through his paces. I have
found out that when a bank manager says
that something is not a banking proposition
he is only trying to get to know what kind of
a man he is dealing with; and if a young man
is uncertain and cannot put up an argument,
how can he expect the banker to trust him?
The whole thing boils down to a question of
human relations after all.
I was very much interested in the remarks
made by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) about the power to be
given to the banks to lend money on real
estate by taking mortgages on homes-under
a government guarantee, of course. When the
National Housing Bill was before us last
March I spoke on the character-building
value of owning one's own home, especially
in cases where people built their own homes
without government assistance. The Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
seemed to think he had squelched my argument by his remark that we have passed the
log cabin stage. I do not complain bitterly
of this retort, because one hears it so often.

JUNE 3, 1954
But there is one factor which he must have
overlooked. In thousands of years human
nature has not changed. I am not concerned
to deny the right of anyone, if he so wills,
to live in a palace: I am concerned with the
effects of some modern developments on
human character, because in any country the
quality of human character is of the highest importance. I hold in my hand an article
condensed from an address from Colonel
Charles A. Lindbergh, who in addition to his
other achievements is a successful author.
It is entitled "But How About Man?" He says:
Our scientific, economie and military accomplishments are rooted in the human quality which produces them. In the last analysis, al our knowledge, all our action, all our progress succeeds or
fails according to its effect on the human body,
mind and spirit.

That is what I am concerned about. What
are the effects on the spirit of man of all
this assistance, whether through guarantees
of loans, provision for housing, or other forms
of state aid? The short synopsis of Lindbergh's article concludes:
Until we realize in our bones as well as in our
brains that the character of man still forms the
essential core of a lasting civilization-

We shall not have found the right solution.
I firmly believe that we are getting too
much paternalism in the form of government
assistance. The question is not whether
materially or financially the country can
afford it, but what will be its effects upon
our people, and particularly the younger men
and women of this country. The problem,
as I see it, is a serious one.
Although I sincerely hope that the effects
of this bill will be beneficial, the basic question remains whether such assistance will
compensate for the unwillingness of young
men to work no more than five days a week.
I have worked eighteen hours a day, seven
days a week. The bankers knew my habits,
and when money was tight and credit restrictions were general, I could go to the
bank and get money because apparently the
banker knew that, for me, there was no
question of a five-day week; I was on the
job every day when my business needed
attention.
My message to young men is, do not be
discouraged. The man who has the right
spirit and the necessary resolution and is
willing to pay his debts will find that the
banking system is all right.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator who introduced this
bill has covered the ground so clearly and
so completely that there is not very much
left to say. As he has mentioned, the first
Bank Act was passed in 1871. That act prohibited the banks from loaning money on

the security of mortgages on personal or
immovable property, and that prohibition
was retained in every ten-year revision up
to the present time. Now, of course, banks
will be permitted to loan money under a
housing scheme and for the developing of
oil resources, in which my province of
Alberta is very rich. They are also permitted
to enter the small loan business and take
securities such as goods and merchandise.
The other chief change is in respect of cash
reserves of the banks with the Bank of
Canada, which reserves must now constitute
at least eight instead of five per cent of their
deposit liabilities.
The function of the chartered banks seems
to fall under two heads: first, to guard safely
the money which has been entrusted to them;
second, to make loans to industry. For these
purposes a branch bank system has been
set up, at tremendous cost. There are elaborate buildings-sometimes they seem to be
too elaborate-in almost every town and
city, and they are, of course, equipped with
burglar-proof vaults, time locks and all that
sort of thing. It must be admitted that our
branch bank system has proved to be successful, and that it is giving a great service
to the people. Interest is paid on savings;
accounts are very carefully kept; money is
always available when a depositor wants it;
and in recent years failures have very seldom
occurred. It has been said that sometimes
bank managers are pretty hard-boiled and
not too ready to make loans. But their
activities are carefully supervised by agents
of the government, by senior officers of their
own institutions, by shareholders, auditors,
and, especially, by the Bank of Canada. In
fact, as the system has evolved, not many
changes are desired at the present time.
As the last speaker may recall, at one time
elections in Western Canada were won by
making speeches. A resourceful candidate,
if he found his audience was getting restless,
would start to blame the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and if restlessness continued and
some people began to go out, he would turn
his attention to condemning the banking
system of Canada; and that would always
hold them. However, in a general way the
banking system has proved pretty satisfactory to the people of Canada. If the
amount of money in circulation is insufficient, we may expect hard times, unsaleable
surpluses, and unemployment. We all remember that during the '30s young men, and
occasionally young women, were riding on
freight trains, going east, going west, looking for work and unable to find it. Great
quantities of lumber and other building
materials accumulated, yet houses were not

SENATE
being built; goods on the shelves of merchants were unsaleable; and we shared in
a depression which was worldwide in extent.
We think now that the scarcity of money
had something to do with those hard times.
On the other hand, if there is too much
money in circulation it results in inflation:
prices soar, money loses its value, confidence
is shaken, and a condition may be reached
which was reached in European countries
when it took a wheelbarrow full of paper
money to buy a straw hat.
The most important work of the Bank of
Canada is to prevent wide fluctuations in
prices and in employment, as far as this is
possible, by monetary measures. To achieve
this goal, a high degree of skill, experience
and good judgment is required. In a general way, the amount of money in circulation
increases when bonds are purchased by the
bank, and the amount of money in circulation decreases when bonds are sold.
Varying discount rates and shifting government accounts may have a bearing on the
amount of money in circulation. This is all
part of the work of the Bank of Canada.
Let me make this observation. Prosperity
does not depend entirely on the amount of
money issued. Money is only a medium of
exchange. There must be production, export
trade, capital investment, and wide redistribution of wealth to support consumption
and maintain a reasonable standard of
prosperity. The velocity of circulation is
another big factor in the measure of
prosperity.

of Canada, has said that the government can

money is borrowed for a short time it is borrowed from chartered banks, and if it is

incomes the income tax in Canada is greater
than the income tax in the United Kingdom
or the United States, although on lower incomes the tax is smaller than it is in those
other countries. The fact is that income tax
in Canada bas reached a high level, amounting to 80 per cent on large incomes. It was
feared that the law of diminishing returns
would become evident, but thanks to the

business people of Canada this has not come
about. It can be said that Canadian business
has continued to expand. New ventures have
been undertaken despite the large proportion
of profits paid to the government; and where
losses have occurred they have been absorbed
by the enterprising individuals concerned.
Honourable senators, great changes have
been made as to the amount of money in
circulation. At page 1269 of the evidence
before the Banking and Commerce Committee
of the House of Commons it is reported that
some $2 billion of new money has been put
into circulation during the last eighteen years.
This new money has been issued by the Bank
of Canada for the purpose of facilitating
exchange and providing the purchasing
power required to absorb the vastly increased
production in this country. During that period
the cultivated acreage in Canada increased
from 13 million to 24 or 25 million. A
similar increase bas taken place in other
industries, such as in the pulp and paper

industry.
225,000 barrels of ail are pumped from
Alberta wells every day. In recent times
many changes have been taking place in
every line of human endeavour. Canada is
probably in a transition stage, and in the
province from which I come there is a large
number of money reformers.
The Honourable Lucien Maynard, Q.C.,
Attorney-General of Alberta, gave the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce of
the House of Commons an excellent summary
of the monetary policy in which he believes.
However, he was unable to persuade the
committee that money could be issued on
natural resources, on cultural heritage or any
of these vague things. He was unable to
induce the committee to adopt his proposed
amendments to the Bank of Canada Act. If
we are to do what is right, and if we wish
to progress, we must analyze and examine
these various schemes without prejudice and
in the light of the best knowledge this age
affords. If we find that these schemes would
bring about manifold blessings to the people
of Canada-happiness, security and a better
way of life-then they are worth living for
and fighting for; but if they would bring
about inflation or dictatorship we should do
what every other nation in the world bas
done-leave them alone.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator a question at this point? I do not
wish to interfere at all, but he mentioned
the Honourable Lucien Maynard, Attorney
General of Alberta, which province bas a
Social Credit government. British Columbia
now bas a Social Credit government too, and

explain, the officers of the Bank of Canada
Let us first consider the branch line
are charged with the responsibility of trying between Beattyville and St. Felicien. The

SENATE
schedule to the bill divides that branch into
three sections, from east to west-St. Felicien
to Lake Cache, 139 miles, at a cost of approximately $17 million; from Lake Cache to
Chibougamau, approximately 6 miles, at a
cost of $1 million; and from Lake Cache to
Beattyville, 149 miles, at a cost of $17
million.
The construction of these lines has been
under consideration for quite a long time.
The Turgeon Commission in its 1951 report
mentioned that an inquiry was then being
made by the C.N.R. to extend its lines to
that area. After an extensive examination
and several contacts with mine operators and
the lumber interests, the board of directors
of the C.N.R. seems to be satisfied that it
should be authorized to build the whole
section between now and 1964.
From Beattyville to Chibougamau, a distance of 155 miles, a geological survey showed
an extensive mineralization. Some mines are
already in operation, such as the Oppemiska
Copper Mines and the Campbell Chibougamau. These two companies are so heavily
interested in the construction of a branch line
that they have guaranteed a shipment of
325 tons a day of ore concentrates for a period
of six years. Should they not fulfil their
contract, they are heavily penalized by an
obligation to pay to the C.N.R. an amount
equal to one-third of the freight rate. At the
present time their shipments of ore to
Noranda by road and railway cost them $21
a ton. The new branch will permit a shipment at a reduced cost of $7 a ton.
The section between Beattyville and
Chibougamau will undoubtedly offer many
more opportunities to develop important mines
which will increase the shipments of ore and
develop very considerably this part of the
country. The same section is heavily timbered.
Approximately 30 million cords of pulpwood
would seem to be capable of sustaining a
yearly cut of over 600,000 cords. The Howard
Smith Paper Company, a large company,
operating in that section at the present time,
guarantees a shipment of 30,000 cords a year
for a period of 6 years. If it f ails to execute
its contract the company is obligated to pay to
the C.N.R. a penalty of $2 a cord for any
amount that it has failed to ship in the course
of any one year.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honourable senator if he knows what the average
cost per cord of transporting pulpwood
would be?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard:. I cannot tell you
exactly. At present, lumber shipped from
Beattyville to Chibougamau has to go by truck
to the Lake St. John section, which is a
considerable distance, and from there it is

shipped down to the St. Lawrence valley by
train; but when the line is built from Beattyville to Chibougamau all this lumber will be
shipped by train through Noranda to the
St. Lawrence valley, and this evidently would
be a much cheaper route. When I come
to discuss the construction of the other branch,
I shall point out in detail that it would be
impossible for the railway to compete with
floating operations. However, in that area
there can be no floating of wood by water,
because all the rivers flow towards Hudson
Bay. While I cannot answer the honourable
senator's question as to what the freight
rate would be, I think the arrangement must
be quite satisfactory, because the Howard
Smith Paper Company has undertaken to ship
at least 30,000 cords of pulpwood per year
for a period of six years.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: By freight?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: By freight. And if it
fails to fulfil that contract the company is
obligated to pay to the C.N.R. a penalty of $2
a cord for any quantity it f ails to ship in the
course of any one year.
Such commitments are sufficient to give the
Canadian National Railways in that first section of the branch from Beattyville to
Chibougamau an income sufficient to cover
interest on the borrowed money, the operation and maintenance of the line, and the
overhead, and provide a small margin of
profit.
In so far as the other section of the branch
is concerned, from Chibougamau to St.
Felicien, the situation is somewhat different.
A geological survey of that section indicates
no mineral and eliminates the possibility of
any mining development. However, this section also is heavily timbered and offers the
likelihood of a large cut of lumber and pulpwood. The Consolidated Paper Company
seems to be the main operator in this section;
but when it was approached and asked to
give commitments for transport of its timber,
it did not seem very interested. The reason
is simple: the lumber of that section is now
floated down to Lake St. John and the company refused to make any commitments to the
C.N.R. unless the railway would reduce the
established rates to the point where they
would be competitive with the cost of floating,
but the C.N.R. officials do not think they
can, with advantage, transport pulpwood and
lumber at such reduced rates. As I have said,
such a situation does not and cannot exist
in the section between Beattyville and
Chibougamau, because there the rivers flow
into the Hudson Bay.
It was therefore impossible for the Canadian National Railways to secure any commitments for that part of the branch line situated

JUNE
between Chibougamau and St. Felicien. However, it would certainly be advantageous to
connect the Abitibi section of the province of
Quebec with the Lake St. John section. The
Lake St. John district is heavily populated
and growing fast, with new and large industries. It is favoured with an outstanding
harbour which connects the Saguenay region
with the rest of the world. The authorities of
the railway feel that it would be an ideal
location for a copper or a nickel smelter, but
up to the present time they have failed to
find a great deal of interest in a branch line
on the part of those operating between
Chibougamau and St. Felicien. However, the
C.N.R. feels that new development may occur
at any time, and they hope someone will
decide to build a smelter. The immense
electric power potential of that region is certainly encouraging to anyone who would
build a smelter. In the circumstances the
railway has decided ta build first that section
of Une between Beattyville and Chibougamau where it has commitments which would
immediately put the line on a sound economic
basis, and it hopes the construction of the
other section of the line between Chibougamau and St. Felicien will be undertaken as
soon as that section can be visualized as a
sound economic proposition.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why does the railway
want the charter now?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Because new development may occur at any time which would
warrant the C.N.R. constructing that section
of the line. It is felt that within five or six
years, and maybe sooner, the line can be
built on a sound economic basis, and it would
only delay matters to have to apply again to
parliament for authorization to build it.
Mr. Fairweather, Vice-President of the
C.N.R., in his testimony before the House of
Commons committee, was most emphatic in
stating his belief that circumstances will be
such within the next few years as to warrant
giving immediate authorization for constructing the lines, so that when circumstances permit-and this may happen any day-the
C.N.R. can start construction of the second
section without delay. Every citizen of the
province of Quebec, especially those living in
the Chicoutimi district and in the city of
Quebec, hopes that the C.N.R. officials will
soon find circumstances favourable to the
building of the second section between Chibougamau and St. Felicien. The construction
of that section would give the northern part
of the province a needed outlet to the rest of
the world for the vast resources that undoubtedly lie in that part of the province.

Many people in the province of Quebecand I am one-are disappoined that the construction of the whole branch will not be
undertaken at once; we hope that early
future developments will convince the
C.N.R. authorities and the government of the
advisability of constructing the line from
Chibougamau to St. Felicien without delay,
and so connect a very rich district with the
Saguenay harbour, the city of Quebec, and
the rest of the world.
Huge sums of money have been spent in the
past for the construction of railway Unes in
Canada. The concern of the Canadian people
over the railway situation, I believe, led the
government to adopt its present policy of
building railway lines where they are necessary and able to bear the financial burden
accompanying them. Let me quote a paragraph from the Turgeon Commission report
of 1951:
The days of ill-conceived and therefore excessive
constructions seem ta have gone by, and our people
can feel reasonably assured that from now on no
railway venture will be undertaken excepting after
thorough investigation of such a project and
always with due regard ta the financial investments
involved.

May I now discuss some of the criticism
that has been made against the bill.
First: the total construction will be less
costly if it is completely undertaken at once.
The officials of the railway in their testimony
before the committee of the other house
stated that the construction between Beattyville and Chibougamau would take approximately two and a half years, but that if the
two branches were constructed at once it
would take four and a half years. That would
mean a delay of two years in the building
of that section on which the railways have
received commitments and promised rapid
construction. They stated furthermore that
whether the two sections were built at one
time or one after the other, the cost would
be the same. Further, to build the two sections at one time would involve the C.N.R.
in undertaking the immediate construction
of a line on which they have no commitments and which in the present circumstances they do not feel is justified.
Second: there is a feeling that the two
sections are not treated on an equal footing,
and the thought is advanced that material
could be transported on the ChibougamauSt. Felicien section to a greater extent even
than on the other section; some estimates
are as high as 500,000 tons a year. The
answer of the C.N.R. seems to me to be quite
reasonable. The railway would be quite
ready to start construction immediately if it
had commitments to the extent of 175,000
tons a year.

SENATE

Third: it has been pointed out that, not
very long ago, federal subsidies were granted
for the construction of railways where it
was considered uneconomic ta do so at that
time, but quite necessary for the development af the particular locality. It should not
be forgatten that such subsidies were
granted ta provincial railways. The Minister
ai Transport has emphatically stated that he
would be ready ta do the samne thing ta help
the construction of the Chibougamau-St.
Felicien section in the same circumstances.
The government, however, fails ta see why
in the present circumstances where the
C.N.R. has ta build, maintain and aperate a
line a long and well-established palicy should
be changed and the C.N.R. should build the
line, unless it is established that it will earn
a reasonable profit.
Fourth: it has been submitted that construction ai the Beattyville-Chibuugamau
section first would favour the province ai
Ontario and be ta the detriment ai the province ai Quebec. Such criticism seems ta me
completely unfounded and advanced merely
for palitical purposes. The whole branch
frorra Doazttyville ta Chibougamau is situated in the province of Quebec. It could

developrnent which bas already started. Al
this is in the provine of Quebec. The are
cancentrate wotild be shipped ta Noranda and
smeltcd in Noranda, an aperation tatally
situated in Quebec. The praduet would then
be shippe-1 irom Noranda ta a iactory in
Montreal East ta be converted inta a finished
product. Ail these operations are entirely
within the province ai Quebec, and I fail ta
see why sorne people stili advance the idea
that the C.N.R. or the government ai Canada
could passibly faveur Ontario rathcr than
Quebec. in sa far as lumber operations are
concerned, it could not conveivably grant
any advantage ta Ontario. The luniber is
cut in Quebec, it is ta be transported in
Quebec, worked in Quebec in Quebec milis,
and could not possibly be shipped ta any
other part af Canada in its raw state. A
provincial law requires that lumber and pulpwood cut on Quebec crawn lands-and that
is the case in this district-must be converted in milis located in the province ai
Quebec.
It might be advanced that the policy for
the present time is mare advantageaus t
Noranda and the Abitibi section af the province ai Quebec than ta the Saguenay district.
Hawever, in each case the advantage seems
ta be totally favaurable ta the province ai
Quebec. It would be pretty hard for the

province of Quebec ta get more than 100
per cent of the advantages accruing, whether
they accrue ta one section or another af the
province af Quebec. Furthermore, there are
already negotiations between the mine
operators and the Noranda smelter, and the
construction af the rallway between Chibougamau and St. Felicien wauld nlot in any
way change the shipping af this concentrate
ta Noranda.
In sa far as lumber is concerned, the
Howard Smith Company, whether the railway
is constructed ta St. Felicien or not, will
continue ta ship ta its milis in Quebec. The
Consolidated Paper Company, operating in
the section between Chibougamau and St.
Felicien will continue ta float its lumber ta
Lake St. John, and the construction af the
railway ta St. Felicien wauld only permit
such shipments ta be possibly less costly ta
the Cansolidated Paper Company withaut any
advantage ta the Lake St. Jahn section and
would only mean a financial burden imposed
upon the shoulders af the Canadian people.
It is feared by the Lake St. John peaple
that a delay in the construction af the ChiL-ougcamau-St. Felicien section might adversely
affect the possible construction af a smelter
in the Saguenay region. Mr. Fairweather, a
Vice-Fresident af the C.N.R. and a very
strong proponent of locating a smelter in the
Saguenay region, stated before a standing
committee af the House of Commons that
the C.N.R. had made several approaches ta
see if there was a possibility of any interest
in such a project. He has made the policy of
jhe C.N.R. very clear in stating that the
C.N.R. will immediately' start construction
af the railway in the Chibougamau-St.
Felicien section should anyane respansible
decide ta build a smnelter in the Saguenay
region.
Han. Mr. Reid: What committee was it
that Mr. Fairweather appeared before?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The House of Commens Standing Committee on Railways,
Canais and Telegraph Lines. His evidence on
this matter before that committee lasted a
full day, and a report of the meeting is
available ta members of the Senate. According ta his statement, the construction of the
smelter would take three years, while it
would only take twa and a half years ta
build the railway
Let us hope that the large interests
cancerned with the develapment of the
Saguenay region will before long see their
way clear ta give the C.N.R. the necýessary
commitments ta make it certain that the
branch line could be constructed on an economic basis, or that the great resources of
the regian will soon induce large financial

JUNE 3, 1954
interests to build a smelter in the Saguenay
region and that the construction of the branch
from Chibougamnau to St. Felicien wi'll soon
become a reality. Such transportation facilities between the Abitibi and the Lake St.
John district with its large power resources,
its magnificent harbour and its progressive
population, are certainly very desirable.
In so far as the Hillsport to Manitouwadge
Lake section is concerned, there is no difficulty. Some very important copper, zinc and
silver mines have been discovered there
and it is already proposed to put them in
operation. Large amounts of concentrates
will have to be transported and the quantity
will be more than sufficient to assure
the C.N.R. an efficient and remunerative
operation.

CRERAR

FELICITATIONS ON CONFERMENT
DOCTORATE OF LAWS

OF

On the Orders of the day:

Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, in
view of the large volume of legislation that
we have to deal with, I hesitate to bring up
a matter which really bas nothing to do with
our work, but before the Orders of the Day

are proceeded with I should like to draw
the attention of the Senate to an honour
which has recently been accorded one of our
most distinguished members.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Mr.

Euler:

Honourable

members

know that I refer to my deskmate, friend
and colleague of many years standing, the
Honourable Dr. Thomas Alexander Crerarbetter and more popularly, and I think I
may say affectionately, known as Tom Crerar.
All too often in this chamber, as occasion
arises, when we hear tributes paid to those
who have gone to another place-and let me
say that I do not mean the House of Commons-we hear of qualities and accomplishments of departed members of which we
were not aware. I would like to continue
that practice in reverse, as it were, and pay
tribute to a man who is still very active in

JUNE
the Senate and who we hope will continue
so for many years. The degree of Doctor of
Laws which has been conferred upon Senator Crerar is well deserved, and the University of Manitoba, in honouring our colleague,
bas honoured itself. Through his long years
of public service Senator Crerar has truly
become a man of distinction; and when I
use that phrase it is entirely coincidental,
for no one should assume that I am trying
to associate him with a certain beverage
which seems to be the favourite of so many
who are advertised as "men of distinction".
Nor will anyone, I think, take offence when
I refer to the fact that in reporting the
occasion when the distinction was conferred
upon him he was described by a certain
prominent newspaper-I think of Liberal
tendencies also-as the Progressive Conservative senator from Winnipeg.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Ross: Do you suggest that he
should cross the floor of the house?
Hon. Mr. Euler: We already have a genuine
dyed-in-the-wool Progressive Conservative
senator from Winnipeg, who I am sure would
not object to sharing that distinction with
my friend, especially if he could hope for
such a notable accession to the ranks of his
party. In fact, I have heard it suggested that
my friend should be offered a vacant seat on
the other side next to the senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis); and as I
can understand he might be sorely tempted
by such an offer, I am glad to have his
assurance that he intends to continue to
occupy the seat at my side.
The honourable senator and I entered the
House of Commons together after the elections of 1917. Perhaps I should say, not
that we entered the house together, but that
we entered the house at the same time, because he came in as a supporter of-and in
fact as Minister of Agriculture in-the Union
Government of 1917, while I came in as a
supporter of the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
When the war ended, Senator Crerar-the
Honourable Mr. Crerar as he then waswithdrew from that government. Not so
very long after that he became the leader of
the Progressive Party. So the newspaper was
at least half right when it described him as
a Progressive Conservative. He was, as I
say, the head of that party, and in the
ensuing election he came measurably close
to becoming Prime Minister of Canada, a
position which I think he would have held
with credit. Later he joined the King government, and it was at that time that I formed
of him the high opinion which I have never
83280-35

had reason to alter, and which has been
enhanced by all my later association with
him.
In my opinion Senator Crerar has among
others two outstanding characteristics. One
is his great love of freedom from any unnecessary restrictions, which quality has been pinpointed by his devotion to the policy of free
trade; and the other is his fine quality of
integrity-not merely that type of integrity
which is ascribed to people who are honest
in every-day dealings, but that integrity of
mind and character which would never allow
him to support anything in which he did
not believe. When Tom Crerar believes in
a thing he is willing to fight for it, and what
he fights for he believes in.
I know my friend is a modest man, so I
do not think his head will be turned when
I say in his presence that to me he is the
embodiment of what a senator ought to be.
He has had vast experience, not only in
business but in public affairs, and he has
maturity of judgment, and a combination of
the two makes for wisdom. He bas courage,
tolerance, and the ability to express himself
clearly; and as a result, he bas the ear of the
house and its undivided attention whenever
he speaks.
Perhaps at this point I might let honourable
senators in on a secret. The whip on this side
of the house (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) entrusted
me with the task-more or less because I
am the deskmate of the senator from Churchill
-of urging my friend to express his views
on any important matters before the house.
I leave it to the house to say whether or not.
I have been successful in that task-althought
I must admit that it bas not been a very difficult one.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like also to speak
of the independence of thought and action of
the senator from Churchill. He is at times
critical of measures that come from the government, but not hypercritical. What he says
is by way of objective criticism and is said
with only the interests of the country at
heart.
Perhaps I should not mention this, but we
have of late heard a great deal of criticism
of the Senate, some of which bas come from
another place and some from the press. Part
of that criticism I agree with, and part is
very ill-founded. For instance, a great publication which calls itself a national newspaper carried an editorial the other day in
which it was stated that the Senate is in
disrepute and in a state of ridicule. That I
think is utterly unfair, unjust and untrue.
But perhaps we could deal with that criticism

SENATE
in much the way a burly old workman accepted the treatment his wife gave him from the
business end of a broom. One of his friends
asked him why he allowed the little woman to
beat him up in the way she did. His reply
was "Well, it pleases she and it don't hurt I".
We have also been hearing suggestions for
reform of the Senate. I hope His Honour the
Speaker will not call me to order if I make
just a few remarks with regard to that. Some
newspapers, and others I will not designate,
want the Senate abolished altogether. I am
not going to comment on that except to say
that I think it will be many a day before that
takes place. Indeed, I doubt whether the
people of Canada want the Senate abolished,
no matter what its role may be or how it may
be constituted. Others want to make the
Senate elective, and I think it would be very
difficult to make an argument in a democratic
country against that suggestion. Others want
to have the method of appointment changed.
Well, there has never been any unanimity as
to what the form or method of appointment
should take. Some others would actually like
to prohibit appointment of men who are
seventy-five years of age or more. Needless
to say, I think that is rather unimportant.
Perhaps some might expect me to be opposed
to that, but I am not, As I have said before
in this chamber, I believe that Senate reform
could come from within, and that it would
come about if we carried out the purpose for
which the Senate was established-if we made
the Senate a chamber of sober second thought,
as it is usually spoken of; and if, when senators dealt with the matters that came before
them they did so objectively and with only
one thought, to serve the best interests of the
country. I think my friend from Churchill
qualifies in that respect just about as well
as anyone. Party politics, for the sake merely
of party, should have no place in our deliberations.
I apologize for speaking at such length in
congratulating my friend (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
upon the honour which has been conferred
upon him. I salute him because he deserves
it and I know I have the unanimous support
of every member when I say to him that we
wish him and his wife many years of good
health and happiness, and hope that in the
years to come he will be just as useful to the
Senate and to the people of Canada as he has
been in the past.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I too wish to congratulate the honourable
member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) on
the honour that he has received, and also to
congratulate the honourable member from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) on his very

appropriate remarks. The other day when I
received a copy of the Winnipeg Free Press
I was, as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in this house, quite disturbed
to read in that very efficient newspaper that
the senator from Churchill had been elected
to membership in the Progressive Conservative party. I cannot account for that report
except in this way: that for many years the
honourable gentleman has been an ardent
free-trader, and the young men who reported
the event thought that therefore he could not
be a supporter of the present government,
and as it was necessary to place him in some
party the reporter went the whole hog and
described him as a member of the Progressive
Conservative party.
Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Haig: As soon as that "news"
broke I found myself in difficulty right away,
because the honourable member from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), the Government
Whip, immediately consulted with the Whip
on this side of the house (Hon. Mr. Quinn) to
arrange to have the senator from Churchill
seated with opposition members. It was
suggested that he be given a seat alongside
the honourable member from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), but next day, when she
heard of it, she fainted, and she has been
in the hospital ever since. I do not know
why the Government Whip should have done
this to the Progressive Conservative party.
It is true that there are not many of us, and
I am not sure he did not suggest to the
Free Press reporter that the senator from
Churchill might be willing to join our party.
If he did, he was half-right: the honourable
senator is progressive, but whether he is a
Conservative or not I sometimes doubt.
The honourable senator is typical of many
men and women born in some other province
who came to Manitoba in their early lives
and received their education and training and
experience there. He shares the record of
many public men and, I say quite candidly,
some of the most distinguished people in our
province, in that, born on a farm, he drifted
into the profession of school-teaching, then
became a farmer, and ultimately engaged in
business in Winnipeg. There he became the
promoter, founder and establisher of one of
the largest voluntary grain-trading companies
in the West, and, indeed in all Canada-a
company which has given outstanding service,
especially to the farmers of my province. It
was a source of great happiness to me and
to other Manitobans who knew him as a
young man to observe his successful establishment of the Grain Growers Grain Company, later known as the United Grain
Growers. That company is one of the outstanding organizations of its kind in respect

JUNE 8, 1954
of not only elevator operation but of grain
handling. Knowing of the good will he
enjoyed among the members of that great
enterprise-he and I occupied offices in the
same building for many years-I was never
able to understand why he left the business
and went into politics. The only conclusion
I could ever come to-an opinion which has
been confirmed from my association with him
here for some years-is that, loving this
country so well and knowing its greatness and
its possibilities, he felt that he could give
even greater service to Canada as a minister
of the crown or a member of the federal
parliament than as the head of a great trading
corporation. I am able, perhaps better than
anyone else in this house, to appreciate the
motives which led him to join the Union
Government, and the perplexities he had to
overcome before be made his decision.
The University of Manitoba, of which my
colleague from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
and I have the honour of being graduates,
bas always been careful, in its awards of
doctorates and other academie titles, to select
men and women truly representative of what
Manitoba prizes most, a quality which may
be described as, above anything else, straightforwardness, candour in political life. It is
this characteristic which the university
recognized in conferring upon him a doctor's
degree. Like the people of Manitoba, the
university's committee of selection felt that
the name of Tom Crerar should be inscribed
on the university standard, in the hope that
young people, when about to enter upon their
life's work, might be drawn to follow his
example.
For me, this is a very happy moment, in
that I, who graduated from Manitoba University some fifty-three years ago, have the
privilege of standing here and telling him
I am delighted that he has been given the
honorary degree of LL.D. I know I speak
for Manitobans generally as well as myself
in voicing our pride in this man whom
Manitoba sent out to take part in world
aff airs.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to add a word?
I agree entirely with all the complimentary
remarks which have been made about our
good friend the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar)-although, in saying "complimentary remarks", I am not so sure that the
terrn can be applied to his reported membership in the Progressive Conservative party.
In this connection may I say that our Whip
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) did not consult me
when he considered moving the honourable
senator from this side to the other. I would

have opposed the change most heartily. I
sat for quite a number of years in the House
of Commons with the senator from Churchill.
I learned to admire him there, and my
admiration of him has continued since I came
to this chamber. I look upon him, not as a
Progressive Conservative, but as a loyal and
true Liberal. I appreciate the co-operation
which he has given me at all times since I
have been in this house. It is true that he
has not always agreed with the legislation
which has come forward, but whenever he
has objected it has been because he believed
his stand to be in the best interests of the
country.
As Leader of the Government in this house,
and as a member of the government, I want
to join the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) and the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) in congratulating the
senator from Churchill; and may I express
the wish that he will be with us for many
years, so that for a long while to come we
shall have the choice of addressing him
either as "Tom, Senator" or "Doctor Crerar".
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
for me this is a rather novel and somewhat
difficult experience. I am more than deeply
grateful for all the kind words that have
been said about me by my colleague the
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), by
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). May I thank you all for the
generous manner in which you have received
what they have said?
To be quite frank, I am not conscious that
I am a bit different today from what I was
when I was here seven or eight weeks ago.
I deeply appreciate the honour which the
University of my adopted province of Manitoba-the province in which I have lived
now for more than seventy years-has seen
fit to confer upon me. I can say quite sincerely I do not yet know why this honour
sbould have come to me-there is no false
modesty in my saying this-but I did accept
it with a feeling of pride.
May I offer just a few comments about
the nice words that have been said about me
here today? My colleague from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) was altogether too generous.
All I can claim is that in my experience in
public life I have sought always to do what
I thought was right, but looking back over
the years I may say that sometimes the mistakes that have been made are the things
that stand out with rather appalling significance. As my friend from Waterloo has
said, we came into parliament at the same

SENATE

country. We are living in a world of change
today, a world where all the old values are
being challenged, a world that is dominated
too greatly by purely materialistic considerations. I have endeavoured always and I
shall always endeavour to emphasize that the
great human heritage and truths we possess
are those which link with the spiritual and
moral well-being of mankind. That is why I
have always advocated my believe in freedom.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I believe most of us are taken by surprise with this very good news. If the fame
of the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchil) had been carried
as far afield as that of the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), and if
he had served in parliament as long, we
could have made many complimentary remarks about him as well. We are all very
happy to learn that he has received the
degree of Doctor of Civil Law, for he bas
earned it by years of faithful service, not only
in this house, but elsewhere. I am sure that
we all join with the honourable senator from
Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) in wishing our colleague many years to enjoy the
honour conferred upon him, which he so
richly deserves.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, if
the senator from Northumberland who has
received this well-merited honour would
become a Progressive Conservative, and if
he had a good publicity agent, he would be
an acquisition to the opposition.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I will not delay the proceedings here, but

kindly and generously of me.
WHEAT PRICES
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
wish to direct a question to the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). A
statement appeared in the press yesterday
evening to the effect that the Canadian
Wheat Board had agreed to reduce the selling price of wheat for export by about 10
cents per bushel. May I ask if wheat will be
available to the domestic consumer at the
same reduced price?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information that would enable me to answer my
honourable friend's question, but my recollection is that the price quoted is for sale
of wheat for export. I do not think the price
of wheat for sale in Canada will be affected.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is what I was
afraid of.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gray Turgeon moved the second
reading of Bill 464, an Act to amend the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.

He said: Honourable senators, to be asked
to sponsor a bill of any nature affecting the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police is naturally
intriguing to many of us here who come
from or have lived for some length of time
in western Canada. Many of us can look
back to the early days when this body was
called the Northwest Mounted Police, and
when, later, in 1904, it was called the Royal
Northwest Mounted Police. After 1920 its
jurisdiction was extended into eastern provinces and its name became changed to the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Everyone
in Canada realizes the great debt that our
people owe to the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, because its organization has been one
of the major factors in establishing a great
reputation for Canada and Canadians, not
only on the American continent, but throughout the world.
This bill proposes only two amendments
to the act. I think the best way for me to
sponsor the bill is simply to make what
might be called an official statement as to
its objectives.
Dealing with the first amendment, it
should be noted that in 1932 provision was
made for the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner. Since that time the strength and
responsibilities of this law-enforcement body
resulted in an overwhelming amount of work
for the person filling that office, and accordingly by order in council dated March 26,
1953 there was appointed a Senior Assistant
Commissioner, who receives the same rate
of pay as the Deputy Commissioner of the
Force and holds equal responsibilities. The
purpose of this amendment is to round out
the act so that it will be possible to have
two officers classified as Deputy Commissioners. There will also be one or more
Assistant Commissioners, although none of
them will be designated, as in the past, as
Senior Assistant Commissioner.
I will leave the legal interpretation for a
moment and point out that the terms of this
first amendment are already being carried out
by authority of an order in council, so there
will therefore be no additional expense if
the amendment is passed and becomes part
of the existing act.
The second change being made at this
time is with respect to the pension scheme at
present in effect for members of the force.
Parts 2 and 3 of the act set out the original
non-contributory pension scheme for which
all members of the force had been eligible
until 1949. In that year a new contributory
pension scheme was begun and made available to all members coming on the force after
that date, as well as to those already on the
force. Thé advantage of it lay in special features such as allowances to widows and

SENATE
children of the members, and other benefits
not available under the previous noncontributory pension scheme.
This new scheme contains special provision
whereby members of the force discharged for
inefficiency or misconduct might receive a
reduced pension and not be left entirely destitute after their service to the country. In
effect, it would mean that persons having
over ten years of service and who are discharged for inefficiency or misconduct might
become entitled to a pension in the amount of
one-half of the disability pension which would
be ordinarily paid to them on retirement until
the age of 65 and then two-thirds of such
pension after that age. This measure, of
course, would require an investigation by a
Royal Canadian Pension Board, together with
a recommendation to the minister that it
would be in the public interest to grant such
a pension in recognition of good and faithful
service rendered by the contributor prior to
such misconduct or inefficiency. The minister
would, in turn, recommend it to the Treasury
Board, and upon receiving a favourable report
the Governor General in Council might grant
the pension. Authority is also given to increase the amount to two-thirds of such disability until 65, and to a full pension after 65,
according to the circumstances of dismissal
through inefficiency or misconduct.
The effect, then, of the legislation is to
make such pension provision for members of
the force retired for inefficiency or misconduct
applicable to those coming under the noncontributory pension scheme set forth in Parts
II and III of the act as well as to those participating in the contributory pension scheme
under Part V of the act.
Honourable senators, I have a strong desire
to see this bill passed and added to the existing act. I understand that at present only
seven men would be affected by this pension
scheme for members of the force discharged
for inefficiency or misconduct. I also understand that in so far as the misconduct is concerned, nothing in the bill would affect the
reputation of a person so discharged, as the
type of misconduct in question is such as
might occur among people occupied in any
grade of work.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I overheard the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) say that he
would like the bill to be referred to a committee.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
would like the bill to go to committee because
I do not like the word "misconduct" which is
used. Recently there came to my attention
the case of a man who had been accused of
misconduct under the act. I am not criticising
the government in power at the time or the
minister, but actually this man had merely
failed to carry out some regulation. I do not
think a man should be deprived of his pension
for that.
During my term as a member of the Manitoba legislature I voted against putting the
R.C.M.P. in control of police work in that
province, but the majority voted against me
in favour of it, and the mounted police were
put in charge of law enforcement of both
provincial and federal laws in that province.
Afterwards, I admitted that although I did not
like it, the government of the day was right
and I was wrong.
I strongly urge that this bill be referred to
a committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
BANK OF CANADA BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 297, an Act to amend the
Bank of Canada Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
to amend the Bank of Canada Act. The bank
bas been in existence for close to twenty
years, having opened its doors in March 1935.
This is the first important amendment to
the Bank of Canada Act since the year 1936,
and it occurred to me that it afforded an
opportunity to recall the origin of the Bank
of Canada and to review its functions, as
a preamble to the discussion of the bill itself.
I must admit that I have prepared my
remarks along those lines, and have found
that the preamble is very much longer than
the explanation of the bill, for which I must
apologize to my honourable friends.
There is, I think, a general ignorance of
the methods by which the Bank of Canada
operates and the effects which it bas on the
economic life of the country. That is an
ignorance which I shared, at least until I
began a study of this bill. It involves questions relating to the theory and practice of
central banking, and these are tied up with
all kinds of economic theories and problems
which are difficult for the average man to
understand. I am quite certain there are a
number of members of this bouse who know
a great deal more about these matters than
I do; to them I apologize if the remarks I
am about to make appear elementary or even

JUNE 8, 1954
rudimentary. On the other hand, there may
be some members of the house whose knowledge of this subject is as vague and sketchy
as my own has been; if so, it is to them that
I will address the first part of my remarks.
The Bank of Canada came into being as
a result of the report of the Macmillan Commission in 1933. That commission, appointed
by the Bennett government, was headed by
Lord Macmillan, a very distinguished member of the judicial committee of the British
Privy Council, who in 1929 had headed a
previous commission which presented a famous report on economic conditions in Great
Britain. The' other members of the Canadian Macmillan Commission, if I may so call
it, appointed in 1933, were a number of
prominent Canadian bankers and business
men. Early in 1934 the commission presented its report, following which the Bank
of Canada bill was introduced in parliament,
early in the session of 1934, and became law
in the course of that year. The Bank of
Canada opened its doors on March 11, 1935.
I am sure a great deal of credit is due to
the government of Mr. Bennett, and to Mr.
Bennett himself, for the introduction of that
legislation; and I think I should couple the
name of Mr. Bennett in the legislative sphere
with the name of a very distinguished public
servant in the civil service sphere whom he
induced to enter the public service of this
country, the man who I think beyond all
others was responsible for the actual mechanics by which the Bank of Canada was
set up. I refer of course to the late Dr.
Clifford Clark, who for so many years was
Deputy Minister of Finance.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The Macmillan Commission lays down on page 63 of its report
the basic purpose for which it recommended
the establishment of a central bank for Canada. Let me quote a few words from that
report:
. .

. the central bank . .

national monetary unit and to mitigate by its
Influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade, prices and employment, so far as
may be possible within the scope of monetary
action, and generally to promote the economic and
financial welfare of the Dominion: Therefore
et cetera.
Honourable senators, I should like to
emphasize three parts of that preamble. First,
the central bank is expected to regulate
credit and currency; secondly, it is expected
that it will mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade,
prices and unemployment; and thirdly, I
direct attention to the rather important words
of qualification which say "so far as may be
possible within the scope of monetary action".
These last few words, which I should like to
discuss for a moment, point the finger to a
very important truth-a truth to which my
honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) referred in his able speech of last
Thursday on the introduction of the Bank
Bill-that monetary policy by itself is no
magic cure-all for economie ills. The central
bank cannot, by and of itself, guarantee continuous prosperity; and that for the reason,
as the senator from Toronto pointed out,
that there are many other factors which may
be involved, such as the fiscal policy of the
country as regards such things as tariffs, the
international situation as it may exist at any
given moment, and the state of international
trade.
The international trade picture is of particular importance to a country like Canada
which exports to foreign markets about 25
to 30 per cent of her annual production.
Almost more important still than those factors
to which I have referred is the human element. When I was a student at the university, receiving lectures in economics from
Dr. Stephen Leacock and others, I was
taught about that rather mythical concept
called "the economic man", whose entire
activities were directed by economic motives

and whose whole aim and ambition was
economic in the sense that every step he took
was for his own economic advancement. Now,
the economic man is, as I say, largely a
mythical animal. But I think it can be said
that if mankind, in all its actions, were
governed solely by what it considered to be
in its material interest, and by no other considerations, the task of the economist would

SENATE
feelings, their beliefs, their passions and
prejudices lead them into a course of action
which differs greatly from that which they
would follow if they were motivated simply
by economie purposes.
Let me give a striking example of that.
Look at the situation that exists in India,
the Indian Empire as we used to know it
under the British regime. India today, in its
present political shape, is what I think can
with justification be called an economist's
nightmare. By every rule of economic
geography it should be one country, and one
state should rule the whole area between the
Himalayan Mountains and the Indian Ocean.
But, for religious and racial reasons, the
country is divided into three separate segments: the middle segment constitutes the
present state of India, or Hindustan, which
divides the other two segments, separated
from one another by a thousand miles, and
forming the present state of Pakistan. As I
say, from an economic point of view, it is a
nightmare.
Now perhaps you will say to me that
consideration of the geographical situation of
India is very far removed from the consideration of amendments to the Bank of Canada
Act, and I would perhaps be disposed to agree
with you, but I did mention this matter
merely as an illustration of the truth which
is foreshadowed in those words in the preamble of the Bank Act, the truth that monetary
action by itself, acting alone, cannot be
expected to answer all our national economic
problems.
Now, I want to consider those two other
parts of the preamble to the act which I
mentioned a moment or two ago. These are
the duties of the Bank of Canada: firstly, to
regulate credit and currency, and secondly, to
mitigate fluctuations in the general level of
trade and production.
I would like for a few minutes to discuss
these functions of the Bank of Canada and
the way in which it carries them out. I think
perhaps the best way to start that discussion
will be to consider the tools with which the
bank is provided in order to carry out the
job which it is supposed to do, and that
involves us in a consideration of the bank's
balance sheet. I hold in my hand a copy of
the balance sheet of the Bank of Canada as
at December 31, 1953. Let us consider first of
all the liability side, its liabilities being the
capital which it has obtained in various
ways in order to acquire the assets which are
shown on the opposite, the asset, side of the
balance sheet, which I will discuss in a few
moments. The principal items on the liability
side of the balance sheet are, first, its capital
of $5 million, represented by shares, all of
which are held by the Minister of Finance

on behalf of the people of Canada, and the
Rest Fund of $10 million which has been
accumulated during the years out of reserves
from profits, making $15 million in all. Now,
$15 million may seem like a good deal of
money to you and me, but it is not a very
large item in the balance sheet of the Bank
of Canada. Incidentally, the provisions of the
Bank of Canada Act with regard to the Rest
Fund are being amended in the bill now
before us and on which I shall have a few
words to say in a few minutes.
The second item of the liabilities on the
Bank of Canada balance sheet is Notes in
Circulation, $1,599 million odd-say $1,600
million in round figures. That figure represents the total amount of bank notes of all
denominations which are in the hands of the
people of Canada and are used for their day
to day transactions across the counter in
which cash passes from hand to hand. The
whole of the bank notes of the country are
now issued by the Bank of Canada under the
provisions of the Bank of Canada Act. As
honourable senators will remember, prior to
1935 each of the chartered banks had the
privilege of issuing its own notes and. it did
issue its own bank notes in denominations of
$5 and multiples of $5 while, for notes of
smaller denominations, the Dominion government itself issued notes of $1 and $2 denommations which were a direct liability of the
Dominion government. Since 1935 the Bank
of Canada alone has had the right to issue
bank notes. The other notes which were outstanding have gradually been withdrawn and
few, if any, actually are in existence at the
present time. Some of them may be in the
hands of collectors.
As I say, bank notes are the medium by
which the people of the country carry on
their day to day transactions by which cash
is required to pass from hand to hand, and
it is the responsibliity of the Bank of Canada
to see that there are enough bank notes
always available to meet the requirements of
the trade and commerce of the country. These
requirements, of course, vary. In a period of
business activity, and when the price level
is increasing, naturally, the number of notes
required tends to expand, and vice versa.
Also of course, there are seasonal variations
in the requirements of the people of Canada
for bank notes. It is a common experience
that during the fall months when the western
crop is being sold and the Christmas trade is
active, the people of Canada need a good
many more bank notes than they do later
on, so that the bank note issue tends to
increase at the end of the year and to drop
again during the months of January and
February. Now, in spite of this enormous

JUNE 8, 1954
sum of $1,600 million of bank notes outstanding, I must say that the total of outstanding bank notes in Canada in circulation
is not a very important factor when you
consider the total credit and the total economic activity of the country. Let me give
you an example or two of that.
On the 31st of December last we had
$1,600 million of bank notes outstanding. On
the same date the chartered banks had loans
outstanding to people in Canada of $4,000
million, more than 2j times the amount of
notes outstanding, while the deposits of the
people of Canada in their banks totalled
$5,000 million. Take another example. In
the year 1953 the gross national product of
the country, as estimated by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics-that is, the total value
of ail the wealth produced by Canada in
1953-was $24,000 million, which is more
than 15 times the amount of bank notes that
were actually in circulation at the end of the
year. Now that all points up a very important
fact of which every honourable senator is
well aware, and that is, that in the modern
business world credit is far more important
than cash. I do not need to point out to
honourable senators that nearly all big business transactions are carried out by exchanges
of bank cheques, that is, by transfers of bank
credit from one to another, without any
actual cash or Bank of Canada notes passing from hand to hand.
The third item on the liability side of the
Bank of Canada balance sheet is deposits,
and it includes deposits by the chartered
banks of $623 million odd. Now, as the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) told us last Thursday, the Bank of
Canada Act at the present time requires the
chartered banks to maintain at all times in
the Bank of Canada a minimum cash reserve
of at least 5 per cent of their total liabilities
to depositors in Canada. That provision has
now been taken out of the Bank of Canada
Act and incorporated into the Bank Act, while
the 5 per cent is being increased to 8 per cent;
and furthermore, as my honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) told us, in
actual practice the chartered banks normally
retain a reserve of 10 per cent in cash against
their deposit liabilities in Canada. And, as
I say, since 1935, the Bank of Canada Act
has required that the chartered banks shall
keep these reserves in the Bank of Canada.
These cash reserves of the chartered banks
are held in the Bank of Canada partly in
the form of the Bank of Canada's own notes
but principally in the form of deposits with
the Bank of Canada which they can exchange
for Bank of Canada notes any time they want
83280-36À

to do so. It is this item of the deposits of
the chartered banks in the Bank of Canada
that is responsible for the figure of $623
million to which I have referred.
I have now discussed the three principal
items of liabilities on the Bank of Canada's
balance sheet; namely, capital and rest fund,
$15,000,000; notes in circulation, $1,600 million; deposits of the chartered banks $623
million. Add to these a few other items,
such as deposits by the government, liabilities payable in foreign currencies, and so on,
and there is a total of $2,437 million on the
liability side of the Bank of Canada balance
sheet as at December 31 last. These items
together represent the capital funds which
the bank had at its disposal.
To turn to the assets side of this same
balance sheet, let us see what the bank has
done with these capital funds of $2,437 million. First of all there are some items, large
in amount but relatively small in proportion
to the total: holdings of foreign exchange,
$55,000,000; cheques on other banks-which
of course are the equivalent of cash$43,000,000; shares of the Industrial Development Bank, $25,000,000; bank premises,
But by far the
approximately $5,000,000.
largest item on the assets side of the Bank
of Canada balance sheet is: investments,
$2,308 million. That figure is broken down
into certain items: short-term securities
issued or guaranteed by the Government of
Canada or provincial governments, $1,376
million; other securities issued or guaranteed
by the Government of Canada or provincial
governments, $893 million; and a few other
securities. The house will observe that by
far the largest asset of the Bank of Canada
consists of short-term securities issued or
guaranteed by the Dominion or by provincial
governments. Under the Bank of Canada
Act "short-term securities" are defined as
securities which mature less than two years
after the date of their acquisition by the
Bank of Canada.
The bill contains certain changes in the
requirements as to what kind of securities
the Bank of Canada shall purchase. I shall
mention these in a few minutes.
I come now to the basic question: How,
with this set-up, with these assets and with
these liabilities, is the Bank of Canada able
to perform the function prescribed for it in
the words in the preamble of the Act which
I have read "to regulate credit . . . and to

mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the
general level of production, trade, prices and
This involves complicated
employment"?
questions of economic and monetary policy,

SENATE
on which volumes have been written, but I
can only attempt to give a most general and
perfunctory description of how the system
works.
Bear in mind that the business life of the
country is carried on very largely by credit.
The amount of credit available to carry on
and expand business depends very largely
upon the amount of money-that is, not
actual bank notes, but bank credit-that the
chartered banks have available for the purpose of lending to their customers or for
investment at any given time. As I said,
the chartered banks normally maintain cash
reserves with the Bank of Canada equal
to 10 per cent of their deposit liabilities.
To the extent, therefore, that the cash reserves of the chartered banks are increased,
their ability to extend credit to their borrowers is increased over a period of time by
approximately ten times the amount by which
their cash reserves have been increased. Conversely, any decrease in the cash reserves of
the chartered banks results in a reduction,
over a term of time, of approximately ten
times that reduction in the amount of credit
that they can extend to their customers.
I must say I had considerable difficulty in
understanding this, but I am assured that it
is true that the amount of credit which a
bank can extend to its customers, and thereby
the amount that it can loan for the trade and
business of the country, varies to the degree
of ten times the amount of cash reserves
which it happens to have at any given time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It sounds almost like Social
Credit.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. This is the precise point where the Bank of Canada comes
in. The Bank of Canada is in a position
to control and to vary the amount of cash
reserves of the chartered banks. It does that
by buying and selling securities on the market-almost entirely short-term government
securities. These are referred to as the "open
market operations" of the Bank of Canada.
The system works in this way. Suppose for
example that the Bank of Canada is of
opinion that the economy of the country needs
stimulation, and that more bank credit is
required. In that case it buys government
securities on the market. Take a concrete
case: suppose the Bank of Canada buys $10
million of government securities on the
market. It pays the sellers by cheques drawn
on the bank itself. What do the sellers do
with those cheques? Of course they deposit
them in their own accounts with the chartered
banks. In turn, the chartered banks deposit
these cheques to their credit with the Bank
of Canada, and the cash reserves of the
chartered banks with the Bank of Canada are

increased by that amount. This increase in
turn forms the basis on which the chartered
banks conclude that they can safely lend
to their customers up to ten times the amount
of their increased cash reserves. When that
operation takes place, the general effect is
that money becomes easier to borrow and
interest rates on borrowed money tend to go
down. That, of course, accords with the
old law of supply and demand.
Take the converse case. Suppose the Bank
of Canada feels that there is an over-expansion of bank credit and a tendency towards
inflation. It will then sell government securities from its portfolio on the market. The
exact opposite of what I have already described then takes place. The purchasers
issue cheques in payment for these securities
on their own chartered banks. The result is
a decrease in the cash reserves of the
chartered banks, and a consequent decrease
of about ten times the amount of that decrease in the lending power of the chartered
banks. The general effect of an operation of
that kind is that money becomes tighter, borrowing is discouraged, and interest rates tend
to rise.
The way the system worked in 1953 is
clearly set out in the Annual Report of the
Bank of Canada to the Minister of Finance, a
copy of which I hold in my hand, and from
which I shall quote two sentences appearing
on page 12:
During the first nine months when there was a
strong demand for bank loans the Bank of Canada
reduced slightly its holdings of government securities and the cash position of the banks tended to
be on the tight side. In the final quarter of the
year when the demand for bank loans was easing
somewhat the Bank of Canada was a net buyer of
securities.

That simply means that during the first
nine months the Bank of Canada deemed it
wise to restrict the extension of credit, while
during the last three months it thought it
advisable to increase it.
Honourable senators, those are the openmarket operations carried on by the Bank
of Canada in fulfilment of its function to

regulate credit and trade. These open-market
operations are not the only means by which

the Bank of Canada can affect the credit
position of the country. A great deal can
be done, and is donc, by consultation and
agreement between the Bank of Canada and
the chartered banks without any positive
action by the Bank of Canada being necessary. One example of that was given by my
honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) last Thursday when he referred to
the action two years ago of the Bank of
Canada and the chartered banks, when it
was decided that there was too great a cail

JUNE 8, 1954
on credit, with the possibility of inflation, and
by agreement the chartered banks restricted
their loans to their customers.
This method of open market operations of
the Bank of Canada sounds easy enough if
you can understand it, although I am afraid
I had a good deal of difficulty in doing so
myself. Here again I think I should repeat
what I said about the warning which the
preamble to the act contains. Monetary action
alone cannot ensure unending prosperity.
There are other factors involved, of which I
have mentioned a few. If honourable senators want a simile, I think one can say that
the function of a central bank is like that
of the stabilizers which have been installed
on some modern ships. The function of a
stabilizer is to try to keep the ship on an
even keel. It cannot prevent the ship from
running into storms, but when the storms
come the stabilizer tends to prevent the
extreme rolling and pitching which might
otherwise endanger the ship and which would
certainly cause extreme discomfort and distress to the passengers and crew.
In talking about economic storms it is
interesting to speculate what would have
been the effect if the Bank of Canada had
been in existence when this country ran into
the economic hurricane of October, 1929 as
a result of the catastrophic fall in security
markets at that time. The hurricane could
not have been avoided; its sources lay
largely outside of Canada and some of its
origins had little to do with questions of
monetary policy. I think it is safe to say,
however, that there are at least two ways
in which the Bank of Canada, had it been in
existence in 1929, could have stabilized the
ship and have moderated the severity of the
storm.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt the honourable gentleman to ask a question at this
point? Did I understand him correctly to
say that the depression of 1929 was not caused
by the Conservatives?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shall go even further
and say that it was not even caused by the
honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar).
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
from Churchill was not in the government at
that time.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes, he was.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, he was not.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Order!
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I was attempting to describe two ways in
which the Bank of Canada would have been

able to mitigate the severity of the depression in 1929. During the period of 1928-29
there was an orgy of speculation on the stock
markets, indulged in by a great many people
who should never have been in the stock
market at all. This was done with money
borrowed by their brokers from the banks.
I feel certain that had the Bank of Canada
been in existence at that time, long before
the crash came in October of 1929 the Bank
would have foreseen that danger.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And either by positive
action in reducing bank credits or by agreement with the chartered banks, similar to
the agreement made two years ago, it would
have seen to it that that orgy of speculation
was curtailed before it became too great. In
the second place, when the crash actually
came, the chartered banks had to face enormous demands for cash, and their reserves
were depleted to a tremendous degree. The
only way they had to replenish their cash
reserves-and they had to do it-was to call
in a great number of call loans, money which
they had loaned to people who, if they had
been given time, would have been able to
get out of their difficulties and repay their
loans without any trouble. As it was, the
banks had no recourse but to call a large
number of these loans, and the result simply
aggravated the catastrophe and added to the
disaster. Had the Bank of Canada been in
existence in 1929 it could, by the operation
I have described, have replenished the cash
reserves of the chartered banks, and this
would have enabled them to avoid having
to call all of those loans and to create the
additional misery which resulted from the
depression.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could not the great central reserve bank of the United States have
performed that function in that country?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My understanding is
that there was no central bank in existence
in the United States at the time of the
depression of 1929.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Not performing the same
function as a bank.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the experience
of the United States was similar to ours,
that after the depression they decided to
create a central bank to look after disasters
of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was under the impression they had such a bank then.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is it not a fact that a
central bank might have prevented some of

SENATE
our chartered banks from holding large
amounts of, in many cases, worthless stock
from foreign countries?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That may have been
so, but I think that would have been done
more by the Superintendent of Banks than
by the Bank of Canada.
Honourable senators, I have attempted, I
am afraid at rather inordinate length, to
deal with the two principal functions of the
Bank of Canada. Those two functions are,
first, to regulate the cash reserves of the
chartered banks and thereby control the
credit of the country, and, second, to regulate
the issue of bank notes. The Bank of Canada
has other functions which I shall mention
very briefly. It acts as the fiscal agent for
the federal government. In other words, it
manages the government's funded debt, and
that fact is important when you realize that
the federal government has outstanding
nearly $12 billion of obligations in the form
of victory bonds and other similar liabilities.
Closely connected with that function, the
Bank of Canada also gives financial and
economic advice to the government. One
very recent example of the working of these
two functions combined has been the recent
calling for redemption, before their maturity, of the third and fourth Victory loans,
.aggregating several hundred millions of dollars, at a time when bank credit is abundant
.and interest rates low; and I am bound to
:say that I think that that is a condition of
affairs to which the bank's own policy during
the past few months bas contributed, and
contributed designedly. The government has
thus been enabled to sell $850 million in new
securities to replace the Victory loans called
at a low rate of interest, and on favourable
terms. The whole of that operation has been
carried out through the agency of the Bank
of Canada.
One final function of the Bank of Canada
is to maintain economic and financial
research and analysis of conditions and
trends, not only in Canada but throughout
the world.
The Bank of Canada has a very highly
qualified and competent staff which keeps
watch upon the economic and monetary
situation in the world at ail times. The bank
-nust be in a position to advise the government from day to day on monetary and
economic conditions, upon which public
policy can be based.
One very striking example of the way in
which the experience of the Bank of Canada

was valuable to the government was given
at the very critical time when the war broke
out, in 1939, and it was necessary to regulate
and control foreign exchange. The government had in the Bank of Canada an instrument immediately available with all the
necessary knowledge and technical advice at
its disposal. The Foreign Exchange Control
Board was in effect a part, or a subsidiary,
of the Bank of Canada; and I think every
honourable senator will agree with me that
during its existence the Foreign Exchange
Control Board carried out its functions in
an admirable way.
I have now completed my analysis of the
way in which the Bank of Canada carries
out the statutory duties it is called upon to
perform.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Before leaving that
point, would the honourable senator go one
step farther and tell the bouse who directs
the policy of the bank as to when credit
should be expand:ed and when it should be
diminished, as be bas indicated is done?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, that is a function primarily of the Governor and the directors of the Bank of Canada, but I assume
that they must always act in co-operation
with the Department of Finance and the
government of the day.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The honourable gentleman read from the annual statement of the
Bank of Canada. Can he say how much
profit the bank made last year?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The profit for the year
ending December 31, 1953, after making provision for contingencies and reserves was
$44,092,807.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does that amount go to
the consolidated fund?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Not alh of it; some of
it goes into the rest fund, and I will explain
that later.
At this point there is one thing I feel bound
to do, and I am sure honourable senators will
agree with me, and that is to pay a really
heartfelt tribute to the man who bas been the
Governor of the Bank of Canada ever since it
was founded in 1934-Mr. Graham Towers.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And to the exceedingly
able staff which be has selected to assist him
in the administration of the Bank of Canada's
affairs.
That, honourable senators, completes the
preamble; I now come to consideration of the
bill itself.

JUNE 8, 1954
Hon. Mr. Hornei,: Would the honourable
senator include in his words of congratulations
the man who selected the man for that high
position?
Hon. Mr. Euler: He did.
Hon. Mr. Horner: 1 thank him very much
for the gratitude he has expressed, but I do
flot think hie included the man who selected
the man who is now Governor of the bank.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think I have already
said that in this whole matter of the establishment of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Bennett
deserves great commendation.
Hon. Mr. Harner: You should mention the
benefit it was to Canada to have a business
man pass this way, if only for a short period
of four or five years.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I entirely agree with
my friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Hornier).
Hon. Mr. Euler: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The bill contains four
or five important amendments to which I
should draw the attention of the bouse.
I have mentioned the minimum cash
reserves which chartered banks are required
to maintain with the Bank of Canada. The
minimum, which is now 5 per cent, will by.
the proposed new Bank Act be raised to 8
per cent, and as a matter of practice the
banks maintain a cash reserve of 10 per cent.
Under paragraph (o) of subsection (1) of
section 18 of the bill, the Bank of Canada is
given the right to vary, again in an upward
direction, the reserves which the chartered
banks are required to maintain with the
Bank of ;Canada, between the minimum of 8
per cent, called for by the Bank Act, and a
maximum of 12 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: 0f what?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: 0f their total deposit
liabilities la Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be permitted to interrupt the honourable gentleman to ask him
what the Bank of Canada pays by way of
interest on the reserves set up by the char±ered banks?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Nothing is paid by way
of interest; these are simply demand deposits.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No interest is paid?

are required to maintain with the Bank of
Canada, between 8 and 12 per cent, subject ta
the condition that a month's notice of any
variation is given, and subject also to the
provision that the percentage must not be
increased by more than one per cent per
month. This amendment puts an effective
weapon into the hands of the Bank of Canada
to control the danger of inflation.
Perhaps I should say here what it is
intended that this amendment should do. The
addition of the power to vary reserve requirements to the techniques now available to the
Bank of Canada in implementing monetary
policy, will bring them into lime with those
of central banks in other countries. However, it is not the intention or expectation
that this power is one wvhich will be frequently used. Much more likely it will be
,limited to special and temporary situations
where the present methods of restraining
monetary expansion need to be supplemented. Incidentally, it is believed that an
announcement by the central bank of an
increase in reserve requirements would have
helpful psychological effects. It would be
a specific indication to the chartered banks'
customers that restraint in the use of credit
was necessary, and that the banks' capacity
to increase loans was being restricted.
The second amendment to which I wish to
refer has to do with the rest fund, and is
set out in section 12 of the bill. Under the
original act of 1935, it was expected that the
rest fund would stop as soon as it became
twice the amount of the issued capital, which
it has now reached. The fund is now $10
million, while the original capital is $5 million. This amendment will provide that onefifth of the annual profits of the bank are to
be added to the present rest fund until such
time as the rest fund reaches five times the
issued capital of the bank., or $25 million.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: It is a reserve fund?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Connolly: Is a tax paid on that
reserve? I do not believe it is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It has nothing to do
with tax.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The entire profit of the
Bank of Canada, after setting aside its
reserve and so on, goes directly to the
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, no interest at ail. Minister of Finance; whether he places a
The reserves may be likened to open accounts tax upon it in his own hands or not, I do not
such as you or I might maintain with a bank know. 1 think it is unlikely.
Certain changes are brought about by paraand which earn no interest, in contradistinction to savings accounts. As I say, under titis graph (d) of subsection (1) of section 18 in
bill the Bank of Canada is given the right to the requirement as to securities which the
vary the reserves which the chartered banks bank is allowed to purchase. The present

SENATE
act restricts the purchase of securities maturing more than two years after their purchase
by the bank. Under the proposed amendment
those restrictions are removed, because they
are felt to be no longer necessary.
The bill provides various changes in the
internal administration of the bank, but they
are not of great importance, and a good many
of them are drafting amendments and nothing
more.
The bank will continue to be managed by a
Governor, a Deputy Governor, and the
twelve directors, but provision is made that
the annual remuneration of the twelve directors be increased from $20,000 to $30,000.
This, under modern conditions, is not unreasonable.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How many directors are
there?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Twelve.
There are a few other amendments, but I
do not think they are important enough to
discuss at this stage; they can more profitably
and fruitfully be gone into when the bill is
considered in committee.
I should like to conclude by making a
statement with which I am sure every
honourable senator will agree. The Bank of
Canada bas fully justified the hope of its
founders, and bas demonstrated the wisdom
of establishing it. It is a valuable, indeed an
essential, instrument for carrying out the
policies of the country in monetary and economic affairs.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Will my honourable friend
permit an interruption? Was the Bank of
Canada started as a private institution or
under government auspices?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I did not deal with
that point, but the fact is that when the Bank
of Canada was first started by Mr. Bennett,
in 1934, he took as an example the Bank of
England, which had a good deal of private
capital. When the Bank of Canada opened
it had a capital of $5 million, of which half
was subscribed by the government and the
public was invited to subscribe to the remaining $2½ million. The dividends were limited
to 4½ per cent, and the right of the public
to control was limited to electing one less
than a majority of the board of directors.
When the King government came into power,
in 1935, it felt-and I think this was the only
difference of opinion between the two political parties with regard to the Bank of
Canada-that it was better for the whole of
the capital of the bank to be owned by the
government; therefore, in 1936 the King
administration bought from the public the
$21 million capital, which meant that the
total shares of the bank, to the value of $5

million, were then held as they still are
today, by the Minister of Finance for the
people of Canada.
I would add one word, honourable senators: the Bank of Canada from its inception
has been managed with the utmost ability
and integrity.
I move the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I congratulate the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) on his
splendid explanation of the bill before the
house.
May I be permitted to say a few words on
this important measure? I agree that the
Bank of Canada controls the economy of this
country. For that reason it is necessary that
its governor be not only a clever man, but
an able man. It is the function of the Bank
of Canada to control inflation or deflation. To
make wise decisions in the performance of
their duties, the directors must have wide
knowledge of financial matters. Before they
act they must take into consideration not
only the economy of Canada, but also that of
the United States and of the world. During
the period from 1932 to 1938 certain other
countries set up central banks, but these
failed to control the economies of their countries in time. During the past year we have
seen things happen in countries not very
far from here which caused the Bank of
Canada to change its policy with regard to
them.
After the close of the war, around the year
1947, Canadian government bonds were selling in the open market at $108 per $100 bond.
Of course, the Bank of Canada was maintaining that price. As recently as last
December Canadian government bonds of
$100 face value, 1966 maturity, were selling
at $92, and many organizations which had
invested their funds in these bonds were
obliged to sell at a big loss. At the present
time Canadian government bonds are practically at par, and I think that the Bank of
Canada is responsible, inasmuch as one of
its functions is to protect our money.
On the question of exchange rates between
Canadian and United States currencies, I am
personally of the opinion that it would be
better for Canada if the currencies of both
countries were at par with each other. If
there is a big difference in exchange rates
between the two, I am sure that we are the
losers, certainly in the markets of the world.
I think that this difference in exchange rates
has had some effect on the prices of our
bonds during the last few months.
I am sure that, considering all the factors
involved, the Governor of the Bank of Canada

JUNE 8, 1954
is doing his best to protect our markets, our
money, and the general interests of the citizens of Canada. Honourable senators will
realize that it is very difficuit to control the
economy of our country. Before the war Bank
of Canada notes in circulation amounted to
$350 million. At the present time the total is
$1,600 million-practically 5 times as muchwhile the population has not increased anything like that. That would indicate a degree
of inflation. However, business has expanded
and prices have increased.
That brings up another question, one that
people throughout the country ask: why does
the governiment not print bank notes? Well,
it is a very easy matter to print bank notes,
but the question that follows is more important, namely: after they are printed, what
value is placed upon them? We sometimes
think that from. the point of vîew of small
businessmen in the country the printing of
bank notes by the governiment might be a
good thing for the economy of the country.
Organizations sometimes advocate that step,
but I personally think it is better for the
governiment to sell debentures or bonds.
Let me illustrate by taking the case of
Germany. I was in Germany in 1922, about
the time inflation was setting in; and when 1
arrived I could get only 80 marks for $1
Canadian, and during the next three days the
price fell to a point where 600 marks could
be bought for $1. The situation deteriorated
rapidly, and a month later the number of
marks that could be bought for $1 was
1,000. Canada, on the other hand, did not go
tbrough anything like that. It is one of the
functions of the Bank of Canada to control
inflation and deflation, but this must be done
in conjuniction with other countries. In order
to develop our own economy it is necessary to
act wîth other countries.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
1 amn sure we all appreciated the very clear
explanation given by the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), on the
legislation before us. It undoubtedly points
Up the importance of a central banking system
to the economy of any country.
I listened with interest also to the remarks
by the honourable member for Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt), especially his remarks
about Germany. Indeed, we ail remember
Germany's plight, when her currency was
completely debased and became worthless,
and her people found themselves, seemingly
with ail their life savings gone. Subsequently,
Dr. Schact set up a monetary system that
enabled Germany to replace its slums with
modern houses, and to build a war potential
that was almost equal to any in the world.
But at the end of the war Dr. Schact was

arrested and tried for being the brains behind
the financial arrangements that made it
possible for Hitler to finance his military
operations. Of late Dr. Schact has been
visiting several countries, presumably advising on monetary systems, but how successful
hie has been I do not know.
I agree that the banking business requires
men of exceptional talent. However, for my
own part, banking is usually a simple matter
of borrowing enough money to do business
with.
My chief purpose in rising, honourable
,senators, was to thank the honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) for
the very painstaking speech that he made on
this bll.
Han. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator from. Inkerman a question? Section
7 provides that the board may appoint one or
more Deputy Governors; section 6, subsection
(1), provides that the Deputy Governor shall
be appointed by the directors with the
approval. of the Governor in Council; and
according to section 5, subsection (1), the
board of directors shaîl be composed of a
Governor, a Deputy Governor, and twelve
directors. I do not understand the provision
in section 7 whereby the board may appoint
one or more Deputy Governors, for I am
wondering just what authority the deputies
would have. And will the Governor in
Council have any control. over the appointment of these Deputy Governors?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I arn afraid that 1 amn
unable to answer my honourable friend with
any accuracy. The Governor and the Deputy
Governor, with twelve directors, constitute
the board of directors of the bank. That is,
provided for in section 5. 1 think all that
section 7 does is to provide that the board
may appoint some subordinate official as an
assistant or, as we might cail hlm, an
associate governor who is not the deputy
governor and is not a member of the board.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That could be ciarifled in
committee?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps the wording
mnay cali for some change to clarify that
situation.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I hope that other honourable senators will contribute to the discussion of this
bill, because it is, I believe, a fundamental
and very important piece of legislation.
In my opinion, the honourable senator for
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) bas presented
the bill in ahl its aspects most lucidly and
admirably. Naturally, some questions arise
which can be dealt with in committee. The

SENATE
matter to which the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has just
referred, that is what may be called the
"tidying-up" of the organization of the bank
as prescribed in the first clauses of the bill,
does not materially change the character of
the organization. One outstanding feature
which he must have noticed is that it is to
be made legally possible for an officiai of the
bank to be also a director of another crown
company, such as the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation. Also, every member
of the board must be a Canadian citizen, not
just a British subject. These little points
are referred to in the bill. But the main
feature of the legislation, as the honourable
senator from Inkerman has so well brought
out, is that for an indefinite time, at least so
far as the Minister of Finance or anyone
else can foresee, it establishes the authority
of the central bank as the director and the
great guiding light of the country's financial
and fiscal policy. Currency, for example, is
finally put under the control of the central
bank, and any outstanding currencies of the
old banks will be completely eliminated from
circulation.
Some questions have been asked about the
relation of the Bank of Canada to the economic conditions in Canada as a whole, and
some references by way of comparison have
been made to the functions and the operations of the reserve system of the United
States at the time of the depression which
began in 1929. The big difference between
ourselves and our neighbours was that we
had then, as we have now, as a basis of the
finances of this country a branch banking
system. The United States never had a
branch banking system in the same sense.
The reserve banking system with which it
met the situation in 1929-30 was composed
of a series of isolated units related to the
operations of innumerable local banks here
and there which had given too much credit
and had overvalued securities of one kind
and another, including farm mortgages. Our
branch banks, of course, gave credit, but al
of them were and are connected very
definitely with a few central head offices in
direct contact with the government through
the Department of Finance. It was necessary
for the Government of Canada, under the
regime of the late Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, te stabilize the values of securities
held by the head offices of our branch banks.
Probably the episode has been forgotten, but
at that time arbitrary measures were taken,
and I think, wisely. Looking back now, it
seems to me they reflect a great deal of
credit on the courage of the Prime Minister
of that day, who was also pretty much in
control of the Finance Department as well,

in setting an arbitrary value on certain
securities and thereby enabling the banks to
carry on the national economy. Fortunately
things came out ail right. That function,
which was then performed by the federal
Department of Finance would now be performed by the Bank of Canada in conjunction with the Minister of Finance.
I think that in this legislation there is
some suggestion, in the increasing of reserves
from 8 to 12 per cent, or possibly higher,
that in relation to fiscal policy the Bank of
Canada and the Minister of Finance have
their eyes fixed on the future, a future whose
horizon is not so far removed from the
present time.
Regarding action which may have to be
taken, as far as any action can be taken, to
meet another economic depression, it may be
recalled that the depression of 1929-30 did
not originate either in this country or in the
United States. It was pretty largely the consequence of a bad war settlement, including
attempts to finance the obligations of the
peace treaty of 1919. When the loans made
to Germany were repudiated, the impact
upon the New York market really started
the downward movement. At the same time
the world was cluttered up with unsaleable
commodities. Canadian wheat and flour were
lying in ports ail over the world, and their
owners, of course, had to bear the losses
resulting from declining prices. The experience of that time gave rise to a great deal
of discussion as to financial measures which
might be taken to secure Canada from the
recurrence of such a violent depression.
It must be said that the central Bank of
Canada was distirctly bi-partisan in origin.
The credit for having parliament set up the
foundation of a central bank in this country
must naturally go to the Prime Minister of
that day, the Right Honourable Mr. Bennett.
However, I remember very distinctly that
when a certain by-election was being held in
an Ontario constituency, the Leader of the
Opposition at that time made a speech in
which he advocated the need for monetary
reform and the establishment of a central
bank in Canada. The person who benefited
somewhat by the outcome of the issue in that
by-election is my honourable friend from
Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding), who is sitting in this chamber right now. It was following that by-election that the Prime Minister
went to England, where he consulted with
Sir Montague Norman, the head of the Bank
of England. He asked Sir Montague's advice
about establishing a central bank for Canada,
and Sir Montague told him that every civilized country should have a central bank in
those days. Even before the Prime Minister
returned to Canada arrangements were made

JUNE 8, 1954
with Lord Macmillan ta head a commission
ta sit in this country and make a report, which
was ta become the foundation for aur central
bank.
Just as the appointment of the first Canadian Governor General in this country can
be traced ta a suggestion made by a Conservative Prime Minister, sa possibly can the establishment of a central bank i Canada be
attributed partly at least ta the proposai of
the Leader of the Opposition in the first five
years of the thirties.

ATOMIC ENERGY CONTROL BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. George P. Burchill moved the second
reading of Bill 393, an Act respecting the
Atomic Energy Control Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill 393
deals with a subject which I regard as one of
the most important, as well as amazing,
developments of modern science, and one
which will have a most profound influence on
the future development of this great country
-I refer to atomic energy.
In order to approach the purpose of the bill
in an intelligent way it will be necessary to
sketch briefly a little of the history of our
Canadian effort and program in the field of
atomic energy. You will recall that it was
in 1942 that our government joined with the
governments of the United Kingdom and the
United States in an effort to produce an
atomic bomb. In those days we supplied
the uranium-the raw material of the bomb
-and we also made available the facilities
of the National Research Council. This research led to the project at Chalk River

under the direction of the National Research
Council, and was primarily concerned with
winning the war.
After the war, when it became apparent
that an international agreement concerning
the eliminating or control of the atomic
weapon could not be reached, consideration
had to be given to the future direction of our
Canadian program and the best way of
administering it, both as regards the supply
of the necessary raw material, uranium, and
also the future objectives of the Chalk River
project-was it to be bombs or blessings?
As regards the supply of raw material, it
was decided to increase the existing source
of supply, which was under the control of
a crown company, Eldorado Mining and
Refining Limited, at Port Radium, and also
to seek new sources, which would involve
the prospector and the mining industry.
Accordingly in March, 1948, the minister
announced a price schedule for uranium ores,
guaranteed now until March, 1962. Now, as
regards the Chalk River project, it was
found that the NRX reactor, which was built
by using heavy water as the moderator and
natural uranium as the fuel, proved to be
the most efficient reactor of its type in the
world and, as such, offered a unique opportunity for exploring the peacetime application of atomic energy, and establishing its
use as an energy source for electric power;
and accordingly it was decided that the program of research and development at Chalk
River should be continued and expanded.
It followed, of course, that the necessary
administrative machinery should be set up,
and in 1946 an act was passed providing for
the establishment of an Atomic Energy Control Board, which would be responsible for
the overall direction of the program and the
administration of security regulations. The
President of Eldorado was appointed a
member of the board, so that it could be
kept fully informed of activities in the raw
materials field, and it was arranged that the
National Research Council should continue to
operate the Chalk River project subject to
direction by the board in matters of policy,
including approval of the operating and
research budgets.
The President of the
National Research Council was appointed to
the Atomic Energy Control Board, and later
became its president.
This arrangement continued until 1952,
when the Chalk River project became incorporated under the name of Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited, and the Board of Directors
reported to the Atomic Energy Control
Board, the president of the board becoming
the president of the new company. That

SENATE
organization, however, is no longer adequate,
and the present bill seeks to provide administrative machinery which will enable the program to go forward along the road which
very significant developments would indicate
is feasible, as well as most desirable, for the
work at Chalk River has now reached a
stage where it is believed that it is possible
to produce atomic power within a range of
cost which will be economic-and by that
I mean comparable to the cost of producing
power generated from a steam plant using
coal at a cost of $8 per ton. A continuing
supply of uranium is a very important factor.
At the present time the production of
uranium is three times as great as it was at
the end of the war, and it is estimated that
this production will increase so that by 1956
it will be eight times as great as it was at
the end of the war.
The ultimate benefits which the development of the Chalk River project will bring
to the Canadian economy cannot be measured
in dollars. The first of these benefits is the
production of radioisotopes for use in medical
treatment, research and industrial processes.
The Commercial Products Division of Atomic
Energy of Canada Limited is responsible for
marketing these isotopes, and for developing
new uses for them. It has been the policy
to work closely with the medical profession,
and this division will shortly move to a new
building in Ottawa which is fully equipped
with all the necessary facilities. The medical
gentlemen in the chamber will be much more
familiar than I am with the possibilities or
potentialities of this form of treatment for
mankind, but the Cobalt 60 Beam Therapy
Unit has earned a world-wide reputation as
a potent weapon to combat cancer, and the
demand for these units, both here and
abroad, is greater than can be met by the
crown company. Units have already been
installed in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver,
Winnipeg, and lately in Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And Saskatoon.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Canadian-built equipment has been provided for hospitals in New
York, Chicago and Minneapolis; also for a
hospital in London, England, and for a medical centre in Italy. It is hoped that each
province will be provided with one of these
units. I understand that plans are under
way to establish two units in the new Ontario
Cancer Institute, in Toronto, and that additional units are to be provided in Windsor,
Ottawa, Kingston and Port Arthur. As my
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
reminded me, somehow I missed Saskatoon.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That was one of the
first places to have the treatment.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: The second benefit to
be derived from the Chalk River project is
atomie power. As our economy expands we
must expect a continuing rise in power consumed, and the availability of power will be
a condition of our growth in the future. It
is estimated that by 1979 Canada will require
an installed capacity of 40 million kilowatts.
This is based on a current annual increase
of 6 per cent in power demand. Our estimated total hydro potential in Canada is 50
million kilowatts, of which we are using at
the present time 10 million kilowatts, or 20
per cent. As water power is not available
for use in many districts, it might be safe to
estimate that only about 30 million kilowatts
of our hydro potential could be used; and this
would leave a shortage of 10 million kilowatts, which might be supplied by atomic
power. In certain localities where coal and
oil or natural gas are easily available atomie
power will probably not compete, but in
other sections of Canada, such as the Maritime Provinces and sections of the middle
west where there is a great shortage of
power, atomic power may supply the answer
to the power problem. In my own province
of New Brunswick industrial development
has been stunted, and our young people have
been, and are, obliged to seek employment
elsewhere. One of the causes of this has
undoubtedly been the shortage of adequate
power.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What progress has been
made in the field of atomic power up to
date? Can you give us any information on
that?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Only what I glean from
statements made by officials, and it has been
made sufficiently clear by them that atomic
power can be produced competitively as
against production of power in a steam plant
using coal costing $8 a ton.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is cheaper than
natural gas.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is as far as I can
go. As I am not a scientist I am taking the
word of someone else for that statement.
While the cost of atomic power must be
competitive and sound economically, perhaps
the cost is not such a great factor as one
would think. In this connection it might be
interesting if I quoted some figures published
by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics which
give a comparison of a monthly electric
power bill at various places across Canada
for a load of 100 horsepower used 200 hours
per month in 1952.
At St. John's Newfoundland, the cost would
be $377.42. In Nova Scotia it would range

Hon. Mr. Burchill: No, I have no figures
for Rosetown.
In Alberta the cost would range from a
high at Lethbridge of $298.15 to a low at
Calgary of $172.26; and in British Columbia
from a high at Vancouver of $320.77 to a
low at Kamloops of $208.17.
These figures would indicate that while an
abundant supply of power is a very definite
requirement and most necessary, within certain ranges the cost does not seem to have
a very great bearing on the industrial
growth.
As a step towards informing those responsible for producing power in Canada of the
scope of the program at Chalk River, an
Advisory Committee on Atomic Power is
to be set up consisting of senior executive
officials of all the power commissions and
power corporations in Canada. This Committee will meet here at Ottawa to consult
on the development of the Chalk River plant.
Now I will deal with the bill itself. It
will make some changes in the administrative machinery, all designed to meet the
needs of the present situation and enable
the undertaking to function more efficiently.
Under the new set-up Eldorado Mining and
Refining Limited will continue to have
responsibility for production and procurement of the raw materials, and Atomic
Energy of Canada Limited will continue to
have responsibility for the operation of the
Chalk River plant, but the name of the corporation will be changed to Nuclear Research

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Could our honourable
friend give us any information on the progress that has been made in England in
making atomic energy available for the production of power? It appears that the British
have advanced much further in that line
than we have. Has the honourable senator
any information on that?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am afraid I have no
information of that nature with me at the
moment. However, in the debate on this bill
in the other place, mention was made of the
establishment in England of a power plant
planned for the purpose of producing atomic
power on a cheap basis.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: At what cost?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I have no information
as to the cost.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, my
interjection was due to my understanding that
the Cancer Clinic at Saskatoon is the first
place in Canada, if not in the world, where a
Cobalt bomb was used.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has the honourable
senator any knowledge of what is going on in
Russia in the development of atomic energy?
As a matter of fact this is one of the big factors in world affairs. Russia is behind the
continent of America-not only the United
States, but Canada-in one fundamental
respect, which accounts, perhaps more than
anything else, and much more than its form

Hon.

Mr. Hugessen:

Honourable senators,

perhaps I might be allowed to say a word on
this point, seeing that the reported interjection appears as having been made during the
course o! my remarks. Like the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), I
did not hear the interjection, and in the
words "That may have been so", which I
am reported to have said in reply, I was
referring not to this mythical interjection but
to the question which had been addressed to
me by the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I respectfully point
out that the parliamentary rules on interrupOn the Orders of the Day:

OFFICIAL REPORT OF DEBATE

JUNE 9, 1954
honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) with respect to the
reduction by the Canadian Wheat Board in
the sale price of wheat, I stated right away
that I had no information on that subject,
but that I thought the reduced price applied
to exports only and not to wheat sold in
Canada. The reason why I stated this was
that I was under the impression that the
price of wheat destined for export was
different from the price of wheat sold for
domestic consumption, and I think those in
this house who are familiar with the marketing of wheat will agree with me that at
one time that was the situation. But at
present the price of wheat is the same for
domestic sales as for export sales. Therefore, the reduction announced by the Canadian Wheat Board would apply to all wheat
sold in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am very glad to have the
answer, but I would respectfully point out
that I think the answer is still not quite correct. I agree that there was a time when
there were two prices, when sales were being
made under the International Wheat Agreement. Wheat was sold under that agreement at a certain price, but to other countries
that did not enter into the agreement it was
sold at another price; and very often there
was a conflict between the domestic price
and the price to some other countries. The
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
spoke too and said he did not think the
answer given to me yesterday was correct,
so I inquired and obtained the same information that has been given today with respect
to domestic wheat prices. However, I am
very pleased to receive that information
officially.

(Hon. Mr. Quinn) that honourable senators
from Quebec were absent from the chamber
when the Royal Assent was given to certain
bills.
I desire to correct an impression which
may be spread around that we are derelict
in our duty. As we all know, there is nothing
honourable senators can do when they attend
for the Royal Assent. All that is required is
a quorum under Mr. Speaker, and there are
enough members resident in Ottawa to meet
that requirement. And on the occasion in
question the fort was well guarded by the
honourable gentleman from Bedford-Halifax.
An impression that honourable senators from
Quebec were derelict in not being here for
the Royal Assent would be unfair.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
in reply to the honourable senator from De
Lorimier, (Hon. Mr. Vien) may I say that I
would not have made the remark to which
he takes exception were it not that he
seemed to take so much umbrage at some
words of my leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). That
is why I pointed out that last Thursday evening, when the Royal Assent was given to
several bills, in accordance with what I
consider to be one of my duties as the Whip
on this side I took particular care to check
upon the attendance in the house, and I noted
that not one representative of the province
of Quebec was present.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I can recall occasions when
the Royal Assent was given when even the
honourable senator from Bedford-Halifax
was not present.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I would like the honourable senator to mention an occasion when that
happened.

Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators,
may I interject a remark? Indeed, at one
time there was also a third price, a special
price that Canadian millers paid for wheat,
which was less than that paid under the
International Wheat Agreement or outside
of it.

He said: Honourable senators, by way of
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
on a question of privilege: inasmuch as we preamble to the remarks I am going to make
are dealing with corrections, I should like to I wish to thank two of my colleagues who
refer to a statement made yesterday by the are now in this chamber for the information
honourable member from Bedford-Halifax they provided me in connection with this

SENATE
bill. This information is not to be found
in the bill itself. One of these gentlemen
happens to be the President of the Quebec
Savings Bank, while the other is a Director
of the Montreal City and District Savings
Bank.
Honourable senators, this bill is in no way
contentious, being simply a revision of the
Quebec Savings Banks Act, 1952. The bill
relates to the two banks I have just mentioned-the Montreal City and District Savings Bank, and the Quebec Savings Bankand its main purpose is, so far as possible,
to make it uniform with Bill 338, an Act
respecting banks and banking, which bas
already been studied in this chamber and
is now before our Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The Montreal City and District Savings
Bank and the Quebec Savings Bank were in
existence long before Confederation, having
been granted charters respectively in 1846
and 1848 by acts of the legislature of what
was then known as the Province of Canada.
Their charters have been continued under
federal direction since that time, as have
those of a number of chartered banks that
have been incorporated since then. On the
occasion of the last decennial revision of
the Bank Act the charters of these two institutions were extended, except as provided in
section 7 of this bill:
The provisions of the charter of the bank are
inapplicable
(a) to the extent that there is any inconsistency
between the provisions of the charter and the provisions of this act, and
(b) in respect of any matter for which provision
is made by this act.

Each of the two banks affected by this bill
must confine its operational activities to a
single district in the province of Quebec.
Section 8 of the bill provides that the head
office of the Montreal City and District Savings Bank shall be in the city of Montreal,
and the bank may operate branches within
the district of Montreal and surrounding
counties. Section 9 of the bill provides that
the Quebec Savings Bank shall have its
headquarters in the city of Quebec and that
the bank may operate branches and operate
within the district of Quebec.
The question may be raised: what kind
of banks are these if they are not incorporated under the Bank Act? Before attempting to answer this question I would ask your
indulgence while I read section 19 of the
charter of the Montreal City and District
Savings Bank, which was granted under the

signature of Lord Lisgar on April 29, 1871.
A reading of section 19 will at least disclose
what these banks are not.
Nothing in this charter shall be construed as
intended to make the said bank a bank within the
meaning of the act of the Parilament of Canada
passed in the thirty-fourth year of our reign and
intituled "An Act relating to banks and banking,"
so as to entitle it to any of the special privileges,
or to subject it to any of the special restrictions
conferred or imposed on banks by that act unless
they are conferred or imposed on it by this charter
or by the act first cited herein.

I doubt whether I could give the house a
better definition of these banks than the one
contained in the bill itself, which sets out
that a "bank means a bank to which this
act applies." Let us say that they are institutions which have been empowered to
receive deposits and make personal loans.
These loans, made to individuals, are limited
to $2,000, the rate of which shall never exceed
6 per cent.
One may ask why these banks were established in the first place. The answer is that
they were brought into existence to enable
people to make deposits and receive personal
loans. At the present time eleven chartered
banks, through hundreds of their branches
located all over this country, are providing
service in the way of savings accounts, but it
should be borne in mind that was not so in
1846 and 1848. In those years and many years
following, chartered banks were not the democratic institutions they are today. They were
few in number and would not accept deposits
of less than $5,000, which in those times would
represent approximately $25,000 in presentday currency. In the meantime, the Montreal
City and District Savings Bank and the Quebec Savings Bank have served to fill the gap.
They came into existence out of necessity, to
induce common people with small incomes to
save, and as an incentive they offered interest
on savings and provided protection against
loss in the case of fire and theft.
I have been informed that Monsignor Bourget, first Catholic Bishop of Montreal, was
instrumental in the establishment of the
Montreal City and District Savings Bank.
This bank, together with the Quebec Savings
Bank, first known as La Caisse d'Economie,
have served their purpose well and, notwithstanding the incorporation of chartered banks,
have continued to prosper. It is of interest
to note that the board of directors of the
Montreal City and District Savings Bank,
since its inception, has counted among its
members French and English speaking Catholics, English-speaking Protestants and a Jew.
A perusal of today's list of directors will
disclose that these groups are still represented
on the board.

JUNE 9. 1954
The latest report of the Montreal City and
District Savings Bank for the financial year
ending the 3lst of December, 1953, discloses
that its capital stock stands at $2 million, its
reserve fund amounts to $5 million, and its
balance of profit carried forward totals
$380,000. The total value of deposits is over
$190 million.
Bath these banks have a charitable fund,
and last year the Montreal City and District
Savîngs Bank distributed nearly $33,000 out
of this fund, which represents somewhat over
10 per cent of the amount paid to shareholders
by way of dividends.
To sum up, the Quebec savings banks differ
from the chartered banks, particularly because they cannot operate outside of a limited
district and are flot able to make commercial
loans.
Although strictly this bill is a public bill,
a close study of it will show that it is more
in the nature of a prîvate bull. Therefore,
I shaîl limit my remarks to some of the sections with which. honourable senators may be
particularly concernied.
The streamlining of the Quebec Saving
Banks Act with the Bank Act is related
particularly to the keeping of books, returns,
inspections, records and proceedings for
winding up, and so on. I cail attention particularly to section 71, which provides that
no bank shail charge a rate of interest
exceeding 6 per cent.
The main points of the bill, I should say,
relate to loans and investments. As to boans,
section 61 says:
The bank may lend money and make advances
to any person if the bank takes as security for
the repayment of the loan
(a> any of the securities mentioned In section 58,
the market value of which, at the time the loan is
made, is not less than the amount of the boan;,
(b> the shares of a chartered bank or the securities or shares of a corporation other than one
mentioned in section 58, the market value of
which, at the time the boan is made. is not less than
one hundred and twenty per cent of the amount of
the boan; or
(c) a lif e insurance policy, the cash surrender
value of which, at the Uirne the loan is made, is nlot
lesa than the amount of the loan,
and the bank takes the security with authorlty to
senl it or realize thereon.
Section 62 says:
The bank may lend money and make advances
without security to the Government of Canada or
a province.

Section 63 says:
The bank may lend money and mnake advances
without security
(a) to a municipal corporation in Canada;,
(b) to a school corporation In Canada that
derives its revenues from rates or taxes levied by
it or on its behalf;

(c) to an ecclesiastical or religious corporation
incorporated in Canada;
(d) to a fabrique de paroisse or syndic that Is
subj ect to the Parish and Fabrique Act of the
Province of Quebec;
(e) to a corporation incorporated for the purpose
?f operating a hospital or sanitarium in the Province of Quebec;.

provided that boans for all those purposes
shail not exceed 5 per cent of the bank's
deposit liabilities.
The bank may lend money on mortgages
to the extent of 20 per cent, On this point,
I should add that the streamlining proposed
in this bill brings the Quebec savings banks
in bine with the chartered banks as to the
National Housing Act.
By way of investments, section 58 provides
as foblows:
The bank may invest In
(a) securities of or guaranteed by the Government of Canada or of a province;
(b) securities of or guaranteed by the Government of the United Kingdom or of any colony,
dependency or protectorate of the Ulnited Kingdom;
(c) securities of or guaranteed by the government of any other country of the British Commonwealth or of any colony, dependency or protectorate
of any such country;
(d) securities of or guaranteed by the Goverament of the United States of Ainerica or of any
state thereof;
(e) securities of or guaranteed by a municipal
corporation in Canada;
Mf securities of a school corporation in Canada
that derives its revenues from, rates or taxes levied
by it or on its behalf.

Dealing with reserves, section 55 provides
as follows:
(1) The bank shahl at anl times maintain a
reserve equal to at least five per cent of its deposit
liabilities in the forrn of notes of the Bank of
Canada or of deposits with the Bank of Canada or
a chartered bank.
(2) The bank shaîl at ail times maintain a
reserve, in addition to that required by subsection
(1), equal to at least fifteen per cent 0f its deposit
liabilities in the form of
(a) notes of the Bank of Canada or of deposits
with the Bank of Canada or a chartered bank, or
(b) securities of or guaranteed by the Government of Canada or of a province.

You will notice the reserve is not as large
as that stipulated by the new Bank Act for
other banks.
Apparently, judging by their operation,
these new banks do flot show as great a
danger of boss as may be encountered by
many of the other banks.
I do not know of any other section o!
this bill to which I should cail the attention
of honourable senators just now. As I said
at the opening of my remarks, I think this
bil is more in the nature of a private bull.
These banks have fulfilled the mission and
the purpose for which they were established,
and have prospered. They performed a very

SENATE
useful function when other banks were not
in existence at all. I think the Quebec
savings banks deserve to be continued for
another ten years, as the chartered banks
will be. The act provides for the renewal
of their charters in the same way as the
Bank Act provides for the renewal of the
charters of the other banks, in the event
parliament is not sitting when the ten-year
period has elapsed.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: I understand that
this act allows these savings banks to make
loans under the Housing Act, in the same
ways as ordinary banks.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: Yes, it simply adds
to the section regarding mortgage loans.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: It is a desirable
thing.
(Text):
Hon. Mr. Vien: This is a consolidation of
the act, but we have not an explanatory note
giving particulars of the changes in the existing act. Can the honourable senator give
the reason for that?
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: I am sorry, but I do
not know the reason.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable senator kindiy enlarge on section 64? I have in
mind the National Housing Act, and I note
that section 64(l) (b) of the bill specifies that
the bank may lend money on the security of
a first mortgage if the loan does not exceed
60 per cent of the value of the property on
which the mortgage is taken.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: The section says that
the bank may lend money and make advances
on the security of a first mortgage or hypothec
on improved real or immovable property in
Canada if the loan is authorized by a resolution of the board of directors of the bank,
and the loan does not exceed 60 per cent
of the value of the real or immovable
property. Any insurance company would
lend about the same percentage of the value,
although some would not go as high as 60
per cent and some would be prepared to
lend only 50 or 55 per cent. The bank is
authorized to Iend as much as 60 per cent of
the value of the property, but it is not bound
to go as high as that.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am wondering if a builder
of houses will be able to borrow from the
bank, under the Housing Act, as much as
he could get from a lending institution.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: The answer is yes,
but there are two limitations-the willingness
of the bank to lend, and the percentage it is

allowed to lend. If the builder can keep
within that percentage, I think the bank will
lend.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, before
the bill receives second reading, may I ask if
the intention is to refer it to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Beauregard, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
(COMMONDIPLOMATIC IMMUNITIES
WEALTH COUNTRIES) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. L. M. Gouin moved the second reaiding of Bill 373, an Act to provide diplomatie
and consular immunities for Commonwealth
representatives in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, first I should
like to thank my honourable friend the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for having asked me to move the
second reading of this bill. It is my first
opportunity to assist in my humble way-to
do my wee bit for my distinguished leader
in his parliamentary work which he has
carried so ably and efficiently since the beginning of this session.
It gives me much satisfaction to move the
second reading of this bill which will remove
an anomalous and illogical situation which
exists with regard to the high commissioners
and other representatives of the commonwealth in Canada.
The principle of the bill is very clear,
and I sincerely hope that honourable senators believe as I do that it will contribute
much to the moral unity of our great sisterhood of free nations, our world-wide
commonwealth.
At the present time diplomatic immunities
are not explicitly recognized as applying to
the high commissioners of the commonwealth
countries residing in Ottawa. Not to accord to
the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, for instance, the privileges granted to
any foreign diplomat is in my opinion absurd.
I trust I do not have to insist on that first
point. I may interject that in the other
place all parties unanimously supported this
measure. It has nothing whatever to do with
political partisanship. Even if I were to cross
the floor of this house-as we were informed
yesterday the distinguished senator and LL.D.
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was
erroneously reported in a Winnipeg newspaper to have done-and even if I were
the leader opposite, whom I have no intention

JUNE 9, 1954
of supplanting, I would be just as strongly
in favour of this bill, and perhaps more so.
The purpose of the measure is to grant
formally to commonwealth high commissioners the customary immunities which international law recognizes as applicable to diplomatie agents of foreign states.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask, what are these
immunities?
Hon. Mr. Gouin:. If my honourable friend
will allow me to continue, I shall describe
them precisely in a few minutes. But first I
should like to state that at the present time
such foreign representatives enjoy greater
privileges here than do the representatives of
the commonwealth to which we belong. By
the way, since 1948 the high commissioners
have by virtue of an order in council been
exempted from taxation and custom duties.
These are some of the diplomatie privileges
to which my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) was referring a moment ago.
The bill now under consideration deals with
further diplomatie privileges which I shall
explain briefly.
As honourable senators know, since the
enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in
1931, our commonwealth has become an
absolutely free and voluntary association of
independent and sovereign states enjoying
complete equality of status; and because it
is a free association, it is that much stronger
than if it had any compulsory or rigid
character.
At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers
conference in 1948, it was agreed by resolution that the status of our high commissioners
should be made to conform with that of
foreign ambassadors. In 1952 the United
Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand enacted
legislation in accordance with that resolution.
Other commonwealth countries-I will refer
to them in alphabetical order: Ceylon, India,
Pakistan and the Union of South Africaare now considering bills similar to the one
before us.
I shall attempt, honourable senators, to
explain this short bill clause by clause, and
it will be for the house to decide, after the
bill has received second reading, whether it
should be referred to a committee. Section 3
of the bill lists in alphabetical order-which
is in accordance with what we call international protocol-the seven commonwealth
countries to which the provisions of this
bill will apply.
Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) and also
subsection (2) of section 3 enable the governor in council by proclamation to designate other countries, except of course Canada, in respect of which this bill may apply.
In other words, the bill quite wisely provides

for the eventual admission of additional
members to our great and happy family of
the commonwealth. The members of our
commonwealth are practically unanimous in
doing everything they possibly can to give
greater happiness and freedom to an everincreasing number of people. We all hope that
in the very near future former colonies,
through the gradual process of evolution,
will reach the constitutional stage which we
have now attained. Irrespective of their
colour, race or creed, it will be a great satisfaction for every one of us to welcome such
new members to our family of free and
sovereign nations.
Under subsection (3) of section 3 of the
bill, for them as well as for the present members the diplomatic immunities which I
intend to describe in a moment, are, of
course, based upon the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, if a country to which this bill
applies fails to reciprocate by according to
our high commissioner, or our other Canadian representatives, immunities similar to
those which are provided by this bill, the
governor in council may by proclamation
declare that the immunities in question are
not granted either in toto or partially to representatives of that country.
Section 4 of the bill puts the chief representative-or, as he is known in international
law, the head of the mission-of another
commonwealth country in Canada, upon
exactly the same footing as the "envoy of a
foreign sovereign power accredited" here in
Ottawa. As you all know, a foreign envoy
may have the rank of ambassador, minister,
or chargé d'affaires. At any rate, he is the
head or chief of the mission. Let me remark
here that the process of accrediting diplomats between foreign countries does not
apply, strictly speaking, to representatives
from other parts of the commonwealth. A
foreign ambassador is the personal representative or agent of the head of his own
state. A high commissioner residing in
Canada is the personal representative of the
head of the commonwealth, to which we also
belong. I consider Her Majesty the Queen
as being the Queen of the United Kingdom,
the Queen of Canada, the Queen of Australia,
and of the other parts of the commonwealth.
But it is difficult to imagine that the same
person, even if acting in a different capacity,
can send letters of credence to herself in
order to accredit the representative of one
commonwealth country-say, New Zealand
-to another commonwealth country-say,
Canada. This situation never arose in the
history of the world before the present
development of freedom and sovereignty in
our commonwealth.

SENATE
You all know, honourable senators, that
our great association of free states is neither
a political unit, strictly speaking, nor an
economic unit. Every member country of the
commonwealth is perfectly free in matters
of foreign policy, customs tariffs and every
other matter. The crown, as head of the
commonwealth, is a living symbol of its
unity. This I say with great respect, and
even with reverence. However, in a certain
sense there is only one crown, and thus we
have to find a practical way for giving to
our brothers and associates from the other
parts of the commonwealth the advantages
we have extended to representatives of
foreign countries.
Now I come precisely to the question quite
properly raised by my honourable colleague
frorn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). A foreign
ambassador cannot be arrested, sued in any
civil or criminal matter, or even served with
a subpoena to testify as a witness before our
courts. The residence of a foreign ambassador or envoy is considered as being situated, not in Canada but in the country to
which the ambassador belongs. For this
reason our police cannot be sent to an embassy
to execute a search warrant on the premises
of an embassy. This is what we call the
privilege of exterritoriality, which is freedom
from territorial jurisdiction-in this case,
freedom from Canadian territorial jurisdiction. The only sanction against a foreign
diplomat, as all honourable senators knowand we have had some experience in this
matter-is to ask for his recall and, in
extreme cases, to dismiss him.
Under section 4 of the bill commissioners
from Australia and the other six commonwealth countries will be entitled to the like
immunities from suit and legal process, also
to the like inviolability of residence, official
premises and official archives, as foreign
diplomats are. In other words, the residence
of the High Commissioner of the United
Kingdom or of India, for instance, will be
granted exterritoriality and inviolability.
I come now to the members of the official
staff-clerks, secretaries, counsellors, chancellors and so forth-of a high commissioner
on duty in Canada. The immunities now
recognized here, under customary international law, to the members of the official
staffs of foreign diplomats will by section
5 (1) of the bill be granted to members of
the official staffs of commonwealth high commissioners performing here duties substantially corresponding to those performed by
the staffs of foreign envoys.
As we belong to the same family, the part
played by, for instance, our High Commissioner in London is in a certain sense more

privileged than the part played by a foreign
diplomat. I had the personal experience,
when I was with the armed forces overseas,
of serving in a certain capacity under the
High Commissioner, then the Honourable
Vincent Massey. Of course, he was not a
foreign diplomat. He was much more than
that. He could have entry to Downing street
at any hour of the day or night; and everywhere in London the doors were open to him.
I must say that as a Canadian this was for
me a source of immense satisfaction. I am,
of course, a Canadian of French origin, and
some people may be astonished that I show
so much enthusiasm for British institutions.
But I am exceedingly proud of being a commonwealth citizen. I know that my ancestors
became British subjects by adoption, so to
speak, and that that adoptive process was
carried on by General Wolfe, General Murray
and his Highlanders on the Plains of Abraham. But I am now a member of the family;
and whether or not it is correct for me
to say so, I have no feeling of inferiority.
I am absolutely sure that every Canadian,
whatever his origin, shares to the full my
feelings on this subject.
I come now to the matter of immunities
from suit and legal process granted to members of the families of the high commissioners, their wives and children, and also
the families of the members of their official
staffs. By section 5, subsection (2) we grant,
quite logically, to these persons the same
immunities as those which are granted to
the members of the families of foreign diplomats and members of their staffs.
By section 5, subsection (3) it is intended
to cover the domestic staff-waiters, cooks,
governesses, maids and other employees-of a
commonwealth representative. The domestic
staff of a foreign mission enjoys certain privileges; and I would ask, why should not the
same privileges be granted to the servants
of, for instance, our friend the High Commissioner for Australia or our friend the High
Commissioner for India?
Subsection (4) of the same section is a
"saving" provision. Recently, here and in
committee, we have heard a great deal about
saving clauses. The clause in question is in
no way contentious. It means that if a Canadian becomes a member of the staff of the
high commissioner for another commonwealth
country he will not enjoy those diplomatic
immunities to which I have just referred. A
very dangerous precedent would be created if
anybody-I myself for instance, though I have
no such intention-were to enter, say as a
legal counsellor, the service of a foreign
embassy and thereby escape the civil and

JUNE 9, 1954
criminal jurisdiction of our Canadian laws. I
must say quite frankly in the case of certain
foreign countries that situation would make
me quite apprehensive. Obviously it would
be objectionable if, because I happened to
serve a representative, even the high commissioner, of one of these friendly countries, I
should on this account cease to be a Canadian
citizen subject, like all my fellow Canadians,
to the laws of our land.
In section 6 the attempt is made to cover
what I may call the peculiar character of the
relations between the members of the commonwealth. A trade commissioner, whether
from Great Britain or another commonwealth
country, and certain other officials, have what
I would call a special duty to perform for the
greater benefit of their country and ours.
It was decided that the only way to cover this
somewhat ambiguous and undefined situation
was to enable the Governor General to adopt
orders in council granting to officers of the
high commissioners who perform duties in
substance similar to the duties performed by
certain members of the staff of foreign
diplomats the like immunities from suit and
legal process and the like inviolability of
official archives to those accorded to foreign
consular officials. These establishments of
commonwealth officials are not called consulates. But if I want to travel to, say, India
or Pakistan I must apply to a certain official
in order to make sure that all my passports
and other necessary papers are in proper
form.
Section 7 deals with the question of procedure: how are such immunities to be established before our Canadian courts? By this
section it is provided that we shall follow
the British practice in the case of foreign
diplomats. What will be required is, purely
and simply, a certificate from the Department
of the Secretary of State. Personally I cannot think of a better, more practical or more
efficient mode of making the necessary proof.
By section 8 it is proposed to give to a high
commissioner the faculty enjoyed by a foreign
diplomat to waive, on his own behalf, the
immunities which I have already described.
Suppose he is involved in a minor automobile
accident. He may invoke his right of immunity from any legal process that may develop,
but I respectfully submit that if you appealed
to his common sense he would probably not
object to having the matter decided by a court.
The question involved may not be serious at
all. For instance, the high commissioner may
have parked his car in an illegal parking
zone or his dog may have abused some honourable senator. In any event, the waiving
of immunity is left to the complete discretion
of the high commissioner, and this right also
applies to the members of his family or staff.
83280-37

Section 9 of the bill provides for actions
taken prior to the coming into force of the
act. Officials of the Department of External
Affairs have stated that no case is pending at
the present time, but it is possible that a
case now outside the knowledge of anybody
could develop. In any event, the bill provides that nothing in the act will affect any
action or proceeding commenced prior to the
coming into force of the act. It is not
retroactive.
Honourable senators, I apologize for having
spoken perhaps longer than was necessary,
but before resuming my seat I wish to state
that I personally welcome the legislation
which I have just tried to explain. It marks
another development in the evolution and
progress of that great community of sister
nations known as the commonwealth.
Together we have victoriously withstood two
World Wars. United in times of war, we
continue to co-operate freely and voluntarily.
The crown, as I said before, remains the
living symbol of our unity. At the request
of the Republic of India the expression "Head
of the Commonwealth" was added to the
titles of Her Majesty. Never before in the
history of mankind has a queen become the
head of a confederation including a republic.
It may well be that in the future the commonwealth will contain more than one
republic.
Sometimes foreigners ask us where they
can find the constitution of our commonwealth. A Norman, or perhaps a Scotsman,
could answer: "You find it nowhere-and
that means everywhere." No such constitution is recorded in any statute book. It is a
spiritual bond, an immaterial tie, an ideal
enshrined in the hearts of about one-quarter
of the human race. It is an ideal of freedom
and fair play; it is the democratic system of
the rule of law; it is faith in justice and
toleration. The commonwealth believes in
peace, hopes for peace, and loves peace.
I recall to mind now the following words
from the Gospel of St. John, chapter 14,
verse 27, which were read three days ago
on Whit Sunday or Pentecost, one of the
most solemn feasts for all Christians:
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto

you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled. neither let it be
afraid.

As a symbol of peace and stability, the
crown spiritually unites all members of the
commonwealth. Whatever may be our racial
origin or religious belief, we are all serving
together as well as we can in the sacred
cause of peace and human progress. The
peaceful and efficient influence of our vast
community of free nations is more and more

Hon. Mr. Gouin: In answer to my honourable friend, I would say that the present
tendency is to limit the immunities to such
as are strictly necessary for the proper exercise of the functions of an ambassador. We

Canada has five representatives in Soviet
Russia, but Soviet Russia bas sixteen in Canada-not counting the doormen, cooks and
bottle washers. If Soviet Russia sought trade
relations with Canada I could see the reason
for so many representatives. I can understand Great Britain and the United States
maintaining a group of representatives for
the purpose of fostering trade, and I can
understand both those countries and Canada
having military representatives in their
legations or embassies in order to co-operate
in matters of defence. One may draw one's
own conclusions as to why Soviet Russia bas
so many representatives in Canada.
Honourable senators, I repeat that I think
we are going too far in the granting of
immunities to commonwealth representatives.
May I add that I am somewhat intrigued by
section 8 of the bill, which gives the right to
waive any immunity. I cannot imagine anybody waiving any rights under this legislation.
I do not think the bill should be rushed
through, as its sponsor seems to wish. It
should be given further consideration before
receiving third reading. I want more information than bas been given this afternoon,
and I therefore suggest that the bill be
referred to a committee.

to me that if the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who is to explain
this bill, is prepared to proceed this afternoon, it would be possible to consider it in

Hon. Mr. Haig: The objection to that suggestion is that the honourable senator from

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 448, an Act to amend the
Excise Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill 448
amends the Excise Act, which is Chapter 99 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada. This act,
which has been on the statute books for many
years, was formerly known as the Inland
Revenue Act. I think it might be of value
to say something of the nature of the act itself
before coming to the amendments.

By this act excise duty is imposed upon
distilled spirits, beer or malt liquor, spirits
used in the manufacture of goods in bond,
tobacco and cigars manufactured in Canada,
and Canadian raw leaf tobacco. The rates
are those set out in a simple schedule at
the end of the act. The act itself is lengthy,
comprising some 261 sections, as well as
the schedules which set the level of tax.
The general sections deal with such matters
as licences, the keeping of books of accounts,
rates, bonding and warehousing, the powers
of enforcement and offences, penalties, seizures
and forfeitures.
Honourable senators will appreciate that
the act, which is rather far-reaching, must
be very meticulously drawn, because it is
one of the important measures whereby the
crown secures its revenue. I am informed
that the excise duty collected in the fiscal
year 1953-54 amounted to $249,697,000. The
matter of policing the provisions of the act
in order to assure the collection of revenue,
and to prevent escape from the provisions of
the act, requires an elaborate legislative structure. I may say also that the tax under this
act, which is an excise duty, is a tax on goods
and is collected at the manufacturers' level.
The effect of the amendment is rather
simple. The principal sections affected are
172 and 173, and schedules III and IV of the
act, with reference to beer. At the present
time ail beer or malt liquor brewed from
substances other than malt attract a tax of
some 42 cents a gallon; and all malt brought
into breweries for the purpose of making
malt beer is taxed at the rate of 21 cents a
pound.
It is proposed by the amendments, first,
to abandon the poundage method of tax;
second, to adopt the gallonage method of tax,
and to make a uniform gallonage tax for all
beer, whether it is brewed from malt alone
or from malt and other substances like brewers' corn flakes, corn adjuncts and the like.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And rice.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, and rice. Malt
beer is now taxed on a poundage basis at the
rate of 21 cents a pound. I am informed that
it requires about two pounds of malt to produce a gallon of malt beer. For beer produced from malt and other substances the tax
now is 42 cents a gallon. But that beer, I am
informed, constitutes only 6 per cent of the
total quantity of beer produced in this country. Due to modern production methodsand that is the only explanation I have been
given-it is now possible to produce a gallon
of malt beer with a little less than two pounds
-approximately 1-8 pounds-of malt. Therefore there is some tax discrimination in favour

JUNE 9, 1954

of beer produced from malt and beer produced from substances other than malt with,
of course, malt included. It is now proposed to
levy a tax of thirty-eight cents on a gallonage
basis on all beer. This would also appear
to have some measure of fairness for the
producers of corn, in that there is a reduction in tax from 42 cents to 38 cents on the
type of beer for which they supplied some of
the ingredients. I am informed, however,
that there is no anticipated reduction in the
revenue.
There is another small amendment. Sections 171 and 176 are amended as to the labelling requirements and these requirements,
for beer, are now to be regulated and prescribed by order in council. Formerly they
were contained in the act and were found
to be rather rigid. I am informed that the
department has had a rather satisfactory set
of regulations working in connection with
labelling for the distilling industry and it is
proposed to make the same regulations
applicable, mutatis mutandis perhaps I should
say, to the brewing industry.
There is another section in the amending
bill requiring penalties to be applied for failure to comply with measuring requirements
on the computation of tax.
So, honourable senators, to summarize the
provisions of the amending bill, may I say
that, generally, the purpose of the amendments is to provide a lower rate of tax and
a new method of computing the tax, and
there are mechanical changes in the act consequent upon the imposition of this new tax
on the gallonage basis.
Section 2 provides a minor amendment in
cases of drawbacks of duty on exported beer.
Section 3 provides for regulations to ensure
compliance by the brewing industry with
the provisions of the act. Section 4 provides
penalties for failure to comply with the act
or regulations.
Section 5 amends the
schedules in the manner I have described.
Section 6 simply says that the act shall be
deemed to have become effective on April 7,
1954.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I am completely in the hands of the house.
Perhaps this particular bill need not go to
committee; I was going to suggest that we
have third reading at the next sitting. If
any honourable senator would like it to go
to committee for further explanation, I have
no objection.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Next sitting.

DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
a few minutes ago we were discussing the
question of the distribution of bills. I have
been perusing the Rules of the Senate of
Canada and I do not find any provision that
a bill must be distributed at least twentyfour hours before it is considered. It was
not a provision in the House of Commons
Rules while I was there, and I was rather
surprised to hear it suggested that such a
provision was in ours. I am not going to
suggest that the second reading of these bills
which have not been distributed should be
proceeded with today, but I do say that I
can find no provision in the rules which
would make it irregular to do so.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the practice of this house in the past has
been never to call a bill for second reading
if copies of it have not been distributed. To
call the order for the second reading of a bill
only ten minutes after a copy is placed on
our files is, I say, pretty fast work. I would
like at least twenty-four hours to read bills
like these. In all my experience I have
never seen a bill pushed through the house
before being distributed to our desks in sufficient time for everybody to read and study
it. Surely that is the least that can be done,
regardless of the rules. In the Legislature
cf Manitoba, where I sat for a number of
years, we never had to contend with a condition like this. Now, if it is the intention
of the government to put these bills through
for second reading today under the circumstances I have mentioned I cannot help it,
but I say that is not a proper way to deal
with legislation.
Furthermore, I am positive that the Senate
would receive a very severe reprimand from
the people of Canada if it were known that we
allowed the government to force bills on for
second reading only a few minutes after
they were distributed. If we allowed that
to happen we would be shirking our responsibility as a chamber of sober second thought,
where legislation should be given careful consideration. That procedure smacks neither
of second thought nor sober consideration.
For instance, there is on the order paper a
bill authorizing the Canadian National Railways to make capital expenditures involving some $334 million, and yet that bill was
distributed not many minutes ago. Fortunately, as Leader of the Opposition, I was
sent a copy of the bill as soon as it was
introduced in the House of Commons, and I
read it, but I do not think that applies to
other members of the house. As my honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Vien) said, it was only after some difficulty

SENATE
that he was able to secure a copy of the bill
to amend the Income Tax Act, which is
also on the order paper. I must admit I
have had a copy of it myself for three or four
days. It would be unfair to ask the house
to consider bills that have just been distributed in the chamber but, as I say, if that
is what is going to be done I cannot help it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think I said in my
opening remarks at this stage of the discussion that it was not my intention to suggest
that these bills be considered at this time,
if there was any objection. I did, however, wish
to draw to the attention of the house the fact
that there is no rule to the effect that a bill
must be distributed twenty-four hours before
it is considered. I do not think the Leader

of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) would have
had any objection whatsoever to our proceeding with the second readings if these
bills had been distributed this morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I do not think I would
have.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: For that reason I let
it be known that there is no twenty-four hour
rule as to distribution of bills.
I want to assure my honourable friend the
Leader of the Opposition that there is no
desire on my part to have the house consider any legislation before the house is
prepared and sufficiently informed to do so.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED
POLICE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move that they be concurred in now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the hurry?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
these amendments are formal in one sense.
The first one simply means that under the
new Bank Act the banks would have the
option of establishing whatever method they
preferred for the transfer of their shares.
Heretofore the shares could only be transferred on the books of the company, but this
amendment would incorporate in the Bank
Act the provisions in the Companies Act of
Canada dealing with methods of transfer. The
second amendment simply strikes out one
line in the form in Schedule L. This change
does not impair the security of the bank
at all, and it relieves the borrower from
possible additional expense and possible additional paper work in connection with loans
on oil in or upon the ground or otherwise.
The motion was agreed to and the amendments were concurred in.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill,
as amended, be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Next sitting.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant

JUNE 10, 1954
On the form that the bill was returned
here the last time, the House of Commons
had changed the provisions governing
appeals and had p-ovided for an appeal both
from conviction and sentence, whether the
contempt was committed in the face of the
court or otherwise; but this right was expressed not to be absolute, but only with leave
of the court of appeal or a judge of the court
of appeal. We debated this change in this
chamber and considered it again in committee; we heard representations from the
Minister of Justice; and the report of your
committee is that the position which we
originally took is the sound one. We have
therefore restored the appeal provision with
respect to contempt which we originally
incorporated in the bill.
The second item is an amendment of section 25 of the bill. This amendment was
inserted at the request of the Department of
Justice. The law as it is contains a provision, which has been in the Code for a
very long time, whereunder a police officer
may use such force as is necessary in the
apprehension or to prevent the escape of a
person who is suspected of having committed
an offence for which he may be arrested
without warrant, the only restriction being
that he must not employ more violence than
is necessary to accomplish the arrest or prevent the escape. For some reason or other
this was omitted in the draft bill of the
Criminal Code Revision Commission, and in
subsequent redrafts by parliament. The
Senate committee, which was asked to insert
it, discussed the matter at length, and at the
request of one of our members the item
even stood over for a number of days.
Finally the Minister of Justice made his
representations on it, and the committee
decided to incorporate it in section 25.
The third amendment has to do with section 68, dealing with the reading of proclamations in connection with riots. In the
way in which the section was drafted it
appeared that if a justice, mayor or sheriff
or the lawful deputy of a mayor or sheriff
received notice of a riot, the section was
mandatory: the mayor or official in question
was required to proceed to the place where
the unlawful assembly was supposed to be
taking place and read the riot act. It
appeared to many senators that, notwithstanding other provisions in the act, there
was no discretionary power, and that a
situation might occur where the mayor or
official, after receiving notice of an unlawful assembly, might get to the place and find
a very peaceful gathering. Our amendment
provides that when the justice, mayor or
sheriff or the lawful deputy of a mayor or
83280-38

sheriff proceeds to the place where persons
are supposed to be unlawfully and riotously
assembled, he is to satisfy himself that a riot
is in fact in progress before he proceeds to
read the riot act.
The fourth amendment made by the committee is in connection with the seizure of
telephone equipment in a betting house. Section 171 contains an exception which prevents police officers from seizing and destroying telephone equipment in a betting house.
But in the complementary section, section 431,
persons executing a warrant may seize and
detain materials and equipment suspected
to be used in the commission of an offence.
The exception provided for in section 171
apparently had not been carried through to
section 431, and in order to make the law
abundantly clear we have amended the bill
so as to ensure that the exception against
this seizure of telephone equipment applies
to both sections 171 and 431.
At the request of the department the committee made an amendment to section 178,
dealing with pari-mutuel betting.
Several amendments were proposed by the
department in connection with section 400,
dealing with the printing of circulars, et
cetera, in likeness of notes. The amendments
have to do with the kind of offences that
would be involved, and they have been incorporated in section 400.
Another amendment has to do with the
question of habeas corpus. In sections 690
and 691 of the bill as it came before our
committee there was provision for a hearing,
in connection with habeas corpus proceedings
on the merits, and then a right of appeal.
Under the present law a person may apply
for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground
that there is no legal basis for his detention
in custody. As the law now stands, if I were
instructed on behalf of some person who
thought he was so illegahly detained I could
apply to any judge of the Supreme Court of
Ontario and ask him for a writ of habeas
corpus. If he granted it the writ would be
delivered to the jailer, and the jailer would
be instructed, under that writ, to deliver
up the body of the man detained at a certain
day, in order that the question of whether the
man was or was not being held legally in
custody might be determined. If the judge
refused to grant me the writ, I could go to
other judges who might be available until
I might find one who felt there was some
merit in the application, or that there was an
issue which should be inquired into; and my
rights of appeal in that sense would fail
only when I had exhausted the number of
judges who were available.

SENATE

The committee gave serious consideration
to the amendments in the bill, and the opinion
of the majority of the members-it was almost
a unanimous opinion-was that the present
procedure should be continued, and that the
proposed new procedure should not be adopted, particularly that providing for an appeal
after the first refusal by a judge. Under the
appeal provision, even if a judge granted the
writ of habeas corpus, the crown would have
a right of appeal, in which case there would
be a delay of seven days, for that would be
the earliest time at which the appeal could
be heard. On the appeal, if it was decided
that the man was illegally detained he would
have spent that much longer time in illegal
detention. We finally concluded that if any
judge of the Supreme Court decided there was
something to inquire into, the inquiry should
go ahead and should not be interfered with
by giving the crown a right of appeal at that
stage, when all that a judge has to determine
is: "On the facts presented to me, is there
anything on which there should be some
inquiry to determine whether or not the man
The judge
bas been illegally detained?"
makes that decision.
The other amendments relate to the French
translation of the bill. Apparently some question arose as to the use in certain sections of
the proper French word to describe the particular offence, and in some instances members of the committee who are very familiar
with the French terminology felt that in some
sections the translator had not used the
precise word to describe in French the particular offence dealt with in the English
text. A number of amendments were passed
to correct that situation.
In substance, those are all the amendments
I need to deal with now. I wish to add that
it is a source of satisfaction that we have the
Code in its present form possibly on the last
leg of its journey, so to speak, toward enactment. This result bas been achieved after the
bill has been in committee on three different
occasions and considerable time has been
spent in reviewing and studying its provisions, and changing them where we thought
it necessary.
Although this bill may be passed and
become law, I am not too hopeful that no
further amendments to the Code will be
required from year to year. We may think
that certain sections are perfect, but in actual
practice, when one runs up against a particular case and it is necessary to apply the law,
defects or weaknesses in drafting are often
revealed, and it is found that a provision has
not been sufficiently expended or narrowed.

Before I take my seat, I want to express
my gratitude to the members of the subcommittee and of the main committee that
worked on this bill and helped to expedite
the bringing of it to the present stage.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill as amended be read the
third time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, we have heard the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) explain the
amendments very fully. The bill has received
very careful consideration both from the
committee to which the bill was referred and
from this house. It now becomes necessary
for the House of Commons to consider our
amendments.
If honourable senators are
agreeable I will move that the bill be read
the third time now, so that it may be returned
to the House of Commons today.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I concur in what the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said. This
is the most important piece of legislation that
the Senate has had to deal with in recent
years. A considerable amount of work was
devoted to the revision of the Code in two
previous sessions, as well as in this one, and
when the bill becomes law a very real
advance in Canadian criminal jurisprudence
will have been made. I think that through
its work on this bill the Senate has done
itself great credit. In saying so, I am not
speaking of myself, but rather in particular
of those four or five members who did so
much work on the original bill. I wish to
pay a special tribute to the chairman of the
committee to which this bill was referred
He rendered great
(Hon. Mr. Hayden).
service.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I pay this tribute to him
not only because of his outstanding legal
ability but because of the courteous way in
which he treated every one of us, even though
we did not agree with all his proposals. I
appreciate what he said about the possibility
of future amendments to the Code. We cannot expect any legislation to be perfect, and
from time to time after this law bas been
tested in the courts some amendments will
no doubt be found necessary. While I am a
lawyer I have not had a great deal of experience in criminal practice and am not an
authority on the subject. However, I can

JUNE 10, 1954
assure the house that in the consideration of
this bill in committee every attempt was
made to give the benefit of any doubt to an
accused person and to ensure that an innocent
person would not be deprived of his freedom.
Historically speaking, this has been an
interesting piece of legislation. The original
bill that came to us was drafted by the
Criminal Code Revision Commission, and
while I do not direct any criticism at the
members of the commission it can be said
they were people who had been engaged more
or less on the crown's side of the law. When
that early bill came before the subcommittee
of our Committee on Banking and Commerce
it was considered by men who for the most
part had been on the side of the defence.
Obviously, after years of experience along a
certain line, one forms his own ideas of
things.
Speaking for the members of the committee
which passed upon the bill now before us, I
can say that the bill is the embodiment of
British justice. I feel sure that it represents
a great advance in criminal law, and that in
the years to come senators will stand up in
this bouse and pay tribute to the men and
women of the Senate of 1951-54 for the
service they rendered in helping the Parliament of Canada to enact a reasonably sound
criminal code.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
as amended was read the third time, and
passed.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that when this house rises today it
stand adjourned until Tuesday next at 3 p.m.
I would remind honourable senators that,
in accordance with the notice read by His
Honour the Speaker, Royal Assent will take
place at 5.45 this afternoon, and the whips are
anxious to have as many senators in attendance as possible.
FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN CIVIL SERVICE
INQUIRY

AND ANSWER

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson inquired of
the government:1. What was the number of permanent and temporary female employees in the Federal Civil Service, as of October 31, 1953?
2. How many of these employed women are
single?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer to the
first question asked by the honourable senator
is as follows:
1. As of October 31, 1953, there were in the government service of Canada 30,389 women of whom
23,149
were
temporary and 7,240 permanent
employees.

The second question asked by the honourable senator is not as easily answered. I
regret to say that I have been unable to
obtain the information requested.
Hon. Mr. Howard: We want to know.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
perhaps I worded my second question awkwardly, but I thought that the Civil Service
kept a record of the status of their employees.

The purpose of this bill is set out fully in
the explanatory note to the bill, as follows:
Section 235 of the Criminal Code relates to the
circumstances in which pari-mutuel betting may
be lawfully conducted in connection with race

ensure that a racing association that has been
incorporated in one province shall not be entitled
to conduct race meetings, with pari-mutuel betting,
on race tracks that it acquires in another province.

INCOME TAX BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Saller A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 467, an act to amend the
Income Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, there are
some twenty-two pages of amendments to the
Income Tax Act in the bill before us and from
a study of these amendments and our general
observation of things I think we can safely
conclude that we cannot expect in the near
future much if anything, in the way of
income tax reductions. Some of the proposed amendments are relieving in the beneficial sense of the word, while in other aspects
the amendments are intended to close loopholes in the present law. Still others are
meant to deal with situations that have
developed as the result of enactments made
in previous years where the use being made
of those enactments has increased to such
an extent that the department thought the
provisions should be tightened up. That is
all I have to say of a general nature. In
explaining the Income Tax Bill last session,
I adopted the practice of dealing with it
section by section, and as that seemed to
meet with a good reception I think I should
try it once again. So I propose to deal with
this bill section by section, indicating what
the purpose of each amendment is and, where
necessary, what the present law is.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: How many acts relating
to income tax have we now?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: We have the present
Income Tax Act, which is in the Revised
Statutes of 1952, and the Income Tax Act of
1948, and the Income Tax Acts for the period
1949 to 1952, to the consolidation; and, in
addition, the Income War Tax Act, which
had no further prospective application after
1948. Those various statutes that have to
be carried along for some time because we
are still dealing in an assessing way with the
rights of people under them.
Section 1 of the bill contains an error that
can be corrected in committee. It refers to
subsection (1) of section 6 of the Income Tax
Act, but there is no such subsection. However,
a new paragraph is added to section 6 to deal
with the sort of situation that has developed
under section 20 (5) (c) (iv) of the act, which
provides that where proceeds of a fire insurance policy are received they shall form part
of what is termed proceeds of a disposition.
That sounds somewhat complicated, but what
it means is that the elaborate method of
depreciating property called depreciated capital cost which was set up some years ago
provided for recapture of all the depreciation
allowed if you realize more than the balance
of the undepreciated capital cost.
The general law in connection with the
proceeds of fire insurance is that they form
part of the so-called proceeds of a disposition
and in the ordinary way would be deducted
from capital account. But there is an exception in the present law which says that shall
not happen to the extent that the amount
recovered by nire insurance has been used
within a reasonable time for the purpose of
repairing the damage. I will now state what
the amendment does. You recover fire insurance moneys as the result of damage to
property, and in the first instance that may
be proceeds of a disposition so that your
capital account would be reduced by that
amount and if there is any recapture it would
apply, but then if you spend the money "(i)
within the year, and (ii) within a reasonable
time after the damage, on repairing the
damage," then to that extent the amount
spent is added back to your capital account,
your proceeds of a disposition are reduced,
you have an item of income in that year to
the amount spent, and you have an item of
expense. That is the manner of the bookkeeping.
Let me give an example. Say my only
capital asset is a property and the cost was
$5,000. I have a fire which damages the
property to the extent that I recover insurance proceeds amounting to $3,000. My capital
account has then become $5,000, less $3,000,
so my undepreciated capital cost would be
$2,000. Assuming that within a reasonable

JUNE 10, 1954
Urne I spend $1,000 on repairs, then my proceeds of disposition, being the $3,000 received
as insurance, are reduced to $2,000, and my
capital account is increased from $2,000 to
$3,000. 1 put $1,000 into income account for
the year and I match that with $1,000 for
expenses. That is in fact the way the transaction works out.
It seems to me that under the law as it is
now in section 20 (5) (c) (iv), that could have
been accomplished by means of regulations,
instead of by as an amendment to the act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You stili have $2,000.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As you spend the rest
of the money within a reasonable Urne on
repairing the damage, then your capital
account is restored by the amount you spend.
Hon. Mr. Aseirine:
spend it?

But if you do not

Hon. Mr. Hayden: if you do not spend it,
it forms the proceeds of a disposition, and
if you are subject to recaptureHon. Mr. Aseltine: Then, would you have
to pay income tax on it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ICinley: Would that apply if the
building was completely destroyed and a new
one is built on the sanie site?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That wouid flot be
repairing the damage.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No, but you received
insurance for the oid building.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would flot be the
proceeds of insurance. That wouid be proceeds of a disposition and they would equal
the undepreciated capital costs on your capital account at that time. Your capital accouti
would be wiped out and this accretion of the
proceeds would go into your capital and
would be used again ta put Up a building.
By section 2 of the bill it is proposed to
amend section il of the act, which deals
with the deductions that are ailowed in computing income, and interest on borrowed
money used for the purpose of earning
income is a proper item of deduction, but the
wording in the section was unfortunate and
this amendment clarifies that wording. AUl
I have to do is to read the present section
to show that the wording is unfortunate.
Section i1, (1) (c) says:
Deductions allowed in computing Incorne(c) an amount pald in the year or payable in
respect of the year (depending upon the method
regulariy followed by thxe taxpayer in computing
bis incarne), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay
interest on

(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of
earning income from a business or property (other
than property the income from which would be
exempt).

The amendment
interest on:

permits

deduction

of

W1 borrowed rnoney used for the purpose of
earning incarne fromn a business or property (other
than borrowed maney used to acquire property the
income f rom which would be exempt).

Of course, what the departmental officiais
were trying ta get at there was this kind of
situation: if you operated a business and borrowed money to buy shares in another company, the dividends on those shares passing
into your company would flot attract any
tax. But, as I said, the wording was unfortunate. What it says now is, if you operate
a limited company and borrow money to buy
shares in another company you are going to
be allowed a deductible item of interest.
What is being dealt with is, when to deduct
and when not to deduct interest on borrowed
money. Deduction is permissible if the borrowed money is used ta earn income; it is
flot permissible if the borrowed money is
used ta acquire assets and the income from.
those assets is flot taxable income.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If you buy shares in
another ýCanadian company you deduct only
20 per cent on your income tax return.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. If I have a campany
and buy shares in another Canadian company, the dividend from the cOMDany in
which I invest passes to the first company
without any tax on it.
The next amendment, appearing at the
battomn of page 1, is paragraph (ca), which is
added to subsection (1) of section il of the
act. It provides that when, because of arrears
in payment of interest it becomes necessary
ta pay interest on that interest, the interest
s0 paid on overdue interest is allowed as a
deduction, as well as the interest itseif.
The next amendment in section 2 is subsection (3), which relates to subparagraph (i)
of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section
il of the act. It simply repeats in respect of
interest the same language I have already
quoted in dealing with the earlier amendment,
and it deals with the situation where a persan
is in receipt of a payment which is a combined interest and principal; and it depends
on the character of that interest, and in
respect of what it is being received, whether
it should be a deductible item or not. All
that is done is to change the wording of the
section in the same way as I have described
in relation to the previous amendment.
Subsections (4) and (5) implement budget
resolution No. 5 in dealing with contributions
by employers and employees to an approved

SENATE
pension plan. Hitherto the amount of the
contribution which was permitted to be made
without attracting the tax was $900: that is,
the employer could contribute up to $900
te an approved pension plan in any year
in respect of each of his employees, and the
employee could contribute the like amount,
and those contributions did not attract a tax.
Now, in each case-implementing budget resolution No. 5-the amount bas been increased
to $1,500.
Dy subsection (6), section 11 is amended by
adding subsections (3a), (3b) and (3c). The
purpose is this. If you borrow money at a
discount, you take the face amount of the
note which is discounted as being the amount
really borrowed, and then if some of the
money is used in the business to earn income,
and some is used for purposes for which
you would not be entitled to deduct the interest, how are you going to ascertain what
part of this amount is referable to business
which is earning income? This section spells
it out thus, that you ascertain how much of
the money received is actually used in the
business, to earn income, and then figure the
proportion to the whole amount actually received; and the percentage of the face value of
the note is regarded as being the money which
is actually borrowed for the purposes
described in the act.
There is aiso in subsection (3b) a declaration that money borrowed to repay money
borrowed shall be regarded as having been
borrowed for the same purpose as the original
borrowing. Once the character of the original
borrowing is determined, the money borrowed
to repay the original loan takes the same
character.
Subsection (3c) provoked a lot of debate in
the Commons. Frankly, I believe there must
have been a good deal of confusion in connection with the discussion of it, because the
provision is very plain. It deals with the
situation of a teacher who has made contributions to an approved pension plan and
retires to enter Her Majesty's service or to
work for some organization in respect of
which his taxable income is entitled to
exemption by virtue of section 62 of the act.
Later, he goes back to his earlier employment and wants to qualify for the pension
plan and make contributions in respect of
past service. The wording of the law as it
stands means that, since be had been under
the plan and had made contributions for past
service before he left his employment as a
teacher, be could not make deductions of
payments made in respect of past services.
Subsection (3c) simply says that, notwithstanding these circumstances, be shall qualify
to make such deductions.

Hon. Mr. Aseline: Is that for the purpose
of overcoming the present teacher shortage?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I could not say that it
is for that purpose, though I think it might
be a factor in influencing some teachers who
have left the teaching profession to go back
to it.
Subsection (7) is intended to deal with the
following situation. Under the present law,
if an employer contributes more than $900
a year to an approved pension plan he can
deduct in respect only of that amount, but
he is permitted to carry the excess over to
the next year, so he may catch a year in
which he is not able to contribute in excess
of $900. This is changed by the amendment,
and the limitation of $900 is struck out, so
that the new limitation will be $1,500.
Subsection (8) of the bill repeals paragraph
(c) of subsection (9) of section 11 of the act
and substitutes a new paragraph (c). The
purpose of the amendment is simply to correct an omission that was made in the
previous drafting. A comparison of the proposed paragraph (c) with paragraph (c) now
in the act discloses that the latter omitted
reference to subparagraph "(vi)" in connection with section 5 of the act. Section
5tb)(vi) of the act provides that reasonable
allowances received by a minister or clergyman for transportation expenses incidental
to the discharge of their duties is exempt
from income tax. The amendment makes it
clear that a clergyman who receives an
allowance for transportation which is excluded
from income by reason of section 5 of the
act, may not also claim a deduction under
section 11 of the act for travelling expenses.
In other words, the object of the amendment
is to prevent a minister or clergyman, when
computing his income tax, from including
travelling costs as an item of expense under
section 5 when he is claiming this item as a
deduction under section 11. In short, it is to
prevent the taxpayer from receiving a double
benefit.
I wish to deal next with subsection (9)
of section 2 of the bill, which was given
thorough study in the other bouse. This
amendment, which introduces a new subsection, bas to do with the travelling expenses
of certain employees that may be deducted
for income tax purposes. As honourable
senators may know, salesmen and other employees who move about in the course of
their employment have been permitted to
deduct the cost of their meals as an item of
travelling expenses. This right bas been
abused to such an extent that the depart-

JUNE 10, 1954
mental officials deemed it advisable to close
the apparent loophole in the act. A great
number of meals have been charged by employees who have not even moved beyond
their municipality or metropolitan area in
which their employers' plants have been
located. Such employees as milkmen, when
computing their income tax, have been
deducting the cost of their lunches. The
department has decided that the substantial
majority of Canada's employees buy their
lunches out of their own personal funds, and
that therefore the cost of these meals should
not be deductible for income tax purposes.
This new subsection (9a) provides that salesmen or other employees who are permitted by
subsections (6) and (9) of section 11 of the
act to deduct travelling expenses incurred in
earning their income, may not deduct the cost
of their meals unless they are away for a
period of at least twelve hours from the
municipality or the metropolitan area where
their employer's plant is located.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about entertaining
business guests at home?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is an entirely
different matter. It is perfectly all right if
an employer wants to assume responsibility
for the payment of such meals, and he may
charge them up as an entertainment expense
to be dealt with under another part of the
act. However, that does not enter into the
consideration of the item now before the
house.
Subsection (10) amends section 11 of the
act by adding immediately after subsection
(11) thereof a new subsection (lia). Subsection (11) of section 11 of the act provides
that under certain circumstances a deduction
may be made with respect to the capital cost
to a taxpayer of an automobile used in the
performance of his duties. The departmental
officials felt that this was another provision
that was being abused, so there has been
inserted a new subsection which provides
that capital cost allowances deducted by a
taxpayer in respect of an automobile used in
the performance of the duties of his office or
employment shall be subject to recapture in
the event that the automobile is ultimately
sold for more than the then undepreciated
capital cost of the automobile.
Section 3 of the bill speaks for itself, so I
need not spend any time on it. It merely
corrects a typographical error made in the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952.
Section 4 revises section 18 of the act,
which deals with lease-option agreements
and hire-purchase agreements. If under a
lease-option agreement you lease property

with the option of buying it, then for the
purposes of computing income tax you may
regard any so-called rental payments as payments on account of the purchase price and
not as rent. A loophole was apparently discovered in the operation of section 18 of the
act, and the amendment I am dealing with
has been designed to plug that loophole.
The lease-option provision now in the act
applies where the option is given, not to the
lessee, but to a third person with whom the
lessee is not dealing at arm's length. In
other words, this simple expedient has been
taken: "Oh, yes, I will make a leasing
agreement with you and with my brother.
You can give him an option so that he can
buy the property." In this way attempts
have been made to avoid the application of
section 18. This amendment closes that gap
and provides the rules that are to be applied
in respect of capital cost allowances when a
lease has been taken by one person and the
option taken by a third person who is not
at arm's length in relationship to the lessee.
Section 5 provides new rules for adjusting
the depreciation account when the proportion
of a property used for producing income is
changed. Let me give an illustration. Suppose a man owns a double house and rents
both parts of it, but later decides to take
over the occupancy of one-half, so that only
the other half remains rented. That portion
only would be subject to capital cost allowance, and the income from the rent would of
course be subject to income tax.
The provisions of the present law are
cumbersome with respect to determining
capital cost allowance when the proportion
of a property used for producing income is
changed. For purposes of computation it
is presumed that the whole property is sold
for its fair market value and that the part
that produces income is bought back at the
fair market value, and that represents the
value which is used for capital cost allowances thereafter. A direct approach is now
made to the problem, and you simply determine the fair market value of the part of
the property with respect to which the change
takes place.
The next amendment is in section 5 (1) (g)
of the bill, and this deals with bulk sales.
In a bulk sale there may be depreciable
assets and assets which are not depreciable.
The question is, how is the allocation made
for the purposes of determining the basis of
value for depreciation? Parapragh
(g)
answers that question. Under the present
law there is no rule describing the purchaser's
position in a bulk sale transaction. The

Section 9, which appears on page 8 of the
bill, amends section 39 of the act, wherein
it is provided that corporations are entitled
to a tax rate of 18 per cent plus 2 per cent
on the first $20,000 of their earnings. But
that section in the act further provides that
if you have a series of companies, only one
may get the benefit of the 20 per cent rate
on the first $20,000. Since a principle laid
down later in this bill reserves the use of
the words "related to" for transactions which
may be said to be at arm's length or not at
arm's length, it was decided that, in order
to avoid confusion, the words "associated
with" should be used in connection with companies entitled to the 20 per cent rate. The
section provides certain conditions which are
self-explanatory.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: In the case of several
companies, is the taxpayer entitled to select
which of his companies should receive the 20
per cent rate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I will answer my honourable friend by saying: if the parties can agree,
that is fine; but if they cannot agree, the
Minister determines which company shall
receive it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask a second question? If the taxpayer selects company A to
receive the benefit in 1953, is he entitled to
select company B in 1954?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I know of nothing in the
act which prohibits his doing so; but,- after
all, he is entitled to 20 per cent on only
the first $20,000 of earnings. However, I can
visualize a situation in which one company
might have less than $20,000 earnings in one
year, and obviously it would be more beneficial to give the 20 per cent rate to a company
which could take the full benefit of it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think that hole
has been plugged yet.
I turn next to section 10 of the bill, having
to do with what is called "farmer averaging".
Honourable senators are familiar with section
42 of the act which provides that for taxation
purposes farmers and fishermen may average
their income over a five-year period. As the
section now stands, the taxpayer may carry
a loss back one year or forward five years,
and average his income every five years.
But with regard to averaging income over
five years for the purpose of determining the
rate of tax payable each year, section 42 did
not clearly state whether the taxpayer was
entitled to include in his list for averaging
purposes a year in which he had no income
or suffered a loss. There was a question

whether he was entitled to reduce his average
by taking into account a loss in any one year.
Section 10 of the bill is a relieving section,
and I shall explain it by giving an illustration. Let us suppose a farmer had a profit
of $2,000 for four years and suffered a loss of
$4,000 in the fifth year. Under the present
law he could carry back the loss only one
year, which means he could carry back $2,000
of his loss, and the remaining $2,000 he
would carry forward. In other words, he is
not able to use the whole loss to reduce his
average for the five-year period. The proposed amendment would allow him to take
into account his whole $4,000 loss for the
purposes of averaging his income over the
five-year period. The section goes on to say,
of course, that, having used up his loss in
that five-year period, he cannot carry it
forward into the first year of the next fiveyear period. To that extent the section is
relieving.
I should also point out that the definition
of what may be included in farmers' income
bas been enlarged. If honourable senators will
refer to the bottom of page 8 and the top
of page 9 of the bill, where new subsections
(6) and (7) are added to section 42 of the
act, they will see there the definition is
enlarged to include, for instance, rent received
from farm property and also money received
for what is called "share cropping."
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has that not always
been the case?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Apparently not, because
this definition expands the provision.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We have always included it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I imagine you were anticipating the change in the law.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In Saskatchewan they "get
away with murder".
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do the words "farming
or fishing" mean farming and fishing? I have
in mind the farmers in my part of the country
who. do a considerable amount of fishing in
certain seasons of the year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It reads "farming or
fishing", but if a taxpayer does both it may
be interpreted to mean "farming and fishing".
Section 11 would amend section 50 of
the act which has to do with payment of
tax by corporations. I shall deal quickly
with this action, by saying that at the present
time corporations may pay their income tax
on an estimated basis by instalments. In the
last six months of the fiscal year they pay
one-twelfth of the tax in each month, onesixth of the balance in each of the next five

SENATE
months and the remainder when they file
their return. The difficulty there is that half
of the payments are on an estimated basis,
and the balance are on an actual basis. This
amendment, which is relieving, would extend
by three months the time in which a company
may pay instalments of tax on an estimated
basis. That means that the company would
pay tax on an estimated basis for the last six
months of the fiscal year and the following
three months, a total of nine months, and
the balance upon the filing of the return. It
is a relieving section for corporations.
Sections 12 and 13 of the bill deal with
business losses. Section 27 (1) (e) of the
act permits the deduction of business losses
which are incurred in the five taxation years
immediately preceding the taxation year and
the year immediately following the taxation
year.
Under section 12 of this bill, section 54 of
the act is amended by adding subsection 8.
What happened was this: a man would come
along and say "I am not going to pay you
any taxes this year because I expect I am going to have a loss next year". And when he did
not pay disputes would arise as to interest
charges on the instalments he should have
paid. This amendment is to clarify the situation, that while you are entitled to carry back
a loss, if the taxation year is a year of profit
you must pay your tax instalments in the
ordinary way, if you are in the class otherwise you may be subject to a penalty by way

of interest charges. You cannot anticipate your
position during the current taxation year.
It is only when the year has passed and it has
been determined that you have a loss that
an adjustment is made. In the meantime you
cannot withhold payment.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Do clauses 10 and 11 apply
to fishermen and lumbermen? Is there a wider
scope for them in regard to averaging?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes; and that principle
bas not been enlarged.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Do I understand the honourable senator to say that the quarterly
instalments have to be paid on the expected
profit even though the taxpayers ends the year
with a loss?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Then be is entitled to a
refund?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: He files his return and
shows his loss, and that be bas overpaid, and
when be is assessed he receives a refund.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Does be get any interest
on the money that he paid by instalments?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, that is a very unfair
feature in the Income Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know whether
"unfair" is the word to use.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Unjust.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The position taken by
the taxing authority is this, that if you have
an obligation to pay taxes and you are earning profits during the year, you should pay
your instalments of the tax. If you are not
making profits then you are not obliged to
pay a tax. But section 12, which I was
explaining, deals with the situation where
a man in a year in which he makes a profit
says "I anticipate a loss during the next
year and so I am not going to pay this year's
tax because I can carry back that loss". The
department's reply is, "Yes; under the law
you can carry it back, but we will deal with
that when we get to that point on the road. In
the meantime, you pay".
Sections 14 and 15, on page 10 of the bill,
will I think interest the house, as they have
to do with the taxing of, among other things,
mutual fire insurance companies. Section 14
implements Budget Resolution No. 7, and
section 15 implements Budget Resolution No.
6. By a decision within the last year on an
appeal by the Stanley Mutual Fire Insurance
Company from a ruling of the Income Tax
Appeal Board, the Supreme Court of Canada
decided that reserves accumulated out of
underwriting profits by a mutual company of
the type of the Stanley contained no element
of taxable income. It will be recalled that a
Royal Commission was appointed to inquire
into the activities of co-operatives and mutual
insurance companies, and as a result of the
report filed in 1946, legislation was brought
in, I think in 1947, under which underwriting profits of mutual companies were
made subject to income tax. The Stanley
case declared the law to be that they had no
taxable property.
These two sections do
several things; one is to re-establish the
right to tax mutual fire insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On their reserves or profits.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They are taxable on
their underwriting profits and reserves
accumulated from underwriting profits, and
they are taxable on their taxable income.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And on their premium
income.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Section 62 of the act,
exempts certain types of operations fron
income tax; and this amendment in section
14 of the bill, flowing out of the Stanley
decision, adds the provision that all mutual
companies are exempt from income tax

JUNE 10, 1954
where 50 per cent or more of their gross
premiums come from the insuring of farm
property or property used for fishing or residences of farmers or fishermen. So that the
mutual fire insurance companies have to
some extent been released from their tax
liability and are put into section 62, the
exempting section.
Then in section 15 we have the general
declaration of the law, that all insurance
companies other than life companies are taxable-I am proceeding with it in this fashion,
because this is the way the statute does itare taxable on their underwriting profit, and
investment income, and all rules applicable
for the determination of taxable income are
preserved and applied.
A rule established through the Superintendent of Insurance and the Department
of National Revenue in relation to foreign or
non-resident mutual insurance companies,
provides that if underwriting profits are
returned as taxable income, no return is
required of investment income, and the companies are not entitled to charge off any part
of head office expense. That arrangement
has been in effect since and including the
year 1947; so that for that period non-resident
mutual insurance companies, other than life
companies, have not included any item of
expense in the form of head office expense of
the parent company incurred outside of
Canada or any item in the form of investment income. I am told that a statement
provided recently to the Department of
Finance revealed that the head office expenses
and of the investment income attributable to
Canada in these operations would come fractionally close to balancing out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I point out to my
friend that circumstances have changed altogether. In the old days no record was made
of the interest on securities, because they
were held largely in England or in the United
States. The companies were not allowed to
deduct anything for head office expenses,
which at that time were very small, but I
am assured that this business has increased
so tremendously that the amount which may
not be taken off for head office expenses is
not nearly so great as the income that they
get from these receipts.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is my honourable
friend's statement, and I have made my statement, and given the source of my information.
If there is any question about it, when the
bill goes to committee he can ask a question.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Right.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: On page 11 will be found
a restatement of the law to the effect that
the underwriting profits of mutual insurance
companies other than life insurance companies, and the investment income of those
companies, are declared to be subject to tax.
In respect of resident corporations, that is
Canadian companies, that declaration in its
entirety is made applicable to the year 1954;
with respect to non-resident corporations it
is made applicable to the year 1953. To that
extent there is retroactivity, and a discrimination against non-resident and in favour of
resident corporations.
There is an additional provision that, in
respect of non-resident corporations, in the
computation of taxable income for the years
1947 to 1952, the yardstick shall be underwriting profit, investment income, and the
application of all the rules that have been
established for the determination of that
income; whereas for resident corporations it
is provided that, for the same period, in the
computation of their income, the only taxable
income is the investment income.
So much for the statement of the law
comprised in this section. Let us now see
how that works out. It means that so far
as resident insurance corporations other than
life are concerned the law now declares that
in the period 1947 to 1952 their taxable
income is their investment income only. If
any of the assessments are so recent that
companies can qualify under the provisions of
the Income Tax Act for a refund-which
means that application must be made within
a year after the notice of assessment or payment of tax-to the extent that they are
able to qualify for refund the resident companies would be able to apply and obtain
refund for any profits in respect of underwriting from 1947 to 1953, but in 1954 they
come under the general declaration of the
law.
Non-resident companies have no right of
refund at all, because any benefit which
might have accrued from the decision in the
Stanley case, in respect of years prior to 1953,
is removed by the general declaration of the
law that they are taxable on their underwriting profits and on their investment
income, and the computation of the tax from
1947 to 1952 is made upon that basis. This
declaration of the law applies to the year
1953, so there is no gap within which the
right to claim a refund might exist. Whether
that decision is good or bad, it is a matter
of policy determined by the government, and
the only comment on it that I have to make
at this time is simply that there is discrimination in that treatment of one class as against

SENATE
the other. I judge from the remarks of
the honourable member for Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) that his opinion is that the discrimination is in favour of the non-residents.
To me it appears to be a discrimination
against non-resident companies.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend what
is the reason for making any distinction
between the treatment of a resident company
and a foreign company? Why should not
both pay on their investment income? Then,
if they have a fair charge to make in respect
of head office expenses and that sort of thing,
they could deduct it. I suggest that that is
logical.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a matter of
policy. The rule, as a rule of practice, was
established by the department in 1946 or
1947, and has been followed since, and I am
not the person to take the position either that
the rule is good and should be adhered to,
or that it is bad and should be discontinued.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It was established about
thirty years ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Part of this section seems
to me to be retroactive by reason of the
Stanley case.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, in this sense.
Remember that these mutual companies were
made subject to our taxation law in 1946Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: -for
1947 on. They
have made their returns and paid their taxes
and for quite a number of these years, even
with the benefit of the retroactive feature in
the case of resident corporations, very little
can be recaptured. It depends upon how
long ago their returns have been assessed, or
how long ago they made their payments.
These changes do not override the refunding
provisions in the act, but there is a difference in the retroactive effect. The retroactive effect in relation to non-resident companies includes underwriting as well as
investment income. The retroactive effect
in respect to resident corporations is in relation only to the investment income.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Suppose a company paid
its 1947 tax in 1947, and applied early in
1948, it would not, under this legislation,
have any right to the refund of the money?
A year has gone by.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Because the overriding
provision of the refund section shuts them
out.
Section 16 deals with non-resident-owned
investment corporations. Whereas, under the
present law, a company could not qualify as

an "n.r.o." company if its principal business
was the making of loans, the clause is now
"spelled out" by stating that the principal
business is not "the making of loans, or
trading or dealing in mortgages", etc.
Section 17 deals with an employer's contribution to a trust. It has to do with what
are known as employees profit-sharing plans.
At present, under employees profit-sharing
plans, an emloyer who contributes money in
any year to the plan gets an exemption from
taxation in respect of the money he contributes, the trustee allocates the shares to
the employees concerned, and these employees pay the tax in the year in which
they get the benefit. But there was an odd
little kink in the wording of the section:
the payments had to be computed by reference to the profits. This caused a great deal
of trouble. Many of these agreements simply
provided that the company agreed to pay 2
per cent of its own profits to the fund.
According to one interpretation, that is not
an amount of money computed by reference
to profits. In order to avoid the distinctions
that have to be made in the interpretation
of plans, the expression "computed by reference to his profits from his business" have
been incorporated in the new subsection. This
new subsection authorizes an arrangement
whereby payments by an employer to a
trustee "out of profits" may be deemed to be
an employees profit sharing plan if the
employer so elects.
Section 18 of the bill amends section 81
of the act by adding a subsection (8). Section
81 of the act deals with undistributed income
on hand. When a company has a paid-up
capital and an undistributed income or
earned surplus, and it issues additional shares
or changes the par value of those shares
without increasing its own assets, then, under
those circumstances, it is provided that the
company is presumed to have capitalized its
undistributed income. To that extent, the
shareholders who received additional shares
would be taxable on a deemed-to-have-beenpaid dividend basis. In other words, if a
company increased its paid-up capital at a
time when it had undistributed income on
hand, and it did so other than by declaring
a stock dividend or by issuing shares and
receiving consideration for them, then it
would be deemed to have capitalized the
undistributed income.
Section 19 of the bill amends section 82
of the act, which also deals with undistributed income on hand. Subsections (1)
and (2) of section 19 merely involve technical
amendments that are required in order to
correct misprints made in last year's amending act.

JUNE ]
date of June 30, 1950. In effect, the amendment will permit companies transferring
dividends after the date of June 30, 1950, to
enjoy the benefit of subsection (12) of section
82 of the act.
Subsection (5) of section 19 of the bill,
which appears at the bottom of page 13 and
the top of page 14, simply provides that the
amendment as contained in subsection (4) of
section 19 of the bill covers the years 1950 to
1952 inclusive.
Subsection (6) of section 19 of the bill
amends section 82 of the act by introducing
new subsections to deal with control acquired
of inactive businesses. In the past some
people have gone out and acquired controlling
shares of an inoperative company whose
surplus account showed a deficit. Then they
would reactivate the company and be able
to take advantage of this deficit when the
company started earning taxable income.
At this point I want to state-and I think my
phraseology is well chosen-that hereafter
such a resurrection will be without reward.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the future when a
person acquires controlling interest in an
inactive company and then proceeds to reactivate it, for purposes of determining
undistributed income he must start from the
date on which he reactivated the company.
and he will not be able to take into accoun
the deficit the company had accumulated
prior to the time when it had become inactive.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: A person would be

The next amendment with which I wish
to deal is rather complicated, but I shall
endeavour to explain it as clearly as possible.
I refer to subsection (3) of section 19 of the
bill, which amends subsection (3) of section
82 of the act. This subsection in the act sets
out how a company computes undistributed
income, and the amendment specifically
applies to oil, gas and mining companies.
During the period from 1943 to 1947 exploration expenses were not allowable as
deductible items to these companies when
computing their income. However, depletion
allowances were calculated on gross income
and, by not deducting exploration expenses,
the companies had larger amounts on which to
calculate their depletion allowances. Instead
of being allowed to deduct exploration
expenses the companies were given a tax
credit equal to certain percentages of their
exploration expenses. But when you peruse
that section of the Income Tax Act which
provides for determining undistributed income
on hand at any time, you discover that a
company is entitled to take into its computation for income any expense or deduction not
otherwise allowable. Therefore, if a gas, oil
or mining company in determining its undistributed income on hand is going to accept
the depletion allowance benefit by reason of
the laws that existed between the years 1943
and 1947, it cannot also accept the benefit
that would result from deducting exploration
expenses for purposes of section 82. The
amendment under discussion makes it clear
that the company cannot enjoy a double
benefit in this regard. Honourable senators
will puzzle a long time over the formula
that is laid out here. I give no assurance
that it works or produces a fair result, but
the officials have claimed that it has been
tested, is workable and does produce a fair
result.
Subsection (4) of section 19 of the bill, on
page 13, introduces a new subsection (12) to
the act. It commences with these words:

SENATE

.ie had accumulated in the plan, he would
still be considered as entitled to the benefits
conferred upon him by the plan.
Section 22 (1) provides that special reserves may be set up in respect of advance
payments that have been received. This is
an extension of the privilege under section
85B of the act. The new subsection permits
reserves in respect of rents or similar payments for chattels other than a ship, if they
have been paid in advance for a period of
more than two years. For instance, some time
ago distributors of propane gas, who use
expensive equipment, were able to finance
their operations by getting prepayments from
customers, with whom they made contracts for
five years. This new subsection provides for the
setting up of special reserves in such cases.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would a sprinkler system
installed be included under the "chattels"
mentioned in the new subsection?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would have to be
decided first whether the installation was
part of the freehold of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would its cost be projected over a period of years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not in a position
to express an opinion on that at the moment.
Section 22 is not of sufficient importance
to require discussion, so I will pass on. Section
23 deals with an immigrant or a person who
resumes residence in Canada and has several
children who are eligible for family allowance payments. If the allowance is accepted
for, say, two months of the year the taxpayer
would get an exemption of only $150 per
child, instead of $400. The amendment gives
the taxpayer an option: he may elect to repay
the allowance received, and thus qualify for
the $400 exemption per child, or keep the
allowance and take an exemption of $150.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Will he be granted $400
exemption if he receives the family allowance
for only two months?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, yes-provided he
repays the amount of the allowances received.
Section 24 deals with the position of a
man who is selling out his business and may
have a reserve for accounts receivable. The
question to be resolved is how to allocate
the reserve. The new section deals with the
procedure to be followed as between the
vendor and the purchaser.
Section 25 would amend paragraph (i) of
section 105 (2). As honourable senators know,
under the present act a company can elect
to pay 15 per cent on that part of its surplus
accumulated after 1949 which is equal to
the aggregate of cash dividends declared. The

purpose of the amendment is to enlarge the
effect of section 105 so that taxable stock
dividends can be included in computing the
aggregate of dividends.
Section 26 amends section 105A (1) of the
present act, which deals with the redemption
of preferred shares at a premium. Heretofore,
the premium was taxable income but an
amendment made last year provided that if
a company redeemed shares at a premium, the
tax could be deducted from its undistributed
income on hand, or the company could pay
a tax of 20 per cent on the premium, and
then the shareholder received the premium
free of tax. Apparently, there must have been
a rash of these redemptions, and probably
some of the redemptions yielded substantial
premiums, perhaps as high as 20 per cent.
If so, that would be very profitable for someone who happened to be in a 70 per cent
tax bracket. The amendment provides that
if the premium on the redemption is more
than 10 per cent the company shall pay a tax
of 30 per cent instead of 20 per cent.
Section 27 is not too important, but I should
like to draw attention to subsection (2) which
provides that there must be a withholding of
tax in respect of rent paid to a non-resident
for television film that comes into Canada.
Heretofore the law has applied in the same
fashion to motion picture films.
I shall next direct your attention to section
28, which would amend section 108 of the
act, dealing with non-resident owned investment corporations, and the circumstances
under which the redemption or repayment of
debentures or bonds might be regarded as
a dividend payment. I think the section can
be understood from a reading of it.
Section 29 deals with loans to wholly-owned
subsidiaries and is quite easily understood.
However, I can summarize it briefly. A United
St ates parent company which has a subsidiary in Canada may borrow money and
lend it to the Canadian subsidiary. In those
circumstances if the original lender and the
parent company get together and agree
that the borrowing is for the Canadian subsidiary, the subsidiary does not have to withhold the tax.
I shall pass over the next few sections,
which are not of great importance, and come
to section 31, which has to do with the expression "arm's length". Time does not permit me
to make a full explanation of this section;
therefore, I suggest that honourable senators
read section 139 (5) of the Income Tax Act,
where it is stated in general terms what is
regarded to be dealing at arm's length. As
I say, it is a general statement of the law and
is open to very wide application. When you
read the amendments contained in section 31
of the bill, you will be inclined to say that

JUNE 10, 1954
they extend tremendously the law in relation
to arm's length. However, the main difference
is that whereas by section 139 (5) of the act
you have a general statement of the law, by
section 31 of the bill there is set out the particular application of "arm's length". I have
in my hand a sheet containing a list of cases
which could be applied to paragraphs (b) and
(c) of the new subsection (5a) of section

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading of Bill 469, an Act to authorize the provision of moneys to meet certain capital
expenditures of the Canadian National Railways System during the calendar year 1954,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her
Majesty of certain securities to be issued by
the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, it might be
useful if I made a few general observations
before ýcoming to the subject matter which
the bill covers.
The house will recall that two years ago
parliament passed the Canadian National
Railways Capital Revision Act, which was
a measure to revamp the capital structure of
the National Railways. Provision was made
at that time that any new capital expenditures the Canadian National management
thought necessary and advisable, would
require their bringing before parliament the
necessary legislation to secure the appropriations. Since that time we have had measures
providing for additional capital outlay by
the railway management.
I may say in passing-because in a sense
it is germane to what this bill proposesthat the Canadian National Railways' mileage
on what is called main line railways is 24,368
miles; in addition there are secondary lines,
concerning the character of which I am not

quite clear, also railway sidings, railway
yards and so forth, which bring the total
mileage in excess of 33,000 miles. Part of the
I shall now direct the attention of the house moneys asked for in this bill relate to that

with write-offs. In the case of exploration set out in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of

SENATE
it is generally known that both major railways in Canada are adopting operating practices used in the United States in the matter
of changing from steam locomotion to diesel
locomotion.
Diesel locomotives, so I am
advised, are more expensive than are steam
locomotives but their cost of operation is
cheaper and they have this additional advantage that their tractive power is substantially
greater than the tractive power of steam locomotives, and as a consequence, diesel power
can handle heavier and longer freight and
passenger trains. However, the handling of
longer trains necessitates changes in the layout of railway yards and in the length of
sidings. A substantial part of this proposed
expenditure for additions and betterments is
required for these purposes.
There is also an item in this bill which
may be the cause of some comment during
the discussion. It is an item of $5 million,
included in this amount, for a new Canadian
National Railways hotel in Montreal.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. I am not very familiar with giving these explanations, but I
think I can satisfy my honourable friend
because the information given to me is fairly
voluminous. But before I deal with that may
I give the house this information? This is a
comparison of the hotel accommodation in
various cities in Canada: Montreal has 308
rooms under the heading of first class hotel
accommodation per 100,000 population; on the
same base Toronto has 470 rooms, Winnipeg
660, and Vancouver 1,250. On that basis it
would seem that there would be quite a
reasonable prospect that a new hotel would
be profitable in Montreal.
Now I come to the question asked by the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner). I have a statement here which
shows the net profit of the Canadian National
Railways hotel system for each year as far
back as 1940. The profit for the year 1940,
after operating expenses and the payment of
taxes and insurance, amounted to $502,000.
It varies from year to year. In 1947, which is

is for new equipment; and here, you will
note they are asking $107,700,000 to pay for
obligations incurred prior to 1954 that become
due and payable in 1954. This equipment is
represented largely by new diesel locomotives.
In addition there are substantial numbers of
switching diesel locomotives, railway cars
of one kind and another, passenger cars,
sleeping cars, some dining cars and also
general equipment required by the railway.
Then, obligations incurred in 1954 which
become due and payable in 1954; that is,
in respect of orders which have been placed
say at the beginning of the year, and for
which payments have to be made before the
end of the year, amount to $39,000,000. That
makes a total under the new equipment item
of $147 million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The honourable senator
said he would speak about the diesel engines.
Where are they going to operate?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The purpose is that
ultimately diesel locomotives shall be operated over the whole system. I recall a high
official of the Canadian National Railways,
speaking before a committee about a year
ago, stated that it was not intended to build
any more steam locomotives, but they would
have to let the exising locomotive power run
out. This equipment is depreciated so much
a year, but when it is used up, according
to my information, only diesel locomotives
will be used.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My question is, where
they are going to use the new equipment,
particularly diesel engines?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They are using them all
over the system. If you were in Montreal
tonight you would see that diesels are being
used for switching purposes. They are used
for the sarne purpose in Winnipeg. Some
trains are being hauled by diesel locomotives.
Mr. Isnor: Where?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They are in operation
through the mountains, and I believe all
equipment in Newfoundland is now dieselpowered. I have not the slightest doubt that
it will not be many years before diesels are
down in my honourable friend's bailiwick.
I come now to the questions of the
acquisition of securities. There are certain
joint ventures of the Canadian Pacific and
the Canadian National Railways. For instance, the Toronto Terminals Company is
jointly owned; and the Alberta Northern
Railways are jointly operated. When such
enterprises require additional capital they
make their requests to the Canadian National
Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway,

issue their securities, and these securities are
taken up by the two railroads. The amount
of $11,236,000 in the bill is the sum which
the Canadian National Railways will need
for this purpose. I might add one further
explanation. All the stock of Trans-Canada
Air Lines is held by the Canadian National
Railways System. In the amount shown here,
details of which will be given in full when
the company's officers come before the committee-presumably this bill will be sent to
committee-is an item of $10 million which
is required for Trans-Canada Air Lines.
Since that corporation is wholly owned by
Canadian National Railways, the capital
expenditure it requires has to be submitted
to parliament through the Canadian National
Railways.
One other item to which I will briefly
refer is that of capital expenditures, amounting to $45 million, which sum is required to
make payments not exceeding that amount
for the year 1955, prior to July lst of that
year, in discharge of obligations incurred
for new equipment and betterments which
became due and payable before that date.
This covers the main purposes of the
bill. It is a type of legislation which comes
before parliament annually and will continue
to do so, because of the fact that the
Canadian National Railways, by what I
regard as a wise provision, are unable to
make one dollar of capital expenditure, for
which they must get funds from parliament,
until the details of that expenditure are
placed before parliament. It will be recalled
that under the Canadian National Railways
Capital Revision Act the government, in the
revamping of the capital structure of the
railways, took a large blockHon. Mr. Haig: Over a billion dollars.
Hon. Mr. Crerar:-of 4 per cent preference stock, upon which interest was to be
paid only if the railway earned it in the
current year: the liability was not, as it had
been before, cumulative. Whatever profits the
Canadian National Railways made last year
-I think they were low, amounting to about
a quarter of a million dollars-are applied
by way of interest on this 4 per cent
preference stock. One consequence is that
each year they must come back to parliament to obtain the capital required for
expansion for the purpose which in a general
way, I have indicated to the house as being
required this year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is there in this bill any
provision to take care of a possible deficit
on the operations of the railway this year?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: That would be taken care
of next year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no. It must be provided
this year.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Whether or not there will
be a deficit this year is "in the lap of the
gods". Should there be a deficit, the Canadian National Railways, through the government, must come to parliament to find some
way of meeting it. I presume there are
several ways they could deal with it, but I
am not going to anticipate what method they
might adopt. However, until the deficit arises they will not bring forward their proposals
for dealing with it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The honourable gentleman referred to a dieselization program. Will
such a program effect any saving in the
matter of crews? I am thinking of firemen,
for instance. Will firemen still have to be
carried on the locomotives?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I cannot say as to that.
I understand that the railways expect to
effect considerable economies. First of all,
they will haul longer trains with the same
manpower. The struggle of the railways has
gone on continuously for years against mounting costs. They have had to meet rising
costs in the matter of wage increases and increases in the cost of materials. In order to
try and meet these costs they have increased
the weight and length of their trains. Diesel
locomotives will enable the railroads to operate even larger trains with the same crews.
To take advantage of that they must readjust
all their facilities. I would not attempt for
a moment to give any estimate of what the
economy might be in that respect, but I am
quite certain that if my honourable friend is
in committee on Tuesday next, when I understand this bill is to be dealt with, the railway
officials can give him the answer.

The Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill
(7 from the House of Commons) intituled: "An
Act respecting the Criminal Law", have in
obedience to the order of reference of 11th
May, 1954, examined the said bill and now
beg leave to report the English version of the
bill with the following amendments:
1. Page 10, lines 1 to 9: strike out clause
9 and substitute therefor the following:
"9. (1) Where a court, judge, justice, or
magistrate summarily convicts a person for
a contempt of court committed in the face of
the court and imposes punishment in respect
thereof, that person may appeal against the
punishment imposed.
(2) Where a court or judge summarily convicts a person for a contempt of court not
committed in the face of the court and punishment is imposed in respect thereof, that
person may appeal
(a) from the conviction, or
(b) against the punishment imposed.
(3) An appeal under this section lies to
the court of appeal of the province in which
the proceedings take place, and, for the purposes of this section, the provisions of Part
XVIII apply, mutatis mutandis."
2. Page 13, lines 8 to 14: strike out subclause (3) of clause 25 and substitute therefor
the following:

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is moved by the honourable Senator
Gouin, seconded by the honourable Senator
Macdonald, that this bill be now read a third
time. Is it your pleasure to concur in the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. I said "Next sitting"
a moment or two ago, but I do not suppose
that I was heard. This bill should be stood
over, because I want to have a word or two
to say on it. Of course, if you want to shove
everything throughHon. Mr. Macdonald: I understood the
honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to say "Next sitting", but there was before the house a
motion by the honourable senator from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) for third reading. As far as I am concerned, it is immaterial whether the bill is given the third
reading at the next sitting or now. Would
it be convenient to the honourable gentleman to make his speech on the third reading
now?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will say the few words
I have to say now, but I do not see what the
rush is all about. I do not see why I should
be looked at askance because I said "Next
sitting". We are not going to quit here till
the next couple of weeks, and there is no
life-and-death urgency about this matter
at all.
The Hon. the Speaker: After I put the
motion for third reading I paused and did
not hear anyone object.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; the honourable senator
from New Westminster has already done so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I make a comment? As I understand what happened, His
Honour the Speaker asked when the bill
should be read the third time. The honourable senator from New Westminster said
"Next sitting", but there was quite a lot of
noise in the chamber at the time and evidently His Honour could not hear the remark.
The honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) moved that the bill be read
the third time now. Therefore, the motion
before the house at the present time is
on the third reading of the bill, and it can
be debated. The honourable gentleman from
New Westminster has, in fact, spoken on that
motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did the honourable senator
from New Westminster speak on the motion
for third reading?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not understand that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable sena-

tor from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has
spoken on the same motion, and the honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Vien) was doing so also.
Hon. Mr. Vien:

Furthermore, under the

Senate Rules, a motion to pass a bill is
debatable, let alone a motion for third
reading.
As the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) stated on his point of order, the honourable member from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) did object to the third reading of the bill today. However, afterwards
he said what he had to say, and no longer
objected to passage of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not understand that.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I think I have made my
own point clear. The question before us is
not the one which the honourable senator
from New Westminster debated, but whether
we should extend diplomatic immunities and
privileges to commonwealth representatives
in Canada. The question whether, generally,
diplomatic immunities and privileges should
be abolished, is not under consideration at
this time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
must say that I differ from my honourable
friend. This bill does raise the question of
diplomatic immunities and privileges. The
purpose of the bill is to extend to the High
Commissioners from commonwealth countries all the privileges that foreign diplomats
have. Therefore, the matter of diplomatic

immunities is debatable. That is the very
problem that is raised. We had it under
discussion in committee this morning.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, but the question of
the existence of these immunities and
privileges does not arise.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it does. The bill provides for extension of diplomatic privileges
to commonwealth representatives here. Further, it gives the governor in council power
to take these privileges away if it bo deemed
advisable.
There is one world power which uses its
diplomatic services for the purpose of spreading propaganda and engaging in espionage.
A recent case in Australia showed that there
were five or six times as many people
employed by the Russians in their embassy
at Canberra as by the Australians at Moscow.
There was a similar situation with respect
to Canada in 1946, when we had the espionage trouble. That kind of thing does not do
the world any good at all. If diplomatic
privileges and immunities were not granted
to members of the Russian embassy bore they
could not use them for espionage purposes.
They did use them to hurt Canada rather
than to help her, thereby injuring relations
between this country and Russia, and the
effect will be felt for many years, because
Russia does not forget or forgive.
I should like to know what benefit Canada
derives by granting these immunities, and
why a diplomat needs them. I suppose the
High Commissioner for the United Kingdom
is the most notable diplomat here, and I
should like to know what he and his staff do
in Canada. I suppose they make representations to and have communication with the
government of Great Britain, but actually
our principal dealings with Great Britain are
done by cabinet ministers of the two countries in conferences at London and Ottawa.
Privileges extended to diplomats enable
them to put on parties and serve high-class
wines at about one quarter what it would
cost a Canadian citizen to do so. I ask: why
do we extend such privileges, and what do
we gain thereby? For the past ten or fifteen
years I have been puzzled as to why we subscribe to such a practice. I quite agree that a
representative of a foreign country who is trying to build up trade should be given certain
privileges and immunities, but why should we
go to the point of allowing diplomats to
escape taxation on the goods they buy here?
Some claim that right is extended to them
under the common law.
I have always felt that people of a democratic country such as ours are not much
given to negotiating through diplomats. We

JUNE 15, 1954
prefer to carry on business through our ministers, who represent the government. In that
respect, I will say without fear of contradiction
that on his recent trip to the Far East our
Prime Minister did more for Canada than
all the diplomats we have had in the past
ten years or will have in the next ten years.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When the President of the
United States visits Canada he comes not as
a diplomat, but he spreads more diplomacy
and is a better ambassador for his country
than any of his diplomats; yet no particular
immunities are extended to him.
If we are going to give diplomatic immunities and privileges, I would of course sooner
see thern go to the representatives of commonwealth countries than to anybody else.
But if we do this for the commonwealth
countries, we shall have to do it for Russia.
The problem is that a country like Canada,
with only 15 million people, should look to
where its dollars are being spent, for it may
not be as easy to get a dollar in the next ten
years as it has been in the past. When we
are spending perhaps millions on diplomatic
services, let us not forget the unemployment
that exists in Canada today. As a businessman, I cannot see any benefit coming from
our expenditures on diplomatic services.
I am surprised that we are putting such
emphasis on the granting of diplomatic immunities, for diplomats have nothing to do with
the actual business between our countries.
If Australia, for instance, wanted to negotiate
some very important transaction with Canada, do you think she would do it through
her diplomats? No; if the affair was of a
major nature she would send one of her
ministers here to meet with a minister of our
government. For example, our Minister of
Public Works is now carrying on negotiations
with Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: But the work is
done by our diplomatic officials in the foreign
countries before the minister arrives there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe so; I hope you are
right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: He knows.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would remind the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) that the government now has a man
in Great Britain trying to sell our wheat.
How is he getting along?
Hon. Mr. King: How would you expect
him to get along?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to know what the
diplomats are doing. We in western Canada
are facing a most difficult situation: none of
our 1953 wheat crop has been sold, and not
83280-39

all of our 1952 crop; the people who should
buy from us, and who have an agreement to
do so, are not buying. What are our ambassadors doing about that situation?
Hon. Senators: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Mr. Speaker, while I hesitate
to interrupt the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I feel I must rise
on a point of order. Although the rules of
this house are much more flexible than those
of the House of Commons, we cannot allow
the reasoning of the honourable gentleman to
go unchallenged. The subject-matter he is
now discussing is far removed from the question before the house. He is talking about
wheat and the expediency of maintaining or
restricting our existing diplomatic representation abroad. The bill before us is limited
to the question of whether or not we should
extend diplomatic privileges and immunities
to the representatives of other dominions in
Canada. I respectfully submit that the honourable leader's remarks exceed the scope of
the debate on this bill and are therefore
out of order.

Hon. Senators:. Question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am discussing the matter
of diplomatic services.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Mr. Speaker, the bill does
not deal with the expediency of maintaining
diplomatic services.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It does.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The bill proposes to extend
diplomatic immunities to the representatives
of commonwealth countries in Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
while the honourable gentleman from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) may be technically
correct on the point of order that he has
raised, in this house there is usually a lack
of opportunity to discuss bills in committee of
the whole and so the practice has been to
allow a greater latitude in debate on bills
of this kind than perhaps would be permitted
in the House of Commons. As the present
occasion may be the only one on which the
honourable Leader of the Opposition may
have an opportunity to make his remarks, I
would rule that he may proceed.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But Mr. Speaker, may he
continue to discuss the sale of wheat?
The Hon. the Speaker: I am sure the
honourable the leader will not intentionally
violate the rules of the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, if I have overstepped my rights, I assure you it was not
intentional.

SENATE

I shall conclude by saying that as this bill
would extend certain immunities and privileges to the High Commissioner for Great
Britain, I feel that what I have said was
proper to say.
Hon. Mr. King: The same privileges will
be extended to the representatives of Australia, South Africa and the other dominions.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
COST OF PROPOSED HOTEL AT MONTREAL

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
may I claim the attention of the house for a
moment before the Orders of the Day are
called? At the sitting last Thursday, while
I was discussing the Canadian National
Railways Financing and Guarantee Bill, the
honourable senator from New Westminister
(Hon. Mr. Reid) interjected a question which
I overlooked replying to, and I would like to
do so now before the debate is resumed. The
honourable member's question had to do with
the proposed hotel in Montreal to be constructed by the Canadian National Railways.
I had explained to the house that in the bill
there was an item of $5 million for this hotel
and my honourable friend interjected this
question:
Are you sure it is going to cost only $5 million?
It is going to be more like $20 million, in my
opinion.

I apologize to him for omitting to deal with
that question. Of course, the hotel will cost
much more than $5 million. I believe the
estimate is something like $20 million, but
$5 million is being voted in the current year;
and if this amount is not spent, the vote for
the unspent portion will lapse and there will
have to be a vote for that portion next year.
HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS

739TH ANNIVERSARY OF SIGNING OF
MAGNA CARTA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I have the privilege of calling the
attention of the house to the fact that this
day, the 15th of June, is the 739th anniversary
of the signing of Magna Carta by King John
at Runnymede. King John had no intention
of carrying out his promises, but that document signed 739 years ago today has formed
the basis of British constitutional liberty
through all the centuries since then. And
apropos of that, may I also 'call attention to

the fact that in 1950 this house adopted a
report on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms expressing a principle very much
akin to that of Magna Carta. In that report
there was this paragraph which I would like
to read now:
Such a declaration of human rights adopted by
the Canadian parliament would solemnly affirm
the faith of all Canadians in the basic principles
of freedom, and it would evidence a national concern for human rights and security. Judges would
recognize the principles of such a declaration as
part of Canada's public policy and subsequent parliaments would hesitate to enact legislation violatTo adults it would

Honourable senators, I think it is well now
and again to remind ourselves of these historie
landmarks of freedom.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
PROROGATION
INQUIRY

Hon.

Mr.

Reid:

Honourable

senators,

I

would like to ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) whether he bas
any information to give the house regarding
further legislation to be brought down, and
if there is anything to the report that a
tentative agreement has been arrived at this
morning as to the closing of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information

other than the information that appears on
the Order paper of the House of Commons.
With respect to that part of the question
regarding a tentative agreement, I might say
that I have no authority to enter into an
agreement and, in fact, I am not a party to
any agreement and I know nothing of such an
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Reid: For the purpose of the
record, honourable senators, I did not mean
to say that the honourable Leader of the
Government entered into any agreement on
behalf of the Senate, but I understood that
an agreement was entered into between the
opposition parties and the government in the
other house as to a tentative date for the
closing of parliament.
The opposition
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
parties in the other house have agreed as
to when the other bouse will close, is that
what I am to understand?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I can assure the
honourable senator that if I am given any
information I will pass it along. They may
have advised the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).

Bouffard) introduced the bill. Mr. Fairweather was very careful to show why the
short line in Ontario was required, and I
think we were all satisfied with his explanation.
Aiso we were satisfied that the line should
be extended from Beattyville to Chibougamau. We were told that this line would
tap the centre of a big mineral area, that
the mineral concentrates could be taken from
there to Noranda, and that contracts had
already been made with certain timber and
pulpwood interests which would be sufficient
to provide the company with quite a large
annual revenue; also that a railway is very
much needed to open up that great territory.
However, I did take some exception to
granting the company a charter to build a
line from St. Felicien to Chibougamau,
because, as Mr. Fairweather clearly stated,
there is no traffic at present for such a line,
there may never be any traffic for it, and
the line may not be built at all. The cost would
be $17 million. We are asked to give the
company a charter now to build a line which
may never be constructed. It is true that,
before the line could be built, the company's
representatives would have to come to parliament for the necessary funds, but why
should not the charter be delayed until that
time? Why grant the charter five, six, eight
or ten years before it will be needed?
I thought I should bring to the attention
of the bouse the facts with regard to this
projected line between St. Felicien and Chibougamau and register my protest in this
connection.

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved the third
reading of Bill 442, an Act respecting the
construction of lines of railway by Canadian
National Railways Company from St. Felicien
to Chibougamau and from Chibougamau to
Beattyville, all in the province of Quebec,
and from Hillsport on the main line of the
Canadian National Railways to Manitouwadge
Lake, both in the Province of Ontario.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,

SENATE
In connection with this particular project
we hope to extend railway development to
the height of land, the dividing line, in a
part of the country which was also part of
the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company.
It is what used to be known as Rupert's
Land, and once upon a time, when the
Honourable Sir Lomer Gouin was premier
of Quebec, that part of our northern territory was transferred to Quebec, as also the
northern part of Ontario was transferred to
our sister province.
What harm can be done by granting the
power to build the line? As the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
admitted a few minutes ago, it will be necessary to come before parliament to ask for
the funds required to construct it.
If the Senate refuses my good friends of
the Lake St. John district the opportunity
to eventually build this line, they will be
terribly disappointed and will feel that they
have not been treated fairly. Even now it
is their hope that the company will be able
to proceed at the sane time with the part
of the line which will run from Beattyville
to Chibougamau, and the extension from
Chibougamau in a southeasterly direction to
St. Felicien.
I hope that this house will share my views
and give us what may be called a conditional
green light. Let us at least retain our hope,
if we cannot get more than that at the
plesent time.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
I wish to add a word or so on this bill.
When Mr. Fairweather came before the committee he was insistent that a charter should
be granted because he wanted to be in a
position to recommend to the governor in
council the construction of the line as soon
as the development seemed to be needed.
He said that at any time representations
might be expected from lumber companies
or persons interested in the construction of a
smelter at Chicoutimi, and he wanted to be
in a position to say to the lumber company,
"As soon as you are ready to ship your
lumber", and to those interested in the
smelter, "As soon as you are ready to construct it", the Canadian National would construct the line. That is the purpose of granting a charter to the Canadian National Railways now.
No risk is involved in giving this permission: it does not assure the Canadian National
Railway Company of any money, but it will
enable the minister concerned and the board
of the Canadian National Railways, when
the conditions warrant such action, to decide
without delay whether the line should be
built at once.

I am astonished at the stand taken at this
time by the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). The only objection raised during the debates in the other
house was to this effect: "Why do you not
build the line right away?"
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: And that was the attitude of the opposition. In committee the
spokesman
National Railways
Canadian
stated, in effect, "We are not ready; at the
moment we have not enough assurances to
warrant the commitment." But to my mind
it is strange that, on this matter, the opposition in this house does not agree with the
opposition in the other place. Instead of
saying "You should build a line right away",
they oppose giving the railway the right to
build the line.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There are no politics
here.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Well, maybe, but that
is a very surprising statement. I think there
are two parties in the Senate, and I am glad
of that fact. In any event, I cannot foresee
any trouble in granting the C.N.R. this charter, for they will not proceed with any of the
work until they deem it advisable. When
responsible people decide to build up the
Saguenay region they will merely have to
consult with the minister and the board of
directors of the C.N.R., and upon finding that
the latter are ready to make certain commitments they will be in a position to make
some themselves.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If the charter is granted
will it not be possible for the railway to
complete the road without coming to parliament?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The bill specifically
provides that no construction can be commenced without authority from the governor
in council.
Hon. Mr. Horner: From the governor in
council, but not from parliament?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The governor in council cannot give the Canadian National Railways any money without authorization from
the House of Commons and the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
10, the adjourned debate on the motion of

JUNE 15, 1954
Hon. Mr. Hayden for the second reading of
Bill 467, an Act to amend the Income Tax
Act.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to delay the house, for I feel
that our esteemed colleague from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) thoroughly explained this
bill on second reading last Thursday.
This legislation, which affects the control of revenues in various sections of the
Income Tax Act is very involved. The
amendments cover many points and indicate
the complicated nature of the income tax law.
Before dealing with the amendments themselves I should like to congratulate the government upon having such an able income tax
inspector in the province of Manitoba. This
official has been rendering fine service, and
while I do not have any dealing with him
myself, I have heard nothing but praise for the
fair way in which he deals with the public. I
have not heard one single complaint about
the office there in the last two or three years.
I think that is a high compliment, for considering that the income tax law is so complicated and affects so many people, it is indeed
a wonder that there has not been a deluge of
complaints. Income tax law is so complex
that one can readily see why alert accountants
and able lawyers can find ways to escape its
provisions. I do not suggest that they are
dishonest; it is just that parts of the act may
be interpreted in different ways. I should
really like to make a much longer speech at
this time, but I observe that a certain honourable senator is not present in the chamber.
I imagine he has gone home for the week-end.
An Hon. Senator: That is not nice.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I refer to the honourable
gentleman who challenged my statement the
other day.
I do not know what the Senate can hope
to achieve if it is not given greater liberty
to deal with financial questions. One of our
difficulties is that the estimates do not come
to us before the final days of the session.
This year they will probably not be placed
before the Senate until twenty-four hours
before parliament prorogues. It is my hope
that next session the Senate will amend its
rules or that the House of Commons will see
fit to send certain legislation to us at a much
earlier date in the session. The Senate
should be entitled to hold its own budget
debate and not have to wait until the tail
end of the session to get information.
Honourable senators, I object to section 15
of the bill because it is retroactive in its
application, and I do not think any legislation should be retroactive. I do not think that

in 1954 we should amend our statutes by
saying that what we intended to do in 1946
was so and so. The laws we enact now
should apply only from this date forward.
By enacting this legislation, which is to be
retroactive to cover the last five or six
years, we are saying in effect that certain
things have been done illegally under the
present law. I am not too sure, of course,
that the amendments contained in section 15
will be as effective as the government
wishes. That is another matter.
Manitoba has the two largest mutual life
insurance companies in the dominion of
Canada. Now, the original statement made
by the Minister of Finance, when dealing
with this problem, included reference to a
great many mutual life insurance companies
in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, but
they do not come under this legislation,
whereas two large companies in Manitoba do.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What are the names of
those companies?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Wawanesa Mutual
Insurance Company and the Portage la
Prairie Mutual Insurance Company.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like to point out
that the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) referred, I am sure in error, to
mutual life insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I meant to say mutual fire
insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is why I asked
for the names of the companies in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thank the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for
his correction. I should like to give the
house an illustration. Let us suppose that
an agent from the Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company comes to my farm and inquires whether I have any insurance on my
farm house, barn or machine shed, and I
advise him that I have not. I agree with him
that I should have insurance, and he says,
"I am an experienced valuator, and I am
selling insurance all the time. You should
have $7,000 insurance on that house." Then
he looks over the other property and says
I should have $4,000 on the barn, $2,000 on
the machine shed. That is a total of $13,000.
"Now", he says, "We will insure those buildings for that amount, with the loss payable
to you or, if you have a mortgage on the
place, with the loss payable first to the mortgage company, and the balance if any to
you." The premium for the year 1954 is $100,
but he says: "You don't need to pay us cash.
Give us a note for $100, and when we know
the cost rate for the year 1954 we will write
and tell you." At the end of 1954 the

SENATE
Wawanesa Mutual finds that the cost rate
of insurance for $13,000 was $50, not $100,
and their representative says, "Send in $60
instead of $50, for we have to set up a
reserve of $10 from your $60, because if we
had a bad risk during the year, like a prairie
fire, or one like Winnipeg had the other day,
with a wind at 70 miles an hour, the loss
would probably be $300 instead of $100; we
cannot charge you $300, but every year we
will put about $10 of your money into a
reserve to pay for loss." As I understood it,
the $10 that goes into reserve earns interest,
and the income tax department charges tax
on whatever the revenue is per year from
interest on the reserve account. That is what
I understood at first, but now I believe there
is some question about that. It has been
intimated to me that not only the income
from that reserve may be taxed, but also
any money put into the reserve fund, as if
it were income. I say that is not right. That
is what the legislation of 1946 tried to do,
but on the appeal in the case of the Stanley
Mutual Company of New Brunswick the
Supreme Court of Canada held that the
legislation did not do that. Now an attempt
is being made to make the present legislation retroactive.
I object to the putting of a tax on the
reserve taken out of premiums paid by the
farmer to protect the liability on policies
held by him. I do not object to the tax on
the income of that reserve at all; indeed, I
think a tax should be payable on it. Forty
years ago I took out a life insurance policy,
and at the end of twenty years the policy
was paid up. I did not cash it and, thank
goodness, I did not die, so the policy is still
in force. Every year some insurance company sends me a notice concerning my
policies to announce an increase in its reserve
and to tell me that my dividends have increased. I do not pay any income tax on
that at all, although I did for seven or eight
years. Then I found that I was not as
bright a lawyer as I had thought, for I had
believed that to be income. One day while
a chartered accountant was in my office
examining my books I received one of these
dividend notices, and he said, "Well, you do
not have to pay any income tax on that at
ail." I looked it up and found he was right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It was regarded as a
return of capital was it not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Exactly. That is what I
say, this $10 is return of capital. Nobody
uses that money.
Honourable senators, I have stated my first
objection.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why do they leave out
Ontario mutual companies and put in the
Manitoba mutual companies?
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are asking me a
political question, and I do not think I should
answer it, because I have been told that I
have been raising political questions before
today. I am not suggesting that the reason
they kept Manitoba mutual companies in
and did not include Ontario and Quebec
companies is that there are more votes in
Quebec and Ontario supporting the government than in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That condition will
probably continue after this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My second objection is to
putting in an amendment in 1954 to
say what the law was intended to be in
1946.
The retroactive feature is wrong,
although I admit it is open to argument both
ways. Are we as a house prepared to pass
a retroactive law in 1954 applying to legislation which was passed in 1946? I object
very seriously to that. I hope there will be
enough members in this house to support the
stand that we, at least, as one part of the
parliament of Canada do not believe in
retroactive legislation. It is a wrong principle.
You cannot conduct business on that basis
at all. I remember only one or two occasions
in my experience when this house dealt with
retroactive legislation, and we objected,
although there was far more justification than
now for passing it. Honourable senators, I
object to the inclusion of this provision in the
bill.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
first, I wish to compliment the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) upon his very
exhaustive and clear explanation of the bill,
which is a very difficult one for laymen,
and perhaps even for some lawyers, to
understand-as my friend the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has indicated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The record of my friend
the senator from Toronto has been of that
high character all along the line, and he
has been of great assistance to this house.
I listened with interest to the remarks
of the Leader of the Opposition about retroactive legislation. On general principles, I
feel about the same as he does-I do not like
retroactive legislation. Although he is a
lawyer and I am not, I feel he may not be
quite correct in assuming that this particular
legislation will be retroactive.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be.

JUNE 15, 1954
Hon. Mr. Euler: I had a discussion this
morning with Mr. Gavsie, Deputy Minister of
the Department of National Revenue, the
head of the Income Tax Branch, and I
gathered from what he said-perhaps when
my friend from Toronto concludes the debate,
he will clear the matter up-that the legislation need not be retroactive to the extent
that the Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Comnpany cannot stili obtain the refund, provided
the minister permits a reassessrnent.

and I arn not yet quite convinced that the
explanation he gave is the correct one. As I
have said, legisiation was passed in 1947 that
placed a tax on income from investments of
an insurance company and on its underwriting profits. While that law may bave been
quite sound in principle, there was a defect
in it, in that there was an error in draftsmansbip, as bas been admitted by officiais
of the department.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Burchill: As distinguished from
the first item.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The income received from
investments is an amount that is easily
ascertainable. If the premiums received, after
paying enough to reserve, are not enough to
pay the losses plus expenses, then there will
be a loss, but if they are more than the losses
a profit will be made-an underwriting
profit on which they have to pay income tax.
Is that clear?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The income tax that was
paid by the Wawanesa company amounted to
$931,000 over a four-year period.
The British company, in their Canadian
operations, had premiums not quite so large,
something over $22 million. Their underwriting profit was a little over $1 million, and
their investment income was $892,000, a total
profit of about $1,903,000.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Is that for a year, or
is it over the same four-year period you
mentioned?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Over the four-year period.
And this company paid no tax at all.
The American company received premiums

amounted to $427,000, and their investment
income was $881,000, a total of about
$1,308,324, on which they paid no tax
whatsoever.
Now, that amazed me and I immediately
assumed that not only was the government
being deprived of revenue that it should
have received but that there was unfair discrimination against the Canadian companies,
very unfair discrimination. It also occurred to
me that perhaps that was one of the reasons
why Canadian fire insurance companies are
now writing less than 17 per cent of the fire
insurance business in Canada, the rest of it
being written by foreign and British companies. There are, of course, other reasons.
The figures I have given are taken from
the government blue book on insurance
matters, and they are correct.
I have brought this matter to the attention of Mr. Gavsie, and he told me that our
government did not collect any tax from
them, that these British and foreign companies did not pay any tax. They took the
same position as did the Stanley Mutual Fire
Insurance Company and if that decision
stood, these companies would pay no tax

from investments. My friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), I think, explained this
matter the other day. I understand that, in
the early days, when Mr. Breadner was
Deputy Minister of Customs and Excise, there
was no separate income tax branch, and he
looked after the administration of the comparatively small income tax at that time. The
rates were low, the business was small and
it was rather difficult to ascertain the true
amount of income from investments by
foreign companies, because their deposits
were made first with some agent of the Canadian government, say in London, and coupons
were clipped outside the country.
In those circumstances, it was most difficult
to ascertain their true income from investments, so an arrangement was made whereby
foreign companies should not be taxed on
investment income. But to offset that privilege
they were not permitted to deduct from profits
for income tax purposes any amount of head
office expense. Whether the two items
equalize matters, I do not know, but it seemed
to me a wrong way to do it. It would have
been preferable, I think, to treat all companies
alike: if some companies are to be taxed on
their profits from investments-as Canadian
companies are-then I think all companies,
including foreign companies, should be so
taxed. At the same time, they should be
allowed to charge a fair amount against head
office expense. To make that plan applicable
to all companies, both Canadian and foreign,
would put the thing on an equitable, fair and
even basis.
The British and foreign companies were
supposed, however, to pay taxes on their
underwriting profits, but to my amazement
I found, on discussing this matter with the
manager of a certain company, that these
companies had not paid taxes, not only on
income from investments but on their underwriting profits as well.
I have before me a statement giving some
pertinent figures in connection with this. The
first company I will consider is a Canadian
company, the Wawanesa, the second a British
company-I could give the name-and then
a United States company. Here are some
amazing facts, covering a four year period
from 1948 to 1951.
The premiums written by the Wawanesa
company were, in round figures, $26 million.
Their underwriting profit was $1,800,000 and
their investment income was $1,126,000, or
a total of about $2,938,000-nearly $3 million.

JUNE 15, 1954
made in the iaw a year ago, with the resuit
that these companies are now paying a tax on
the difference between the income on their
assets and their liabilities. But so far as
this particular angle that I arn discussing is
concernied, they have flot paid any tax on
those items. Now, with this amendment to the
law, resulting as it does from. the Stanley
Mutuai judgment, in future these British and
foreign companies will be obliged to pay tax
on their underwriting profits.
I hope it works out this way. Certainiy
if it does flot and if these companies shouid
in any way escape through a fauity drafting
of the law, it would be flot only unfair to
the government, inasmuch as revenue would
be lost, but certainly it would be unfair to
Canadian companies which have to compete
with these British and foreign companies.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Are these foreign companies incorporated in Canada under Canadian laws?
Han. Mr. Euler: I think some of them are
subsidiary companies, yes. That reminds me
of something else. Years ago it might have
been a littie difficuit to tax them, because
of exchange considerations and because it was
difficuit; to check on the amount of the revenue from investment, but I think that is not;
the case now. I think that nearly ail these
companies, and especially the British companies, are pretty well self-contained in
Canada, and it wouid flot be at ail difficuit
to find out what their investment income is.
If that is flot the case I stili say it would be
better and more consistent with logic and
fairness if ail insurance companies were put
on the same basis. If Canadian companies
have to pay on investment income and underwriting profits, then the British and foreign
companies should pay the samne, and so I say
put them ail on the samne basis.

and in addition, I arn assured by the Superintendent of Insurance and by Mr. Gavsie,
these companies will flot be permnitted to
deduct from taxable income any of their head
office expense. He says that they are watching that very closeiy on behaif of the Canadian insurance companies, for which I am
very glad indeed. I think that ail companies
in Canada, in business to make a profit, ought
to be taxed on their profits. Non-resident
companies ought to be on the saine basis as
our Canadian companies: certainiy conditions shouid flot be made prejudicial to the
prosperity of the Canadian insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: I would just like to ask
the honourabie senator to clear Up a point
for me. Do I understand that these British

the English language, and consequently the
circumstances connected with the collection
of this tax are very much resented by a
great many people. One trouble arises from
the slowness with which returns are handled.
A short time ago the department was four
years behind with its reassessments. At the
present time they are more nearly abreast
of things; yet a long period still elapses
between the time when the report is assessed
in the first place and the time when the
reassessment is made. Where a mistake has
been made-for instance, if some item of
income has been overlooked-interest is
attached to the sum so deficient. It is these
penalties to which the average person
objects, because they have been incurred
without any intention on his part to violate
the law but are the result of an oversight or
some unavoidable circumstance. I recall the
case of a farmer who every year since 1942
had paid income taxes varying from twelve
to fifteen hundred dollars, but, because of
various complications, did not during that
period get a reassessment. In the meantime,
to build a big elevator for the storage of his
grain, he spent practically all his available
funds, and he is now faced with ruin because
of the accumulation of reassessment charges.
There is a real problem. especially among
the farming community, in this connection.
By contrast, consider the position of railway employees, who work on a regular
salary. Each month the company deducts
from their pay cheques an amount for income
tax, and while this makes a bad hole in their
take-home pay it keeps them up-to-date on
their income tax liabilities, and adjustments,
if necessary, can ba made at the end of the
year.
My suggestion is that the department
should consider a production tax. I realize
there would be difficulties in this connection.
On the sale of a thousand bushels of wheat
the rich man would have to pay a larger sum
by way of tax than the poor man, because of
the different income brackets. But this plan
would have one great advantage. The department has a record of sales of wheat to the
Wheat Board and of the cattle sold to the
various dealers; and if the tax were deducted
at the time of sale the farmer's attention
would be drawn to the fact that the tax was
due, and he would avoid getting into arrears
and being faced at some time later with a
large penalty. This matter has provoked a
lot of discussion, particularly among farmers;
and, as I have said, it has also raised a good
deal of resentment where, because of some
oversight resulting from lack of familiarity
with the complicated details, the taxpayer is
faced with these penalties.

Another cause of difficulty is that there are
very few income tax offices. In the city
where I live, a centre of 50,000 people, there
is no income tax office at all. If a man wants
to discuss some point connected with the tax
he must make an appointment beforehand
with a distant office and travel two hundred
miles to meet the official and talk over his
problem. This costs him a lot of money. As
a result there is a tendency to overlook the
tax altogether. I believe that if some sympathetic officer were located in these relatively smaller places, less trouble would
occur, there would be a better feeling about
the whole thing, and in the end the government would collect more revenue.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to make another speech; but
in citing the case of three different insurance
companies, one of which paid the tax
whereas the others paid no tax at all, I may
not have clinched by argument. What I
wanted to say was that, with the adoption
of this legislation, that sort of thing can no
longer occur. The new law may be made
retroactive-I do not know-to collect some
of the tax which has not been paid.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I would point out
to the house that if the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) speaks now
he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to say a few words on
the particular aspect of the bill which has
provoked the discussion today?
First, as regards stock companies other
than life insurance companies, whether they
be resident or non-resident, operating in the
insurance field, so far as our income tax law
was concerned, even prior to 1946 they were
subject to income tax on profits. Any discussion of the situation before 1946 in
relation to non-payment of taxes by some
non-resident companies, whether British or
foreign, must proceed on the basis of some
rule or regulation of the department whereunder an offset of head office expenses
against investment income was permissible.
But one starts with this general principle.
In 1945, when the royal commission sat, its
inquiry was directed to two phases: first, to
determine whether or not in the income of
co-operatives there was an element which
could or should be made subject to income
tax; second, whether in the operation of
mutual insurance companies other than life
insurance there was, similarly, any element
of their income to which income tax should

companies other than life companies applies
in relation to non-resident companies to the
year 1953. In relation to resident companies
it applies to the year 1954, which represents
a difference of one year. It is also provided
that when computing income tax for the
years 1947 to 1952, non-resident companies
must have regard and give effect to the
declaration providing that underwriting profits
and investment income are part of taxable
income. Resident companies, when computing
taxes for the years 1947 to 1953, must consider the question of investment income only.
Subsection 3 of section 15 says:
The said section 68A, except paragraphs (a) and
(b) thereof, is applicable in the case of a resident
corporation
(a) to the 1953 taxation year, and
(b) mutatis mutandis, in the computation of the
Income of the corporation under the Income War
Tax Act for the 1947 and 1948 taxation years and

taxation years . . .

Those paragraphs (a) and (b) of section
68A of the act deal with underwriting profits
and the rules of exemption. Paragraph (c) of
the same section deals with investment
income.

determining the income tax liability of nonresident corporations from 1947 down to 1954
inclusive, you have regard both to underwriting profits and to investment income.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Which was exempted
before.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. Clearly there is a
difference between the two classes of corporations, and to the extent that there is a
difference we should have a look at it and
decide whether that is fair or not. We must
assume it is a matter of policy, and I am
sure we shall hear from the proper officials
what that policy is when the bill goes to
committee. That is one difference. Another
difference is that we are granting treatment
arising as the result of the Stanley case, to
some extent, to resident companies and not
to non-resident companies. Whether they
should be entitled to it or not is another
question. It seems to me a sound principle
of law that if parliament had firmly fixed its
intention in 1946 to impose this method of
taxation on mutual companies to bring them
into line with the general law, but failed to
appreciate how precisely the language had

to be drawn to make the principle stick, and
because of the difficulties presented by the
Stanley case it is now intended to reaffirrn
that principle, you may well conclude that
the principle should be reaffirmed in its
entirety. Again, there may be questions of
policy at issue, and we shall have the opportunity to inquire about that in committee.
However, I think we should have a full
appreciation at this time of exactly what the
law was before the Stanley case arose, and
we should also know how this proposed legislation before us deals with the situation.
Certainly, there are changes and differences,
and it will be for us to decide in committee
whether or not we can reconcile them and
accept them in the light of decisions of policy
that have been made.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Before the bill is read
a second time, I would like to ask the mover
a question. The bill proposes to consider as
a stock dividend any distribution of increased
capital by a company. I should like to know
why that should be considered a distribution
of profits.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is not my understanding of the section. My understanding
is that where a company has a certain paid-up
capital, and where at the same time it has
undistributed income on hand-there must be
the two elements-then if the company
increases its paid-up capital the only way
it can do so is by delivering more shares
to its shareholders.
Hon. Mr. Howard: For consideration.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If you receive consideration for the additional shares that are issued,
thereby increasing your assets, this section
in the bill does not apply; but if you attempt
to increase your paid-up capital without
increasing your assets by the issue of those
additional shares, then the law will say, if
this bill becomes law, that you are presumed
to have capitalized your undistributed
mcome.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is all right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not understand
that very well.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask a question?
The Hon. the Speaker: Does the honourable senator consent?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.

experience in administration. There are perhaps ten or eleven items to which I should
briefly call your attention.
By item 848 the duty is being eliminated
on machinery, apparatus and parts of a class
or kind not made in Canada for use in the
development and operation of potash and rock
salt mines.
By item 1044 a former drawback item is
being re-established. Provision is made for
a drawback of 99 per cent of the duty paid
on fire clay, fire brick, when used by producers of iron or steel blast furnaces.
Item 437a provides for the duty-free entry
of materials and parts used in the repair of
railway signal systems, except as provided in
the general tariff.
Item 437b provides for the duty-free entry
of motor rail cars or units, of the selfpropelled single car type. Duties are suspended until July 1, 1956.
Item 237a covers uranium in the form of
pigs, ingots, billets or bars. The re-writing
of that items is based on the experience between Canada and the United States: at a
certain stage the material goes from Canada
to the United States, is worked on there,
comes back to Canada and is further processed here for export to the United States.
The arrangement between the two countries
in connection with the handling and pricing
of this product is that the price is exclusive
of duty; and no duty will be chargeable under
this item until after July 1, 1958.
There are several items under which the
tariff is being substantially reduced, one of
which is item 418a, dealing with devices for
the automatic control of the composition of
sterilizing and cleaning solutions.
Item 441g reduces the tariff on tear gas
ammunition for use by law enforcement
authorities, and item 546a lowers the tariff
on impregnated jute fabric used by nursery
men.
Heretofore persons have been allowed to
bring into the country, as settlers' effects, a
motor car to the value of $1,500; and if the
value was in excess of that amount, duty
was paid on the excess. By item 705a the
value of the motor car allowed in duty free
is increased to $2,500.
Item 704(b) provides for the free entry
of personal gifts not exceeding $25 in value,
sent by members of the Canadian armed
forces abroad to people in Canada. Heretofore
this item was taken care of by order in

council under the Emergency Powers Act, but
with the lapsing of that act, the item is
now being incorporated in the tariff.
I also should mention item 703 (c). Last
year we provided for the free entry of goods
valued at not more than $1,000 imported by
members of the Canadian forces after an
absence from Canada of not less than a year.
Item 703 (c) now abolishes that limit of
$1,000, and also extends the benefit of that
importation as well to employees of the
Canadian government returning from foreign
postings.
Honourable senators, those are the principal items.
Section 2 of the bill simply corrects a
printing error in the revision. There were
two items in the tariff bearing the same
number 402e, so all that section 2 does is
to declare that one of them shall be known
as 402c.
In section 3 you will notice that a number
of items are being struck out of the drawback section. These are items that have not
been used and in respect of which no claims
for drawback have been filed for a great
many years.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
10, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Crerar for the second reading of
Bill 469, an Act to authorize the provision
of moneys to meet certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National Railways
System during the calendar year 1954, and
to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty
of certain securities to be issued by the
Canadian National Railway Company.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few remarks before this
bill receives second reading, and I particularly wish to direct my remarks to the building of the proposed Canadian National hotel
in Montreal at an estimated cost of $20 million. Incidentally, I would like to remark

JUNE 15, 1954
that many of us are familiar with the fact
that in these days actual costs somehow or
other always exceed the estimate of cost. I
object to the building of this hotel. It is an
example of what happens when a government goes into business. We are all well
aware of the fact that the Canadian National
is a government railway, run and operated
by the dictates of the government. I am not
satisfied with many things that the Canadian
National Railway Company is doing. To my
way of thinking, it is engaged in some activities that a railway should not engage in, and
one of these is hotel keeping. I do not believe
that hotel keeping is any part of a railway's
business or any part of government business.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), in explaining the bill, tried
to justify construction of this hotel stating
there was a probability that the hotel would
be a profitable operation for the railway. He
mentioned, in illustration of his argument,
the number of rooms per 100,000 of population in some of the larger cities of Canada.
One of the cities was Vancouver. All honourable senators know, of course, that large
numbers of tourists are attracted to that city
because of its mild climate, an attraction
which any of our other cities do not have, and,
therefore, Vancouver would require relatively
more hotel rooms than other cities do. In
certain places hotels are more of a necessity
than in others, and to illustrate this I would
like to refer to some history on the subject.
First of all, we have the 2,000 year old story
of the inn where there was no accommodation
on the night our Saviour was born. Besides
inns, there were stopping places and these
stopping places were generally built at points
separated by the distance of a day's journey
and had nothing whatever to do with the
population at those particular points. In
fact, at some of them there might be no
population whatsoever. I have travelled in
the north where there is plenty of hotel
accommodation for tourist traffic only, and
none for the local population. In the old days
accommodation was provided for travellers' horses also. These stopping places then
consisted of a few rooms, and a large common room where a traveller had the privilege
of spreading his blanket. In this day and
age we have a new type of accommodation
that seems to me to be cutting into the business of the regular hotels. I am referring to
motels, which may be described as the
modern stopping places. As we travel along

the highways we see these motels or motor
courts, with circular drives leading up to
them, and adequate parking places, so that
you can drive your car in and take out your
luggage right at the very door of your room.
I am not satisfied with the management of
the beautiful hotel that we have here in
Ottawa. I have been told by people who have
travelled a good deal that they believe the
Chateau Laurier to be one of the finest hotels
in the world, and I do not doubt that it is.
It was built by the Grand Trunk Railway
many years ago, as were other railway hotels,
in the early days of railroading. The Macdonald Hotel at Edmonton was another hotel
project of that same railroad. Likewise, the
Canadian Pacifie hotels were built at a time
when there was no spare capital in the hands
of the people, when the insurance companies
were not burdened with funds as they are
today and insufficient private capital was
available to build the type of hotel that the
railway thought was needed at these crossroads. The Canadian Pacific Railway built
the Palliser hotel at Calgary, a city where
traffic seemed to concentrate, and therefore a
place where a hotel could be expected to produce profits for its owners.
I would just like to digress for a moment
to remark upon what a well planned hotel
the Palliser is. It was designed so that it
could be added to from time to time, and
it was added to since it was built some fortyfive years ago. No one who ever stayed
there could help admire the structure and
compliment the former directors of the Canadian Pacifie Railway on their vision. No
doubt the hotel was undertaken by the
directors after consultation with their shareholders. The citizens of Canada are shareholders in the Canadian National Railways
but are not consulted in such matters. The
building by the Canadian National Railways
of the Bessborough hotel in Saskatoon is one
example of shortsightedness. Although it cost
$2 million more than a similar hotel in
Regina which was built by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, it has some fifteen or twenty
fewer rooms, so there is a serious crimp in
revenue, for it is out of rooms that a hotel
chiefly makes money. The Bessborough is
located on a beautiful site. It has a roof
that must have cost as much as al the rest
of the hotel, a copper roof with gables all
over, a roof that has no place at ail on a

SENATE
building of that kind, for it makes it impossible to add a wing without spoiling the
appearance of the whole building. Yet it
should have another two hundred or three
hundred rooms just to break even.
As regards the Canadian National hotel
at Edmonton, I made representations to the
company over a period of nearly twenty years.
The hotel had a grand site and all the public
rooms necessary for it to function properly,
but there were not enough ordinary rooms to
make it possible for the hotel to pay.
Ultimately three hundred and fifty rooms
were added, and now the hotel is meeting
its expenses and serving a great and growing city.
So far as the Chateau Laurier is concerned,
I believe it could be managed more efficiently.
How long would a hotel remain solvent if its
main dining-room, one of the finest in the
world, was so poorly patronized that most of
the time the waiters outnumber the people
having meals there. The hotel is one of the
beauties of the world; but try to get to it!
Do American tourists patronize it at mealtimes? No, they remain on the outskirts of
Ottawa, where there is space for their cars.
I defy anyone who does not know the district
around the Chateau to drive to the hotel
without difficulty. He is more likely to shoot
on down past Sussex street, and find himself
in a bottleneck, and be obliged to turn
around and make his way back again. With
the cement promenade and the ground
adjoining it, there is enough space on which
to build an addition of two to three hundred
rooms. The hotel itself contains enough corridors, salons and alleyways to serve eleven
or twelve hundred rooms instead of the
existing five hundred and fifty. As it is now
operated it is better suited to millionaries and
the more exclusive type of patron than to the
ordinary guest.
There is no obvious reason why the Government of Canada should build another
huge hotel in Montreal. In fairly recent
years the 1100-roorn Laurentien has been
erected, and the island abounds with hotels
and motels which are used by great numbers
of visitors. What I am desperately concerned
about is that the governing body of the
Canadian National Railways shall pay strict
attention to what, to my mind, is their main
job, namely the carrying of freight as rapidly
and at as low a rate as is possible. As a
shareholder, it does not please me that an

important part of the Chateau Laurier is
occupied by a cocktail bar. Presumably space
will be found for several such resorts in the
Montreal hotel. I do not want any part in
such an enterprise. Here at the Chateau it
is not enough, apparently, to have a cocktail
bar, plus the "den of iniquity" in a hole
in the ground, but other quarters are provided which in an inn of the right kind
would serve an entirely different purpose,
and six or seven able-bodied men are going
around serving drinks. In one of our magazines, I believe it was Maclean's, the writer
of an article on the Chateau Laurier told us
that the manager changes his clothes three
times a day. What a great boost that kind
of performance gives to propaganda of the
hammer-and-sickle kind!
It is often said that this chamber is a place
for second thought. I suggest that this is
an occasion when we ought to "stop, look and
listen." We have the right and, I believe,
the duty to give service to the principle of
decentralization which is now being put into
practice. Until world conditions are more
settled, why should $20 million be spent to
further congest the centre of Montreal? The
whole trend nowadays is outward. Until
Montreal is provided with a subway, access
to the proposed new hotel will be no easier
than it is to the Chateau Laurier at the
present time.
I recall an occasion, long before I ever
thought it would be my lot to stand up in
this chamber, when the Senate received an
immense amount of abuse for having refused
its consent to a railroad charter which had
been passed in the other place. Had the road
been constructed it would have passed within
twenty miles of where I have lived for
forty-five years. The action of this chamber
on that occasion saved the country many
millions of dollars. To this day the greater
part of that area is in community pasture.
The proposed railroad was not built, and
never will be. Another opportunity is now
before the Senate to exercise its right and its
duty to say no.
It is getting late, and as I have expressed
my feelings in the matter I shall say no
more except to repeat that I am opposed to
the building of a Canadian National hotel
at Montreal at this time and to the voting of
any money for this purpose.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the debate
was adjourned.

On February 10, 1954, the following resolution
was adopted in the Senate:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons in the appointment of a Joint Committee
of both Houses of Parliament to inquire into and
report upon the questions whether the criminal

(b) corporal punishment or (c) lotteries, should be
amended in any respect and, if so, in what manner
and to what extent:

behalf of the Senate on the said Joint Committee,
namely, the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard, Bouffard, Farris, Ferguson, Hayden, Hodges,

That the committee have power to appoint, from

That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to report to the

accordingly.

On March 2, 1954, both houses of parliament
authorized the committee to retain the services of
counsel.
The original membership of the committee was
changed on February 15 by the substitution of Mrs.

SENATE
Ann Shipley, M.P., for Mr. John Decore, M.P., and
on March 5 by the substitution of Miss Sybil
Bennett, M.P., for Mr. G. W. Montgomery, M.P.
On February 17, the committee established a subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure which was
authorized, upon the adoption of its first and second
Reports, to prepare and arrange a schedule of witnesses with sittings to be held twice weekly insofar
as practicable.
The committee held its first sitting on February
17 for preliminary organization, meeting thereafter
at least twice weekly, except during the Easter
recess of parliament, until June 2 when the last
public hearing was held. Thereafter, the committee's proceedings were devoted to preparing its
report. In all, the committee held 30 meetings, ail
of which were in open session excepting parts of
those meetings devoted to discussions on procedure
or to preparation of its report. The subcommittee
held 17 meetings relating to the agenda and procedure of the Committee.
During the course of its inquiries, the committee
adduced evidence from individuals, organizations,
and governmental sources indicated in Schedule A
of the last issue (No. 18) of the committee's printed
proceedings. The committee also had access to
reports and documents, acquired or ordered for
reference by the committee, as listed in Schedule
B of the same issue of the proceedings. In addition, the committee received over 300 miscellaneous
reresentations in the form of letters, resolutions,
and petitions from individuals and organizations all
across Canada which were considered and analyzed
by the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure for
possible evidence or sources of information.
The committee wishes to express its gratitude for
the valuable assistance received from witnesses,
individuals, organizations and provincial governments who made oral representations or submitted
written evidence to the committee. In addition,
the committee very much appreciates the assistance
received from the Department of Justice, counsel to
the committee, and the committees branches of
both houses of parliament for their contributions in
facilitating the work and proceedings of the
Committee.
The committee, recognizing that it is in the
national interest to have a well informed public
opinion concerning the three subject matters it bas
been considering, desires to express its appreciation of the contribution made to this end by the
extensive and fair coverage given its proceedings
by the press and radio of Canada.
The committee urges that all national organizations interested in the problems before it, formulate their views during the parliamentary recess
and prepare to make their considered opinions
known to the committee at the next session.
The committee finds that it will not be able to
complete at the current session of this parliament
its inquiries into the matters referred to it for
report and, accordingly, recommends:
1. That a corresponding committee be established
and appointed early in the next session of this
Parliament to resume the studies and continue the
inquiries initiated by this committee.
2. That the government, in co-operation and
consultation with the provincial governments, consider the question of the revision of existing reporting and compilation procedures relating to criminal
statistics.
3. That the services of counsel to the committee
be retained on the same basis as presently author-

ized until the end of the current session of parlia-

ment for the purpose of completing certain inquiries
already instituted.
A copy of the committee's Minutes of Proceedings

and Evidence is tabled herewith.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Next sitting.

INCOME TAX BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-AMENDMENTS
CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. Hayden presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 467.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (467 from the
House of Commons) intituled: "An Act to amend
the Income Tax Act", have in obedience to the
order of reference of June 15, 1954, examined the
said bill and now beg leave to report the same with
the following amendments:
1. Page 1. line 4: strike out the words "Subsection (1) of".
2. Page 2, line 39: after the word "amount" insert
the word "actually".
3. Page 11, lines 24 and 25: delete lines 24 and 25
and substitute therefore the following:"(B) The said section 68A (except paragraphs (a)
and (b) thereof in the case of a mutual insurance
corporation) is applicable in the case of a resident
corporation".
4. Page 18, lines 13 to 16 both inclusive: delete
subclause (2) of clause 26 and substitute therefor
the following:"(2) This section is applicable
(a) to any acquisition of shares on or after May
31, 1954, and
(b) to any redemption of shares on or after
July 31, 1954, other than an acquisition or

corporation in respect of the redemption or acquisi- will have the following effect. In connection
tion of the shares was fixed, by or in accordance with any redemptions of preferred shares
with the law under which the corporation was
incorporated, on or before February 19, 1953, and after the date of the original amendment,
which was in February of last year, the 30
has not been increased since that day".

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these amendments be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden moved concurrence in
the amendments.
He said: Honourable senators, I think I
should give you a word of explanation on
these amendments. There are four of them,
but only two are important.
Substantially, one amendment has to do
with section 15 of the bill, which deals with
the taxation of mutual insurance corporations following the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in the Stanley Mutual Fire
Insurance case. The bill as it came to us
from the Commons contained amongst its
features an exemption of what are called
resident corporations in relation to underwriting profits for the years 1947 to 1953
inclusive. If this had been approved by the
Senate, having regard to the wording of the
section, not only mutual companies other
than life, but all resident insurance companies other than life, would have been entitled to the benefit of this exemption, and
this would have included mutual and stock
insurance companies other than life companies. When this was pointed out to the
officials and the minister, and that the section might carry a much broader meaning
than was intended, the departmental officers
had another look at it and decided that that
was quite true. Therefore we have the
amendment which now restricts the application of the exemption for the period 1947 to
1953 inclusive, in relation to underwriting
profits, to resident mutual insurance corporations. In the absence of some such provision,
there could very well have been a further
substantial refund by the department in
respect of taxes paid by stock insurance
corporations resident in Canada during the
period 1947 to 1953.
The other important amendment has to do
with the premium on redemption of preferred
shares.
Last year an amendment was
enacted under which a company whose shares
were being redeemed could pay a 20 per cent
tax on the amount of the premium, and the
premium would then go to the shareholder
as tax-paid income. A further amendment
was proposed by which, in all cases where the
premium on the redemption of preferred
shares is in excess of 10 per cent, the tax
83280-41

per cent tax will apply where the premium
is in excess of 10 per cent. After this bill
becomes law, shares redeemed at a premium
in excess of 10 per cent and which had been
created with that percentage of premium
prior to the enactment last year, will be
governed by the original enactment and the
tax will be 20 per cent and not 30 per cent.
They are just drawing the line so that it
could not be said that certain companies set
up such a capital structure, prior to the
enactment of the remedial legislation last
year, while having one eye on this section.
On the other hand, it could very well be said
that companies which created preferred
shares with a premium on redemption
higher than 10 per cent or which increased
the premium payable on redemption since
the amendment came into effect last year,
might possibly have done so with one eye
on the benefit being conferred in the section
being enacted. So the object is to divide one
from the other, and the amendment proposed
does that.
As to the other two amendments, one has
reference to a subsection which did not
exist. We therefore struck that reference
out. The other amendment simply involves
inserting the word "actually" in a sentence
so as to make a necessary distinction very
clear.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill, as amended, be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and
passed.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
THIRD READING
Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the third
reading of Bill 468, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

SENATE
EXCISE TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 447, an Act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the tax reductions in this year's budget will benefit
Canadian taxpayers to the extent of some
$36 million. Of this amount, $33 million will
arise from proposed changes in the legislation which we are to consider in this bill. A
convenient summary of the proposed changes
may be found in the resolution to amend the
Excise Tax Act introduced in the other house
on Tuesday, May 18, of this year, and appearing in the House of Commons Hansard at
page 4815. By way of* summary, the proposals are roughly as follows: First: A repeal
of the tax on some 15 items, including furs,
electrical appliances, firearms, some sporting
equipment, oil and gas burners, coal crushers,
certain road equipment used by municipalities, and other items, which will be discussed
later. Second: a reduction of the tax on 16
items, including toilet preparations, motorcycles, smokers' accessories, pens, tires, clocks
and some dishware. Third: alterations in the
tax on the packaging used to contain certain
goods, and on machines and tools for operation by tractors.
When I was preparing the material for the
explanation of this bill I was curious about
the history of the word "excise," but there
was very little of interest in the etymology
of the word. However, I read something
about its early history in England. The excise was originally a vehicle employed by
the early Stuart kings to raise revenue for
their purposes. Even in those days it was
considered to be a temporary measure, but
it seems to have acquired somewhat of a
permanent position in our tax structure
today. It was introduced in Scotland in the
early days of the 17th century, and according
to the records it was collected in that country
with great difficulty, particularly in the Highlands, for it is said that the Highlanders
gave the excise man a very unhappy time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And they always opposed
taxation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I think excise must have
been unpopular everywhere, because Dr.
Johnson defines it in his dictionary as "a
hateful tax levelled upon commodities." However, as the purpose of this bill is mainly tax
reduction to the extent of some $33 million,
I think perhaps we will not have too obnoxious a task to perform this afternoon.
Before I discuss the bill I would think it
quite appropriate to say that the minister
and the officials in the Department of National

Revenue who are charged with the administration of this legislation, perform their duties
in a manner which I am sure is considered to
be a credit to the public service of this
country by every member of this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: The collection of taxes
is never either a popular or a popularizing
procedure, but I know of no other department
of government where the rule of law is
applied more generally than it is in the
Department of National Revenue. In some
cases discretions are available to the officials,
but the fairness, equity and accommodation
which they show, as far as their duty and
the law will permit, is something which I
think we should from time to time record
with approval in this chamber.
Honourable senators, the Excise Tax Act,
which is Chapter 100 of the Revised Statutes
of Canada, was formerly known as the Special
War Revenue Act. There are in the mother
act some sixty-seven sections and four schedules. I think it important at this time to
mention the general scheme of the act in
order to get the context of the parts to be
amended.
Part I deals with taxes on insurance
premiums, and is the one part of the act that
is not administered in the Department of
National Revenue but in the Department of
Finance, through the Superintendent of
Insurance.
Part II, which was abolished last year,
dealt with taxes on cheques and negotiable
instruments. Part III, which was also
abolished last year, dealt with security transfer tax. I mention those two parts because
they are referred to in the amendments which
we are to consider.
Part IV deals with certain specified commodities, such as automobiles, toilet articles,
lighters, pens, smokers' accessories, jewelry,
clocks and candy, which are generally set
out in Schedule I to the bill.
Part V deals specifically with playing cards
and wines. Part VI has to do with sales tax,
or consumption tax; and Part VII is the
general section which deals with regulations,
licences, refunds and drawbacks on exported
and exempt goods, the keeping of records,
penalties, procedure and appeals.
That, honourable senators, is a general
survey of the act to be amended by this bill.
The bill itself contains fifteen sections.
Nine of the suggested amendments result from
budgetary changes, five are administrative
changes, and one restores a section which was
dropped by inadvertence last year. Perhaps
I should deal with the last item first, because
it is not of any great consequence. It is to

JUNE 16, 1954
be found in section 2. It prescribes who shall
sign returns made by insurance companies
in connection with the taxes on insurance
premiums. It is not a matter that we need
bother too much about.
With your permission, honourable senators,
I shall deal first with the administrative
changes, and afterwards with the budgetary
changes. Although this will necessitate taking certain sections out of their normal order
in the bill, it will be more convenient to
follow the amendments in this way.
Section 8 repeals section 39 of the act.
Playing cards are the only commodity upon
which a tax is now collected by means of
stamps. It is proposed that the provision
requiring the use of stamps might better be
left to the direction of the minister than be
provided for in the act. The section proposes that administrative change.
Section 9 simply provides a heading
between two sections of the act. Section 44
of the act deals with tax exemptions on
exported goods; and section 45 deals with the
liability of the crown for excise and sales
taxes. The purpose of the amendment is to
insert a heading between these two sections
saying that section 45 deals with the liability
of the crown.
Section 11 of the bill amends section 50
of the act by adding two new subsections.
By the first of these subsections there is provided a set-off of any money due to a taxpayer from the crown against any sum due
by a taxpayer to the crown under the act.
Perhaps I might best illustrate that by way
of an example. If a taxpayer has a contract
with the Department of Defence Production
under which he is owed, let us say, $1,000,
but he owes an excise tax of $200, perhaps
for the very goods that have gone into the
production of the goods on the contract with
the Department of Defence Production, the
amendment provides that instead of his being
paid $1,000 there can be a set-off, so that his
tax will be paid and he will receive the
difference. It seems to be an equitable provision and is in the interests of safeguarding
the revenue of the country.
The second subsection in section 11 deals
with the case where fines are levied against
a corporation in a criminal proceeding for
an offence under the Excise Tax Act. As
honourable senators know, when fines are
levied against individuals, the alternative to
the fine is a jail sentence. Now, a jail sentence cannot be carried out against a corporation. It is provided here that if a fine
is levied and is not paid in the normal course
by a corporation, the judgment of the
83280-41J

criminal court can be taken to the Exchequer
Court of Canada and made a judgment of
record in that court. Proceedings to execute
on the judgment so made of record under the
Exchequer Court rules can then be taken.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: In what way?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Perhaps I might give
an example. Corporation X is fined for an
offence under the act in a magistrate's court,
let us say, but does not pay the fine. The
judgment of the magistrate's court can then
be taken to the Exchequer Court of Canada
and, through the procedure proposed, it will
become a judgment of the Exchequer Court.
The rules of the Exchequer Court provide
methods for a seizure and a sale of assets, if
necessary, in order to realize on the judgment of the court. The amount of the judgment of the Exchequer Court in the case I
mentioned would be the amount of the fine
plus whatever costs were incurred in the
attempt to make the collection.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: May the registration
of the judgment in the Exchequer Court bemade before the time for appeal has elapsed,
or may it be made right away?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I would think that the
time within which the appeal can be taken
must first elapse. As my honourable friend
knows-and I think probably that is the
reason for the question-execution seldom
takes place in the civil courts until such time
as the period for appeal has expired, and
generally speaking that is the position. I
think the usual rules applicable to executions in civil proceedings would apply in this
case.
Section 12 is the next section to be considered. It repeals section 52, which has to
do with penalties imposed under parts II
and III of the act. Part II provides for the
placing of stamps on cheques and negotiable
instruments, and Part III provides for a
securities transfer tax. Since both these
parts have been repealed, the penalty section
52 is no longer required and so it is being
washed out.
Section 13 of the bill provides a time limit
within which the minister is entitled to lay
a complaint for violation of the act. Normally
the minister can lay a complaint within
three years from the time when the subjectmatter of the complaint first arose. Difficulties arise, of course, at times when the discovery is not made within the three-year
period. Under the act as it now stands the
minister can always lay a complaint within
six months after he discovers the subjectmatter of the complaint, even if the discovery
is made outside of the period of three years.
It is now proposed to extend that period of

SENATE
six months to a year. In other words, by this
amendment the minister would be allowed a
period of one year after he discovers the
subject-matter of a complaint, any time after
the initial three-year period, within which
to lay a charge in the criminal courts. I
may say that the section here is being made
to conform to section 136, subsection 4, of the
Income Tax Act.
I come now, honourable senators, to the
budgetary changes that are proposed by this
bill.
Section 1 proposes that purchasing authorities for the Northwest Territories and the
Yukon be placed on the same basis as provincial governments with respect to exemption from excise taxes. Section 46 of the
present act provides certain exemptions from
excise taxes for provincial governments, and
it is now proposed that those exemptions be
available to the administration of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.
Section 3 provides that both as to goods of
domestic manufacture and imported goods
the excise tax shall apply not only to the
goods themselves but as well to the packaging and also to any premium goods sold with
goods which attract the excise tax. Here,
perhaps, I should pause for a moment to
explain that the reason for this amendment
is that some time ago the Tariff Board ruled
that certain goods-goods alone-imported
in packages were dutiable for tariff purposes
under the appropriate section, and that packaging was not dutiable in the section. The
result was that the excise tax could be
imposed upon the goods only, not upon the
packaging, and this condition was deemed
unfair to the Canadian manufacturer, whose
packaged goods-that is, both the goods and
the package-attracted the tax. For that
reason this amendment is proposed, along
with a similar amendment by section 6 of
the bill in connection with the sales tax.
Section 4 provides for a rather unusual
situation. Under the law as it stands, lighter
fluids packaged and sold under a trade name
attract excise tax, and the person who so
packages and sells them under a trade name
is deemed to be a manufacturer. But a
person who buys in bulk the volatile fluids
that can be used for cigarette and cigar
lighters, breaks the bulk, and puts up the
fluid in packages, is not considered to be a
manufacturer. The purpose of the section is
to put this latter type of merchant in the
same class as the man who sells lighter fluids
under a trade name in a container for the
use of the taxpayer.

Section 5 of the bill repeals sections 24 and
25 of the act. These sections deal with the
tax on furs, and that tax is abolished by
this bill.
Section 7 of the bill deletes from section 32
of the act the two words "or importation".
The reason is this: Under Schedule IV of
the act, goods manufactured in Canada by
the blind, the deaf or the dumb attract only
50 per cent of the tax normally levied under
the act. The words "or importation" have
no place in the section, because if the goods
are manufactured in Canada by the blind, the
deaf or the dumb, obviously they cannot be
"goods imported".
A further amendment in the same section
provides for exemption from sales tax of
certain types of goods imported into Canada
under items 704 and 708 of the tariff. Under
item 704 of the tariff, goods of a personal or
of a household nature bequeathed to a Canadian resident by a resident of another country
dying abroad are allowed entry duty-free.
Heretofore they have attracted excise tax
because of the fact of their importation. It
is now proposed that they should not attract
that tax. The same exemption is to apply
to importations by NATO forces in Canada
for whom goods are brought in under what
is called the Status of Forces Act.
By section 10 it is proposed to apply the
drawback rather than the refund procedure
when goods for ships' stores or for aircraft
are purchased in Canada. I am informed
that the drawback procedure is more satisfactory, not only from a departmental but
from the taxpayers' point of view.
The only other point I will mention in this
very disjointed type of explanation is connected with the three schedules, which will
be found at the back of the bill. Schedule I
lists items which are subject to income tax,
and the tax applied is an ad valorem tax.
Schedule II lists the goods which are subject
to excise tax and to which a specific tax is
applied, that tax being one based on weight
or measurement. Schedule III contains the
exemptions; and I may say that this schedule
has been completely redrawn. The entire
list of exemptions is rewritten, with the
additional items that have been exempted
from the tax, as a result of this year's budget.
If the honourable senators will refer to
Schedule I, they will observe that for the
most part the tax reductions are from 15 to
10 per cent.
As regards Schedule II, one item has been
changed, the tax on carbonic acid gas and
similar preparations for aerating nonalcoholic beverages having been reduced from
25 cents to 15 cents per pound.

JUNE 16, 1954
I do not propose to comment on Schedule
III, other than to mention that the additional
exemptions are underlined, and that the
schedule contains a complete list of all
articles which are now to be exempt from
tax under the Excise Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the honourable senator
any information as to the amounts of money
collected on radios, television sets and other
dutiable goods? For instance, what amount
was received by way of sales tax as against
excise taxes? Can the honourable senator
give us the total for last year?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: The total excise taxes
collected under the act for the fiscal year
1953-54 were $1,052,502,931. The amount of
sales tax collected in the same fiscal period,
according to my information, was $755,237,251.
On television sets in the same fiscal period
the amount collected was $11,710,222. Perhaps I should add, as I assume that my honourable friend is interested in the amounts
that are earmarked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, that $5,060,778 was collected on radios, phonographs and record
players.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I do not intend to speak at length in
connection with this bill, for I expect that it
will be referred to committee where certain
amendments could possibly be made to it.
I should like to commend the government
for reducing the tax on certain articles, but
I want to refer to two sections of the bill
which seem to me to go a little too far.
Subsection (2) of section 11 amends section
50 of the act by adding thereto the following
subsection:
(13) Where a corporation has been convicted of
an offence under this act and a pecuniary penalty
has been imposed by the conviction, the amount of
the penalty may, by filing the conviction or a certified copy thereof in the Exchequer Court of Canada,
be entered as a judgment of that court, and that
judgment is enforceable against the accused in
the same manner as if it were a judgment rendered
against the accused in that court in civil proceedings.

I may be wrong, but I am inclined to think
that if a person who has been convicted has a
right of appeal, the time limit for filing his
appeal should elapse before his conviction
can be entered as a judgment of the
Exchequer Court. This section goes so far as
to provide that if a convicted person has
appealed the conviction may be entered as
a judgment of the Exchequer Court and the
judgment executed before the appeal has
been decided. It seems to me that the conviction should not be entered as a judgment
of the Exchequer Court pending the time of

appeal or during the appeal. The Income
Tax Act provides that a judgment of the
Exchequer Court may be executed, even if
an appeal has been launched, so I think it is
perfectly unreasonable to start all over again,
when dealing with the Excise Tax Act, to
have judgments executed before final disposition of an appeal.
I refer now to section 13 of the bill, which
provides that section 62 of the act be repealed
and the following substituted therefor:
62. An information or complaint under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to summary
convictions, in respect of an offence under this Act
may be laid or made on or before a day three years
from the time when the matter of the information
or complaint arose or within one year from the day
on which evidence, sufficient in the opinion of the
Minister to justify a prosecution of the offence,
came to his knowledge, and the minister's certificate as to the day on which such evidence came
to his knowledge is conclusive evidence thereof.

How soon must the complaint be laid? Is
it within three years, for instance, or could
it be a year after the minister has got the
necessary information? It seems to me that
the department has a choice, and if that is so
a period of even ten years may elapse after
an offence has been committed before a
complaint is laid, so long as the minister issues
a certificate to the effect that be has not had
knowledge of the offence for more than a
year. Honourable senators will observe that
the word "notice" is left out of the proposed
new section 62, which says a complaint may
be laid:
-within one year from the day on which evidence
sufficient in the opinion of the minister to justify
a prosecution for the offence, came to his knowledge ...

It seems to me that the period which may
elapse before a complaint is laid is rather
extensive. It may be three, ten or even
twenty years so long as the minister certifies
that he has not had knowledge of the offence
for more than a year; yet that knowledge
could be in his department for a long time
without coming to his notice.
I feel that the two sections I have referred
to should be given further consideration in
committee.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
anticipating that the sponsor of this bill (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) intends to refer it to committee, I would request him to ask the appropriate departmental officials to outline the
principle under which these reductions are
being proposed. After listening in the other
house to the Minister of Finance I had the
impression that these reductions deal for the
most part with articles upon which the government has not been getting large sums of

SENATE

of the complaint within that time-even ten
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is fine.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: In connection with the
remarks made by the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) about section
11 of the bill, I should refer the house to a
similar provision that we passed in Bill 7,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code. I refer
to section 623, which provides for the recovery of fines. In that case the recovery was to
be made through the provincial Superior
Court of competent jurisdiction, whereas in
the case before us under the Excise Tax Bill,
the fine is an amount due to Her Majesty, and
therefore the appropriate court is the
Exchequer Court.
Mutatis mutandis, section 623 of the
Criminal Code is the basis for the amendment
provided in section 11 of the bill before the
house.
As to the time within which the certificate
of the Criminal Court can be lodged in the
Exchequer Court, I would draw to the
attention of the honourable senator the last
two lines in the subsection, which read:
that judgment is enforceable against the accused
in the same manner as if it were a judgment
rendered against the accused in that court in civil
proceedings.
I have not the Exchequer Court rules with

me, but I take it that the rules would
provide that an execution in that court should
not take place without the special intervention
of that court until the time within which
an appeal could be launched had expired.
In other words, if a writ of execution is
applied for before the time had expired to
launch an appeal, I think a stop order on
the execution-

years after, as my honourable friend has
said-the certificate of the minister as to
when he discovered the complaint is final and
conclusive so far as the courts are concerned.
From that time be has one year within which
to lodge his complaint in the criminal courts.
I do not think there is any dispute about
that point at all. Although two wrongs do
not make a right-and both provisions may
be wrong-the same provisions apply in the
Income Tax Act as are now applied here. In
this case, the purpose of the amendment
is to extend the time within which the minister can lodge his complaint in the criminal
courts from six months to a year. If the
minister is entitled to an extension of time
at all, I think it is reasonable to say that
be should be granted that length of time; and
under the Income Tax Act it is deemed to
be an appropriate length of time. However,
I agree with my honourable friend that it is
a matter that might well be discussed by
the committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly the bill

Banking and Commerce.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Crerar for the second reading of Bill 469, an

JUNE 16, 1954
Act to authorize the provision of moneys to
meet certain capital expenditures of the
Canadian National Railways System during
the calendar year 1954, and to authorize the
guarantee by Her Majesty of certain securities
to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
there are many matters which I should like
to deal with in my discussion on this bill
this afternoon, but I assure the bouse that
my remarks will not be lengthy. I am particularly interested in the measure by reason
of a question about a proposed hotel to be
built in Montreal which I asked of the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), who explained the bill; however, I
intend to pass briefly over some of the other
provisions of the bill and leave to the end
of my remarks any comments on the hotel.
The bill at one place directs our attention
to the fact that the Canadian National Railways are interested in the Trans-Canada Air
Lines. Regarding air line service, I would
like to say that I have never been able to
understand why the capital city of Ottawa
bas been left off the North Star route. Passengers leaving Ottawa for the coast must take a
smaller plane and transfer to a North Star
plane in Toronto, where they may have to
wait as long as one or perhaps two and a
half hours to get the west-bound plane. On
eastbound flights I have observed that most
passengers who leave Vancouver are destined
for Toronto or Ottawa, and few travel as
far east as Montreal, which means that most
of the passengers for Ottawa leave the North
Star plane at Toronto and take a smaller
plane to Ottawa. I have never had a satisfactory answer as to why Ottawa is not served
by larger, modern and faster planes. Without
wishing to be unkind to honourable senators
from the prairie provinces, I would point out
that the North Star planes drop down at
such smaller cities as Saskatoon or Regina.
Why do they stop at less populated, and perhaps less important, places and not at the
capital city here?
The bill before us forecasts a large expenditure for diesel engines. But before dealing
directly with that item, may I say that I
sincerely sympathize with the President of
the C.N.R. in the problems he faces. In my
opinion, while great things were expected
of him, he was given an impossible task, for
no one man can do all that should be done
to effect the improvements which should be
brought about if the railway is to be placed
on a better financial and operating footing.
To illustrate the failure of the C.N.R. to
keep abreast of the times, may I point out
that it takes the same number of hours to

come from New Westminster to Ottawa today
as it took in 1930 when I first became a member of the House of Commons. Notwithstanding the fact that we are living in a different
age and that railways have to -meet competition from air transport and even from
bus lines, the transcontinental rail service
remains the same. It may be of interest to
honourable senators to know that by travelling south from Vancouver 120 miles to
Seattle I can come east by the Great Northern
Railway and arrive in Ottawa sixteen hours
earlier than if I take either the C.N.R. or
the C.P.R. I have made the statement on
many occasions, and it bas never been refuted,
that if it were not for the fact that the
C.N.R. is held to the time schedule of the
C.P.R., it could cut its time from Vancouver
to Ottawa by eight to ten hours. But of
course if the C.N.R. made such a change, it
would immediately capture most of the
passenger traffic on the transcontinental lines.
Now that it bas been decided to purchase
diesel engines capable of greater speed than
steam locomotives, why cannot the C.N.R.
meet the competition by air on its transcontinental line? If it is possible for a railway
in the United States to make the trip faster
by sixteen hours, why cannot the C.N.R. do
better than it does. I read a recent article
in the magazine Monsanto which told an
interesting story about the accomplishments
of the Great Northern Railway, and in particular stated that the use of diesel power
enables the line to carry ninety cars of freight
at a speed of fifty miles an hour, and mail
and passengers at seventy miles an hour,
from the central states to the west coast. I
think it is time that some study was made
of the modern rail service available in the
United States. Canada should be able to
match that service, at least in travelling
time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are the rates in the United
States the same as in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Speaking of passenger
rates, one can travel east cheaper from
Seattle via the American line than from Vancouver by C.N.R. or C.P.R. In freight rate
debates in the other house, I have quoted
rates in the United States that were lower
on certain articles and goods than the rates
paid by the people of British Columbia. Of
course, freight rates are an involved subject,
and I will make only that general statement,
which I think I can substantiate.
Two years ago, when a bill similar to the
one now before us was being considered in
committee, I asked a question as to why the
C.N.R. was buying a number of railway cars
to transport motor cars from the province of

SENATE
Ontario to the prairie provinces and British
Columbia, when it was a well-known fact
that motor cars were then being carried
much more cheaply by fleets of motor transport trucks across the country. I mention
that matter because I note with interest that
at this late date the railways have made
application to the Board of Transport Commissioners for a change in rates to help them
meet the competition from motor transport.
It seems strange that they would spend the
money they did on railway cars two years
ago if they were not prepared at that time
to meet the competition of motor transports.
The motor transports are of course able to
pick up cars at the factory and deliver them
to salesrooms in Vancouver at a lower rate
than they can be shipped by rail. I have
never received a satisfactory answer to my
question. As honourable senators know, we
in British Columbia are obliged to pay from
$300 to $500 more for our cars by reason
of the freight costs.

staff in charge of the supervising and clerical
end of the dining car operations, you would
find out why meals are costing so much". He
stated that at every large centre they have a
large number of officials, with titles such as
dining car superintendent, assistant dining
car superintendent and so on; and other kinds
of superintendents and assistant superintendents, all down the line. They have a superintendent of towel service, a superintendent
of this and a superintendent of that.
I say that the president can do nothing
much about this. Just try to get rid of men
who are employed on the railway and who
are heavily unionized these days. It is just
impossible. It simply cannot be done. When
I say that I am in sympathy with the president, I mean it. He was chosen to revolutionize the whole railway and put it on its
feet, but he is meeting with difficulties that
neither he nor any other man can correct.
Coming to the question of the hotel, I want
to convey this message to the president too
that if he and his officials want to hear something of the railway, let them travel in the
ordinary coaches and listen to the comments
of the rank and file, instead of travelling in
their special cars off by themselves. If they
were to do this they would probably hear
something that would change some of their
ideas. One thing I have heard in my travels
in talking to the various railway men is
that, for some reason or other, they are not
given the moral support that they should
have. They are therefore not as enthused
as they were in the days of Sir Henry
Thornton-not on the Canadian National
Railways, anyway-and I say that without
that moral support and enthusiasm men do
not give of their best.
I have spoken to many men coming down
on the train. I spoke to one in particular
who knew before I did that this hotel was
going to be built. I said to him, "You railwaymen are asking for more salaries and
wages this year," and he said "Yes, why not?
When the Canadian National have $20 million
available to build a hotel that they should not
be bothering about, why should we not get
into a little too?"

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interject a question?
When did that motor transport operation
start?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would say about eight
years ago. There is a regular fleet, and the
vehicles usually travel in pairs. The drivers
are allowed a certain length of time and a
certain number of days after they arrive
there to rest up. It must be far cheaper
than transporting cars by railway, or else
the railways would not have lost that traffic.
You do not see railway cars nowadays loaded
with automobiles. I say that the railways
had no reason to lose that business and would
not have lost it if they had endeavoured to
meet the competition.
I could mention something more in support
of what I said a few minutes ago as to my
sympathies with the president, and I come
now to the question of meals on trains again.
I might say in passing that I noticed the
other day that four important personages
from Great Britain were travelling across
Canada by the Canadian National, and when
asked how they liked the trip their only complaint was about the cost of meals. They
said they liked the trip very much but they
did not know how Canadians could afford to
pay such high prices for meals on trains. The

Hon. Mr. Reid: I find no such complaints
by the staff of the C.P.R.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They are not enthusiastie
either?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I see no difference from
former days in the enthusiasm of the C.P.R.
employees. When I travelled down here first,
in 1930, every man on the Canadian National
was a fighting man for the railway; he was
willing to go to any lengths to help it; but you
do not find that on the C.N.R. today. Talking
about the Canadian Pacifie employees, I see
no difference.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the reason for
that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Unionization, if you want
to know.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will tell you one of the
reasons given to me. The rank and file
resented the appointment to the high post of
president of a man who was not a railway
man.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear. That is something.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I did not want to say it,
but you asked me, and that is one reason
I got from employees working on the railway.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me ask a question here.
If that condition exists on the Canadian
National, why is not the reverse true of the
Canadian Pacifie, because a railway man pure
and simple is president of that railway.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Perhaps I did not make my
explanation clear. I was asked a few minutes ago by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) a question regarding the two railways. I said when I came
down here in 1930 I saw a great spirit of
enthusiasm among the Canadian National
employees, a spirit that does not exist today.
I also sait that I find no difference from
former days in the attitude of the C.P.R.
employees or officials. When it is a question
of the Canadian National, though, I say that
the former friendly feeling has changed over
the past years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt,
but in both cases you say there is now no
enthusiasm on the part of the employees?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, I did not say that. I
said there was little enthusiasm on the part
of the Canadian National employees.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I asked you if there was
any difference as between the two railways.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I can say that on the Canadian National they are not as enthusiastic as
they were in the 1930's.
83280--42

Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, I see.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If I did not say that, I want
to say it now and make it clear.
I am not going to deal with the question
of changing over from coal burning to oil
burning engines or from steam locomotives
to diesel locomotives. All I am going to say
is that there was a time when we did consider the economie position and condition of
many of our people. This change over to
oil is going to affect the coal producing districts, but I am not going into a discussion
on that, other than to say that I was surprised by the information I received the
other day from a source outside of the railway. He is the manager of a plant-I do not
mind being frank about it-that creosotes ties
for the Canadian National Railways. He was
not speaking to me principally about Canadian National ties or Canadian National operations, but he told me: "Senator Reid, you
will be surprised to know that it is the policy
of the Canadian National Railways this year
to cut down on tie replacements, and as a
result I have had to lay off a few men". I
said, "Why do you have to do that?" "Well,"
he said, "the Canadian National are economizing on ties this year on their line". He said
they usually replace 130 ties per mile of
track per year but this year they have cut
down on that replacement, not that the ties
do not need to be replaced or that they have
not a large quantity of ties on hand, but
they are now spending plenty on hotels.
I just cannot get the thinking that is in the
heads of the railway, if that information is
correct. The man who made that statement
is a reliable citizen, but I am not going to
reveal his name. He is located in the city
of Montreal, and he came up here on other
business entirely. He has plants throughout
Canada where they are laying off a few men
here and there because, he states, the Canadian National Railways are cutting down the
replacement of ties in order to save money.
But there will be no money saved, because
ties keep deteriorating year by year and what
you do not replace this year you are going
to have to replace next year.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: That expenditure comes
under maintenance.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Surely if anything should
be kept up it is the roadbed. Tie replacement
is like the removal of the mud in the Fraser
River; if you do not do the work today you
will have twice as much to do tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The building of a hotel
is a capital expenditure.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. They are cutting down
on ties, but at the sane time, he said, they
are going in to the hotel business in a big
way.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable gentleman not know that those who accuse the
railroad authorities of paring expenditure on
ties to provide money for building hotels
are misinformed? Surely he knows that that
is not so.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not altogether surprised by that interruption. I expected that
those who come frorn the province within
which this great hotel is to be built would
try to defend the expenditure.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The capital required to
build the hotel will not be obtained in the way
that has been suggested.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I shall give honourable
senators the story of the C.N.R. hotel business,
and if, when I have done, they have anything
to say, I shall be glad to hear them. What
I am about to state is not hearsay; it is taken
from official records. They show that the
Canadian National hotel system, consisting
of twelve hotels, is not paying interest on
the capital which was expended to build
them. I have here the details, showing the
expenses, the earnings, and the amount of
the surplus.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Canadian National Railway
hotels?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The Canadian National
Railway hotels-twelve of them-yes.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: What is the rate of
interest they are paying?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable gentleman inform us what series of years he is
referring to?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will. The record goes
back to 1947. I am citing the latest figures,
those relating to 1953, because I think last
year's statistics are an accurate criterion.
But the information relating to the entire
period can be easily produced in committee.
The total cost of the twelve hotels was
$38,111,820. I have here, for instance, data
showing the cost of the Chateau Laurier and
how many roons it contains; also, which
hotel has the largest surplus and which ones
have deficits.
Hon. Mr. Vien: What is the source of the
honourable gentleman's information?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The annual report of the
Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In detail?

Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. My other source of
information is the evidence placed before
the House of Commons Special Committee on
Railways and Shipping this year at the
request of Mr. Pouliot by Mr. Donald Gordon
and some of his head officials. The material
may be found at page 244, Minutes of
Proceedings No. 1.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is there a breakdown as
to the various hotels?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Each Canadian National
hotel is individually referred to here.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What year does that
material cover?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The report which was
rendered to parliament by this special conmittee includes the returns from 1947 to
1953.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is that from this year's
Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is in the report of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Vien: This session?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Right. The material can
easily be made available in convenient forrn
to members of the Senate committee.
I take it that 3 per cent would be a
reasonable return on money invested in
C.N.R. business. I know many would not
be content with so small a return, but we are
dealing with governmental expenditures.
Anyway there should be a return of 3 per
cent on the $38,000,000 investment in these
twelve hotels. On that basis, the amount
necessary would be $1,140,000.
In fact,
however, the surplus from all the hotels was
only $874,814. But in two cases there were
deficits, of a total of $380,808.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What percentage is
represented by the surplus?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Percentage of what?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At 3 per cent,
according to your figures, the surplus should
be over $1,100,000. What percentage of the
investment is $800,000?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have not worked it out,
but it would be around 2 per cent. But the
actual surplus did not amount to $874,814.
When the deficit of $380,000 is subtracted,
the net to the government is only about
$496,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is ail the corpany

Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable Leader of
the Government did not wait until I finished
my story. Had be done so he might not have
asked me about the percentage.

Hon. Mr. Euler: In that case may I have
permission to ask my colleague a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It has been stated that
the operations of the Chateau Laurier last
year resulted in a profit of $421,831. I should
like to know whether that amount represents
net profit after allowing for depreciation and
interest on investment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not think so, for these
headings refer to revenues, expenses and
taxes, and net income. I take it that the
expenses cover the cost of operating the
hotels; the revenues cover the moneys taken
in by the hotels, and the figure I have given
represents what is left after taxes have been
deducted.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is the operating revenue.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That can be verified in committee. My information is that it does not
touch depreciation or interest.
Honourable senators, I am not at all
enthused about spending $20 million to construct a new hotel in Montreal. If Montreal
needs a new hotel I would like to know how
many people in that city would be willing
to subscribe money for its construction. As
long as the state is putting up the money
everybody in Montreal is for it. Does the
house realize that the interest alone on the
construction of this hotel would amount to
$600,000 a year? I maintain that we had
better take stock before we allow the C.N.R.
to build a new hotel of the magnitude of
1,000 rooms. A day or two ago when Mr.
Robert R. Young, one of the greatest railroad
men in the United States, took over control of
the New York Central Railroad, he said that
he was a railroad man, not a hotel man, and
that he was getting out of the hotel business.
His statement should be given serious consideration. I know how easy it is to sell
Montreal people the idea of building a big
hotel in their city, but I am looking at this
from the point of view of the Canadian taxpayer. I say that the Canadian National, as
a railway company, has no right to enter into
this venture. If the city of Montreal needs
a hotel, then let the city or its people build it,
for in my opinion the hotel would not bring
any additional revenue to the railroad. The
day is gone when railroads in this country
should be building hotels, and for this and
other reasons I strenuously protest spending
money for this purpose.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I quite appreciate the fact that I am
unable to present my case in the same
vigorous manner as our esteemed colleague
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I
shall endeavour to confine my remarks to one
phase of the legislation, but first I should
like to comment on certain criticisms made
in connection with C.N.R. hotels.
Yesterday afternoon the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
expressed himself as critical of the operation
of these hotels, as the honourable senator

from New Westminster bas just done. A
group headed by Robert R. Young recently
won a hard fight to gain control of the New
York Central Railroad, and upon taking over
control Mr. Young stated that he was a railroad man and that he was not going to
operate in the hotel business. Be that as it
may, there are two thoughts on the subject.
I am inclined to feel that any railway system
today will find it rather difficult to carry on
its transportation system without operating,
as it were, in the hotel business.
Hon. Mr. King: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That statement is open to
question, but I feel that the figures just presented by the honourable senator from New
Westminster do not present a bad picture.
I was particularly interested in the showing
made by the Nova Scotian Hotel in Halifax,
for in a matter of this kind one naturally
thinks of the hotel nearest home. I have
watched its operations and those of the
Chateau Laurier here at Ottawa. Both these
hotels give wonderful service. It is true that
the price of meals in their dining rooms
could be criticized, but the preparation and
serving of meals is only part of the hotel
business. The renting of rooms is the main
source of revenue. As I recall the formula
used years ago, if a hotel could keep 65 per
cent of its rooms occupied it was a paying
proposition. I am not sure that those figures
apply today, but judging from the number of
people who do not have reservations and
have to line up and wait their turn for rooms
in the two hotels I have mentioned, hotels
today operate at pretty high efficiency in so
far as the renting of rooms is concerned.
Honourable senators, while I am going to
deal particularly with one phase of the bill,
because of the effect it is having on my own
province, I want it to be understood that I
am not critical of any progress being made
by way of the changeover from coal to oil,
if it benefits the whole of Canada and not
only one part.
I think we must also face the fact that the
Canadian National Railways system is more
or less a public utility-certainly it is publicly
owned. In recalling the history of Canada,
when one thinks of the terms of confederation, and the entry of the Maritimes, and the
moneys expended in the construction of steel
rails from east to west, surely it is clear that
the public men of that day had in mind a
public utility for building up the economy
of our whole country. Of course, the Maritimes suffered after confederation, while the
central and western provinces progressed and
enjoyed the prosperity that resulted from
expenditure on railway construction.

even the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) would be proud to be
a shareholder.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators after the rather strong attacks that have
been made on the proposal to build a hotel
in Montreal at a cost of $20 million, first of
all by the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) yesterday, and this
afternoon by the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), I think it
is hardly surprising but rather what the
house would expect that one of the senators
from Montreal should have a few remarks to
make in answer to the criticisms that have
been expressed. In doing so, honourable senators, I am not conscious that though I do
happen to come from Montreal I am thereby
necessarily prejudiced in favour of this
rather large capital expenditure. I can tell
the house quite frankly that if I thought this
expenditure was unjustified, I think that my
position as a member of the parliament of
Canada would forcibly make it necessary for
me to oppose it if I felt that that was the
position which conscience called upon me to
take.
Now, that is not the case in connection with
this proposal to build a new hotel in Montreal. The first consideration that comes to my
mind in connection with it is this one: I have
a great deal of faith in the sagacity and the
good judgment of the men who operate the
Canadian National Railways, at the present
time headed by Mr. Donald Gordon, and I
think I would be willing to rely on their
opinion that the construction of a hotel in
Montreal at the present time will not add to
the deficits of the C.N.R.
We have had a good deal of experience
in the last few years in connection with proposals that have been advanced to us by
officials of the C.N.R. for construction of new
lines of railway and so forth, and I have
always been impressed by the fact that those
suggestions have invariably been supported
by statements and figures, showing that the
officials were very conscious of the necessity
of justifying any capital expenditure by the
additional revenue which would accrue therefrom to the railway. So I say, basically I am
willing to accept as a general principle the
statement which has been made by the president of the C.N.R. that from a financial point
of view he considers the construction of this
hotel to be advantageous for the railway. And
I think any honourable senator who knows
the situation in Montreal and has knowledge
of the location in which it is intended to build
this hotel will realize that it is perhaps

about the most favourable set of circumstances that you could possibly imagine in
any place for the construction of a hotel.
In the first place, it is to be built on the
terminal property of the C.N.R., on property
already owned by the railway company. Not
a cent of money is to be spent for acquisition
of land. The land is already owned. Part of
it is already built upon by the present station and the hotel is to be built above the
present station.
Secondly, so far as this location is concerned, in relation to the principal business
centres of the city its position could not be
It is almost exactly half-way
improved.
between the great downtown business section of the city centered around St. James's
street, on the one hand, and the great uptown
shopping section of the city running along
St. Catherine street, on the other.
In the third place, the hotel will be built
next to the C.N.R.'s central station which, of
course, means that it will be likely to attract
a lot of traffic from train passengers. But I
point out to the house this additional consideration, that in the very same block there
is the air terminus building, to and from
which go all the buses operating between the
city and the airport.
So the hotel will
be built not only in the centre of railway
travel represented by the central station, but
in the centre of air travel, represented by the
air terminus in Montreal; and from that point
of view, the location could not be improved
upon.
Now, there is a great deal of advantage
in having a first-rate hotel in juxtaposition
to a railway station, and we see that in a
large number of cities on this continent.
Both the big railroad stations in New York
have hotels within a block of them. The
Union Station in Toronto has the C.P.R.
hotel just across the street from it, and both
stations in Winnipeg are similarly favoured.
The unfortunate part about Montreal is that
at the present time none of the present hotels
are within a block or two blocks of either
of the big stations. I listened with a great
deal of interest to my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) and
the figures which he produced. I am inclined
to differ with his conclusions about the actual
results of operations of the C.N.R. hotel system during the year 1953; because while, as
he very properly admitted, ten out of the
twelve hotels produced net revenues of
$850,000 after expenses, the other two hotels,
which produced deficits, were subject to
very exceptional conditions at that time. He
mentioned the hotel at Edmonton which is
by way of being enlarged, and in respect of
which the deficit is largely accounted for by

JUNE 16, 1954
the additional cost resulting from the enlargement. He also mentioned the Jasper
Park Lodge which, as honourable senators
know, two years ago suffered complete
destruction by fire. So in a normal year one
could expect that the present C.N.R. hotels
would produce sufficient revenue to pay at
least a moderate rate of interest on the
capital which is being employed in them.
I repeat: I am certain that the officials
of the Canadian National Railways would
not have recommended to parliament the
construction of this hotel at the present time
had they not believed that the financial position of the railroad would at any rate not
be worsened as a result of the capital
expenditures which they are calling upon us
to approve.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) objected to the government
being in business. I do not think that the
government goes directly into business as a
result of the operation of hotels by the
Canadian National Railways. I do not think
anybody can claim that the management of
the Canadian National Railways or the management of the hotels is interfered with by
the government as a result of the ownership
of these hotels by the railroad. I point out
to him that in many other countries similar
conditions apply. Take, for instance, Great
Britain, where a comparatively large number
of hotels which were owned by individual
railway companies before the railways were
nationalized are still owned by the government. There are other countries in which
much the same situation exists. I think, if
you look over the general picture, you will
see there is a good deal of force in the
argument that the hotel business, certainly
in some respects and in some localities, is
an integral and a very proper part of the
railway undertaking.
For these reasons, and subject of course
to what we may hear when this bill goes to
committee, I am disposed to think that the
expenditure which the Canadian National
Railways are now asking parliament to
approve is a wise one.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I am not particularly anxious to join in the
debate, but I would like to draw attention to
one or two things which, I suggest have been
overlooked. Apparently the main criticism is
directed against the item for the construction of a hotel at Montreal. If the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) and the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) were to
address their arguments to me as a businessman-and this is what I pretend to be-I
would think their contentions were unanswerable. I would not put a split nickel into any

proposition of the kind they have been criticizing. I do not suppose that any honourable senator who has any regard for his
investments would put a nickel into it, either,
since the earning power of the hotels is
insufficient to meet a charge of 3 per cent,
and only last December the Canadian
National Railways sold 3j% bonds, guaranteed by the government at, I believe, 99. I
happen to know about this issue because I
was sick at the time, and an agent got me
to buy some of it.
I do not want to go into the hotel question,
except to say that I can understand that any
honourable senator from Montreal or the district of Montreal would support this proposal. If I lived there, and faced the situation regarding hotel accommodation which
exists there, no doubt I would favour the
building of another hotel. But the conviction
which possesses my mind, and which does
not imply criticism of the government or
anyone else, is, that our Canadian economy
is now at the crossroads. I repeat-admitting
that any honourable senator may tell me I
am out of order-that we, along with the
world in general, are confronting an economic
crisis. No longer have we a sellers' market;
we are now in a buyers' market; and we
should be very careful what we do with our
capital. Thirty per cent of the employed
population of this country are engaged in
producing for the export trade, and it is by
that trade they live. I am persuaded that
this proposed hotel or any other of the game
character could be built five years from now
for less money than it would cost today. If
the project were the construction of houses
one might be told, "Mr. Haig, people must
have some place to live." But I have heard
no answer to the point which was raised by
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner). He remarked that on
recent trips to the United States he observed
that motels are having a very serious effect
on the hotel business.
As regards the area in which the proposed
hotel will be located, I do not know where
in the vicinity one could park a car if he
wanted to. I have not been in Montreal for
a couple of years, but the last time I was
there the district was closely built up, and
with the possible exception of Dominion
Square, which is no great distance away,
absolutely no parking space is available.
There is some talk of constructing facilities
underground for this pi.urposeý I do not
believe that the National Railways can
obtain enough business to justify the expenditure of $20,000,000 for a hotel in downtown
Montreal, or to markedly improve the general economy of the road.

SENATE
Some of my supporters may not agree
with me, but even though I may be alone in
saying this, I am going to say it. In my acquaintance with Canadian business I do not
know any of the men who are running the
Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian
National Railways who are not, from every
point of view, first-class businessmen. Among
the Canadian National executives I would
mention Gordon, Dingle and MacMillan. I
may be rather prejudiced in favour of Messrs.
Dingle and MacMillan, because they were
born in Winnipeg. Dingle is the Executive
Vice-President, MacMillan is the head of the
legal department. Both are top-flight executives. Or, to refer to the other road: Mather,
the president, rose from the ranks and came
right through to the top. He knows railroading from A to Z. Crump, a Vice-President, is regarded as a very able businessman.
I make these personal references because
we as Canadians have a tremendous investment in the two railroads. I am not speaking
in terms of money, but from the standpoint
that the success of our country depends
enormously on the fortunes of these two
roads. The western provinces and the Maritimes depend even more than the central
provinces on the efficient operation of the
railroads. They have no other way of getting
their produce to the markets. To me, therefore, as a Canadian and a westerner, it is
reassuring to know that the heads of these
roads are admirably equipped for their jobs.
I have never heard a breath of suspicion
against them.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has told us-and
I do not take issue with him; he may be
right, he may be wrong-that there is resentment among railway workers because
Donald Gordon did not come up through the
ranks. My experience does not confirm that
statement. When the press announcement
was made that Donald Gordon would be made
head of the Canadian National Railways, one
of the ablest young men I know, an employee of the railroad and a great personal
friend of mine-we curl at the same clubcame to me, in the presence of a number of
other members, and said, "Jack, you are a
senator?". I said "Yes, I am." He said
"You belong to this club?". I said, "Yes,
I do." He said, "Tell me candidly, has
Donald Gordon the brains to make the road
a success?" I replied, "In my judgment there
is no better man in Canada for the position."
That is what I felt, and that is what I said.
I do not suppose Gordon even knows of the
existence of this young man, and this was
the first time I had ever commented on his
appointment.

The other day, Frank Hall, union head of
the non-operating trades, expressed himself
in an interview somewhat to this effect: "We
want the money; let the railroads get it
where they can." That attitude is too general
in Canada today. People clamour for pay
increases because, they say, "We need the
money, and Canada has got to give it to
us." In my judgment, if Canada is to be
assured of a sound economic life this type of
thinking will have to be changed. We have
to compete with Germany, with Japan, with
Great Britain, and with other countries whose
workers are not getting the high rates which
are being paid here. Warnings of this sort
may not be well received, but somebody
should tell the Canadian people these things,
and I know of no body which has a greater
responsibility to our people than the Senate.
To my mind there is no position in the gift
of the government which any man or woman
who loves his country can be more proud to
receive than an appointment to the Senate
of Canada. Honour and prestige attach to
our judges, our lieutenant-governors and
other functionaries, but we men and women
of the Senate have been honoured above
all others by our own country, and we owe
it to our people to speak out and, irrespective
of our politics or any other consideration, to
tell our fellow countrymen what we believe
to be the truth.
Having said these things, I intend to vote
to send this bill to committee, but at the
same time I would plead with the promoters
of the bill, the members of the cabinet, and
responsible officials of the Canadian National
Railways to postpone, say for five years, the
building of this hotel. By that time we
shall know what world conditions hold for us.
I believe that would be the wise and sensible
thing to do.
Probably my honourable friend from Hallfax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) expects me
to say something about a condition which
particularly affects his province. It is a
problem of the same order as arose at the
time of the industrial revolution in England,
and it will continue down the centuries. In
more or less degree, every invention, every
new development, throws out of gear some
part of the national economy. That is the
situation we are up against. I appreciate
very keenly the unfortunate position of the
coal industry in the province of Nova Scotia.
But the truth is that we as Canadians cannot
afford to reject any invention which
accelerates the development of the country;
and if the management of the Canadian
National and the Canadian Pacific railways
are convinced that their roads can be
operated more economically with diesel

JUNE 16, 1954
engines than with coal-fired locomotives, I
do not believe we can force them to act to
the contrary. Admittedly a terrible hardship
will result to some people. But in this connection it must be remembered that in the
United States, and to some extent in Canada,
the union organizations have continued to
boost wages until some industries cannot
compete effectively.
This is the inevitable result of increased
charges, and ways must be found to control
costs. I can remember when twenty-five
cars were a sufficient load for a freight train.
As a boy at school, I used to watch these
trains going by. Later, the load was increased
to fifty cars; then, to seventy-five; now it is
commonly one hundred; and as soon as
switches can be constructed of sufficient
length we shall see diesel engines hauling a
hundred and fifty cars, and with no bigger
crew than used to run the twenty-five-car
freight train. These changes are necessary
developments resulting from invention, and
while all of us sympathize with the people
on whose behalf the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) has
spoken, I do not see any way that a halt can
be put to invention or progress, especially
when the new way is proved conclusively to
be the more economical way.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, I again
plead for the postponement for five years of
the building of this Montreal hotel.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Say two years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe two years will be
long enough, but I suggest five years because
I believe it will require that period for Canada to pass through the coming readjustment. I do not want to see a repetition of
the experience through which our people
passed from 1929 to 1935. We may avoid it
if we are alert to recognize the signs of its
possible return, and to profit by the lessons
we learned during the last great depression.
So, honourable senators, let us rise to our
responsibilities, and support the postponement of extensions of the hotel system until
we can see more clearly what the situation
is going to be. I leave this matter to the
good judgment of the men who administer
the affairs of the railroad. But I recall Mr.
Gordon telling us in committee two or three
years ago that, if certain large sums could
be written off, he could operate the railroad
in reasonably good times without having to
come back for more money. I do not
suggest the railroad is coming back for
additional funds now, but events of the last
six months would indicate that it may do so
before long. Many C.N.R. and C.P.R. employees have been laid off recently in my

city of Winnipeg. This is indicative of a
bad situation, and I do not see any hope for
improving it until Canada improves her
world trade, which she seems unable to do
at the present time.
For these reasons I suggest that we think
carefully before authorizing the construction
of this new hotel in Montreal. There is no
doubt that the city of Montreal would like
to have this hotel, but just look at the
financial records of the operation of C.N.R.
hotels or, in fact, of any other hotels. I
recall how in 1934 everybody was exclaiming
how foolish it was for the C.P.R. to build
the Royal York Hotel in Toronto. Well, that
hotel was built at a cost of $15 or $16 million,
but I have been told that it would cost at
least $50 million to construct the same building today. I again suggest that when this
bill is in committee we should advise the
officials of the C.N.R. not to ask for money
to build a hotel in Montreal for at least
another three years.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri:
Honourable
senators, I rise at this time to make a few
remarks in support of the proposal to construct a new hotel in Montreal. Railroad
transportation and hotel operation cannot be
separated, for the latter is a service of the
railroad. The honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has referred to
some personal experiences, and I want to
illustrate an experience I had a short time
ago. A friend of mine in Quebec City, after
making many unsuccessful attempts to get
hotel accommodation in Montreal, called me
and said: "Senator Vaillancourt, you often
stay in Montreal hotels. Would you mind
trying to get me a room in Montreal for
Well, I called five different
tomorrow?"
hotels in that city, but was told that there
was no available accommodation. The result
was that my friend drove to Montreal and
stayed in a motel. After transacting his
business in Montreal he made arrangements
to ship his purchases to Quebec City by truck
transport rather than by railroad. The point
is that when businessmen arrive by train at
large cities like Montreal and Toronto they
want to get good hotel service in the vicinity
of the railway station, so that they can be
ready to do business the first thing next
morning.
Freight transportation is the principal
business of a railroad, but it is important
that the railroads give good service-which
includes hotel accommodation-to businessYou cannot
men and other travellers.
dissociate the hotel service from the transportation service. Businessmen are concerned
about the lack of hotel accommodation in

SENATE
large cities, and one of the results of this
fact is that many are shipping their merchandise by truck rather than by train. If the
railroads are to continue to enjoy prosperity
they will have to give their users the best
possible service.
As the Leader of the Opposition has said,
Mr. Donald Gordon is a most able person.
During the war years I was associated with
him in the activities of the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board, and if he favours the construction of this hotel I know he must feel
that its existence is vital to the successful
operation of the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: I would draw attention to the fact that if the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) speaks
at this time he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
first thing I have to do this afternoon, I am
bound to say, makes me slightly ashamed of
myself.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It must be pretty bad.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course, if I had the
wvide experience and background of my honurable colleague from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) I would suffer from no such
inhibition.
Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The other day a question
was asked as to the total investment in and
the earnings of the Canadian National system
of hotels. I gave the figures as they appeared
in the information supplied me. Then the
honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake
wished to know what the rate of return was
on the investment, and I unintentionally
erred in my reply. The amount I gave as
total earnings was correct, but I was wrong
in stating that the return on the investment
was 31 per cent in 1953 and 3-37 per cent in
1952. Those were the rates of return on
the portion of money that the C.N.R. had
invested in the Vancouver Hotel, and I have
not got the percentage for the whole hotel
system. I therefore make due apologies to
honourable senators.
As to the arguments advanced on this bill,
I am in a comparatively happy position. I
thought my honourable friend from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) answered the arguments
of the honourable senators from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) and New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) in a very satisfactory way;
and the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) pretty well answered the argument
put forward by the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor). I can

understand the last named senator dropping
a tear for the future of coal in Nova Scotia
and I sympathize with him, but in the conduct
of human affairs progress is inevitable. Fifty
years ago no one would have ventured to
predict that within a period of years railway
transportation in the United States, as well
as in Canada would mostly, if not wholly,
operate on fuel other than coal. The price of
coal, however, kept advancing. The United
Mine Workers of America, who were quite
within their rights, insisted on higher and
still higher wages, which in turn increased
the price of coal. That was the most effective
reason for the railways to consider more
efficient and economical methods of power,
and thus the diesel engine was experimented
with and developed to its present point of
efficiency. It is likely that eventually oil will
almost completely displace coal as the motive
power for railway transportation.
You cannot halt the march of progress, and
I do not think my honourable friend from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Isnor) would argue that
we should attempt to retard the progress of
Canada as a whole out of consideration for
the coal mining industry in Nova Scotia.
However, I want to reassure him that I am
sympathetic toward the problems confronting
his native province. The main factor which
compelled the railways to search for a more
economical source of power than coal was
a continually rising cost of operation. Our
railways found by experiment, as the railways
in the United States did, that freight and
passengers could be moved cheaper by diesel
engines than by steam locomotives. In passing, may I say that the Canadian railways
allowed the United States railways to pioneer
in that field. Now, surely we cannot say
to the railways, "You must stay your hand,"
for this consideration or any other consideration. That would be retrogressive instead of
progressive.
May I just say a word or two about the
hotels?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is a touchy subject.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Really, I need add little
to what our colleagues from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) and Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) have already said. The honourable
senator from Kennebec cited an instance that
happened recently, and I was not surprised
at it. Why? Because, as I mentioned the other
day, Montreal, the largest city in Canada, has
only 408 first-class hotel rooms per 100,000
of population, whereas Vancouver, with probably not more than a quarter of Montreal's
population, if you take in the Island of
Montreal, has more than 1,200 rooms per
100,000 people.

would be enough?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Let me plead with my
friends. I sat here and listened as they
argued and never once interrupted.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You were one of the few,
then.
Hon. Mr. Horner: A new hotel is going up
in Vancouver which is to be financed with
government money.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Let me proceed with the
consideration of this particular hotel. It is
true that it will cost a good deal of money.
The only part of the remarks of the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that I did
not agree with was his suggestion for postponement of this expenditure on the ground
that in five year's time conditions may have
changed and the hotel could be built for
less than at present. I would point out to him
that the cost in five years might well be
higher. But surely he would not seriously
advocate that we should suspend expenditures on branch lines, housing or anything
like that because we might be able to do
these things more cheaply five years from
now. I do not think that is a very sound
argument. We cannot stop progress; we must
continue to develop.
I have very little to say in answer to the
criticism offered by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) as to
the management of the railway. It was really
not related to this bill. I dare say that in a
huge railway system like the C.N.R., with
its thousands of employees, one is bound to
hear some criticism of the president, a vicepresident, superintendent or some other
official. It is the right of people to criticize.
Indeed, I recall visiting the west coast when
my friend from New Westminster and I were
members of the House of Commons, and while
in his constituency I heard one or two people

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am sure he will understand my position if I do not accept the
criticism that he gathered from an individual
on a railway train or some place else about
what the officials of the Canadian National
Railways were doing or not doing. After all,
that is not a very sound ground for condemning all the officials of the railway.
On the other hand, I have heard responsible men, who know of conditions in the
Canadian National Railways, tell me that in
the city of Winnipeg the name of Donald
Gordon stands high with the men. There may
be other persons who hold a different view.
Be that as it may, do not let us attach too
much importance to what some employee or
other may say about his superiors. We enjoy
the right to criticize each other, and I hope
we shall always continue to do so, for that
is one of the priteless freedoms we have. At
the same time, let us not lose our perspective
or judgment by giving undue weight to
criticisms of that kind.
This bill will of course be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, and officials of the railway will
be there to supply whatever information is
requested. I hope that all the criticism
brought forward here today will be raised in
committee. For my part, I do not want to
throw away any money any more than anybody else does, but I do believe that the
building of a Canadian National Railway
hotel in Montreal would be a sound and wise
move. I would point out that the railway
has recognized for a long time the need for
a hotel in that city. What position would the
Canadian National be in if it had no hotels
at all, and the Canadian Pacific had hotels
in all the main cities? It is obvious that
under those circumstances much of the business would go to the road that has the hotels.
And why do the railways in the Old Country
have their hotels? Simply because the hotel
is a useful adjunct to the railway. My information is-and my honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will correct
me if I am wrong-that there is very limited
hotel accommodation for large conventions
in the city of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And we live in a day of
conventions.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Why, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Horner: How many years is it
since the C.P.R. built its last hotel in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think the last hotel
venture of the C.P.R. was the Hotel Vancouver, as a joint effort with the C.N.R.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They removed the old
hotel there.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not sure about that,
but they have a hotel there now. At any
rate, the building of a hotel in Montreal is
simply another step in our normal development. I do not believe it will hurt any existing hotel in that city, and it certainly will
provide more accommodation. I have no
doubt, taking one year with another, that
over a period of time it will give a return on
the capital invested in it. In addition it will
substantially benefit the passenger business
on the Canadian National Railways, in the
same way as all the other C.N.R. hotels have
done.

committee on Bill 469.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, to whom was referred the Bill (469
from the House of Commons) intituled: "An Act
to authorize the provision of moneys to meet certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways System during the calendar year 1954,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of
certain securities to be issued by the Canadian
National Railway Company", have in obedience to
the order of reference of June 16, 1954, examined
the said bill and now beg leave to report the same
without any amend-ment.

READING

Hon. Thomas Vien moved the second reading of Bill 101, an Act respecting benefits for
members of the Canadian forces.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
purports to give statutory form and stability
to benefits and allowances granted to Korean
veterans by orders in council under the
authority of the Veterans Benefit Act, 1951,
and amendments thereto.
The various types of benefits granted under
the provisions of the War Veterans Allowance
Act ceased to be available as a result of cutoff dates established by law. They applied
only to veterans who had seen active service
in a theatre of operation or elsewhere, prior
to the cut-off dates, and, obviously, they were
not available at the outbreak of hostilities in
June, 1950. It became therefore necessary
to revive them in favour of the members of
our special forces.
As honourable senators will recall, at the
inception of the Korean hostilities matters
were in a state of flux; nobody would have
dared predict what the future had in store
for us. It was then deemed inadvisable to
extend to all those who enlisted all the benefits of the War Veterans Allowance Act and
correlated acts.
In April, 1951, however, the Veterans Benefit Act was passed-it is Chapter 62 of the
Statutes of 1950-51-granting members of
our special forces certain benefits, whilst
retaining a degree of flexibility. These benefits were not defined by rigid statutory provisions; developments were expected which
probably would alter and certainly would
clarify the situation. This provisional act of
1951 was extended in 1952, and again in
1953. It gave the government power to pass
orders in council granting certain benefits
and allowances as circumstances might warrant and to regulate their modalities and the
procedure. The same practice had been followed in developing veterans legislation during and after World War II.
Fighting ceased in Korea in July 1953. It
is now expedient to meet the needs of the
Korean veterans by legislation, to provide
rehabilitation compensation, allowances for
disability, etc., in the light of present day
conditions and of our accumulated experience.
In 1950 the groups of men enlisting for
service in Korea were organized in what was
called "Special Forces". Most of these men
were recruited from the regular forces and a
great many of them have remained in the
service.
This bill gives statutory form to provisions
made by the Orders in Coucil, under the

SENATE
authority of the Veterans Benefit Act of 1951,
and amendments thereto. It is supplemental
to the War Veterans Allowance Act which, in
1952, was made available to Korean veterans
as will be seen by reference to the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1952, Chapter 340, section
2 (k) (vi) and section 30 (7).
The principle of the eut-off date, followed
in previous legislation has been retained. To
be eligible, a service man must have served
in, or at least must have departed for, a
theatre of war prior to July 27, 1953, the date
of the Cease-Fire order, and the eut-off date
has been fixed at October 31, 1953.
The basic gratuity under this bill is 50 cents
per day for each day of paid service in a
theatre of operations. This is the same as had
been provided for World War II veterans. A
re-establishment credit of 50 cents per day is
made available, as well as a supplemental
gratuity based on seven days' pay for each
period of 183 days of service in a theatre of
operations, or proportionately for a portion
thereof.
It might be interesting to note that, as of
December 31, 1953, gratuities in the amount
of $5,165,396.11 had been paid to members of
the forces who had served in Korea, or to
dependents of those who have died in service.
An amount of $3,283,786.50 has been appropriated for these Re-Establishment-Credits,
which averages $175.67 per man. Up to
December 31, 1953, an amount of $1,267,975.29
of the appropriated fund had been used.
The Veterans Rehabilitation Act is being
made available to Korean veterans, with its
vocational, undergraduate and postgraduate
training allowances. The specified period
can be extended, if the extension is earned
through scholastic achievement.
On December 31, 1953, there were 36
veterans taking vocational training and 45
taking university training; 73 had completed
their vocational training and three their
university training; 42 had withdrawn from
vocational training and 14 from university
training.
Awaiting return allowances, similar to those
granted to World War II veterans, as well
as the provisions of the Pension Act which
have made available to Korean veterans by
order in council, are confirmed in this bill.
As at December 31, 1953, there were 823
disability pensions, representing an annual
liability of $298,639; there were 117 pensions
paid to dependents, entailing an annual
liability of $147,792; or, in all, 940 pensions
with an annual liability of $446,431.
The benefits of the Veterans Land Act and
Veterans Insurance Act are extended to
Korean veterans.

The means taken after World War II to
provide for the re-establishment of veterans
in civil employment have been extended
under similar conditions to Korean veterans.
These provisions have been put in force from
the beginning of hostilities, and employers
throughout Canada have co-operated so well
with the department that not one complaint
of a Korean veteran being unable to be
reinstated in his civil employment has been
brought to the attention of the minister.
The benefits of the Veterans Business and
Professional Loans Act, administered by the
Minister of Finance, and the provisions of the
Civil Service Act and the Public Service
Superannuation Act, and the statutory preference therein provided, are also herein
made available.
The out-of-work allowance will apply to
those who have served for at least 91 days.
This provides a minimum protection of three
months. These allowances are paid to the
Unemployment Insurance fund, and are added
to the unemployment insurance benefits
available under the Unemployment Insurance
Act. As of December 31, 1953, $1,303,254.60
had been paid into the Unemployment Insurance fund by the Department of Veterans
Affairs, on behalf of some 22,000 Korean
veterans-or, to be exact, 21,999.
The war veterans allowance is not covered
by this bill. It was made available in 1952,
by an amendment to the War Veterans Allowance Act, (R.S.C. (1952) c.340.)
It will therefore be seen that this bill
extends to the Korean veterans, as far as
it is deemed possible to do so, the benefits of
the War Service Grants Act, the Veterans
Rehabilitation Act, the Pension Act, the
Veterans' Land Act, the Veterans Insurance
Act, the Reinstatement in Civil Employment
Act, the Civil Service Act, the Veterans'
Business and Professional Loans Act, the
Public Service Superannuation Act, and the
Unemployment Insurance Act. All these laws
had been enacted to assist the veterans of
World Wars I and II. We are now called
upon to assist the veterans who have so
gallantly, and sometimes so heroically, served
in our Canadian Navy, Army and Air Special
Forces in Korea, under the aegis of the
United Nations.

Honourable senators, I commend this bill
to your favourable consideration, and take
pride and pleasure in moving the second
reading.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

DISABLED PERSONS

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Clarence J. Veniot moved the second
reading of Bill 462, an Act to provide for
allowances for disabled persons.
He said: Honourable senators, of the several social welfare measures which have come
before parliament in the past fifteen years,
I think the present bill will be accorded the
warmest reception because of its particularly
humane character. Indeed, there is no group of
persons in Canada who command the sympathy and the interest of the general public to
the same degree as those unfortunate individuals who are totally and permanently
disabled. I venture to say that there is
hardly a member of this hou'se who has
not, at some time or another, come into close
contact with persons of this category and
keenly felt the tragedy which total disability
inflicts upon the stricken individual and his
family. Referring more closely to home, I
might mention the fact that a young person
who for a number of years performed secretarial duties for several members of this
house is now permanently and totally disabled.
Thousands of Canadian homes are daily
witnesses of such suffering and helplessness,
and continue to bear unassisted the heavy
burden of caring for some disabled member
of the family, and most of these families
have been carrying this physical, mental and
financial strain over a period of years,
without the slightest complaint. While we,
the more fortunate and healthy citizens, can
do very little te physically relieve tragedy
of this kind, we can at least by the present
bill contribute te some extent te lighten the
financial burden of caring for permanently
disabled persons.
This bill comes as the answer to many
prayers. Its principle has been advocated
time and again by private members of both
houses of parliament, as well as by all

welfare organizations and service clubs of
the nation, and I feel that there is no need te
advance a single argument to convince us
of the value and the wisdom of, and the
pressing necessity for, such a measure.
The purpose of the bill is to provide a
nation-wide system of disability allowances.
It authorizes a maximum payment of $40 a
month to needy persons of eighteen years
or over who are permanently and totally
disabled. This figure was arrived at by
agreement after a federal-provincial conference on the matter; and the cost of the payments made under the legislation will be
shared equally by the federal and the provincial governments. The bill presupposes
the passing of enabling legislation by the
participating provinces, as well as the negotiating of agreements between the federal
government and each province concerned.
Previous to this year the provinces of Newfoundland, Alberta and Ontario had disability allowance acts, and since this measure
was forecast in the Speech from the Throne
at the beginning of the session five other
provinces-namely, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia-have passed enabling legislation, and Prince Edward Island has signified
its intention to pass enabling legislation at
the earliest opportunity.
When all the provinces have joined in the
carrying-out of this legislation it is estimated
that from 25,000 te 35,000 totally disabled
persons will benefit by it, and the annual
cost will run between twelve and sixteen
million dollars, te be shared, as I have
already said, by the federal and provincial
governments.
In general this bill closely parallels the Old
Age Assistance Act and the Blind Persons
Act, both of which were unanimously adopted
by parliament in 1951, and in both cases the
costs are shared equally by the federal and
provincial governments.
In nine of the
thirteen clauses of the bill the wording is
identical with that of the Old Age Assistance
Act, except that in the reference te disabled
persons the word "allowance" instead of
"assistance" is used. I shall therefore confine this explanation of the bill to'clauses 3,
7, 11 and 13, which contain features different
from the earlier legislation.
Clause 3, which provides for agreements
with the provinces, is the very core of this
enactment.
Section (1) lays down the
principle of federal-provincial co-operation
in this important undertaking. The federal
government will be empowered te enter into
agreements for sharing on a fifty-fifty basis
the cost of disability allowances provided by
provincial governments under their own

SENATE
legislation. This section also fixes the maximum amount of allowances payable at $40
per month. In this respect it is identical with
the federal Old Age Assistance, Old Age
Security and Blind Persons legislation. At
the January federal-provincial conference
there was general agreement on this point.
Subsection (a) of section (2) of clause 3 sets
the age of eligibility for this allowance at
eighteen years. Some provinces favour a less
generous provision; for instance, a minimum
of twenty-one years, which applies to allowances for the blind. Subsection (a) of clause
7 takes account of this age designation and
provides for a province to specify a higher
minimum age if it considers it necessary to
do so.
Subsection (a) (ii) of clause 3 fixes the
residence requirement at ten years. This
also coincides with the requirement in the
Blind Persons Act.
Clause 3, section (2), subsection (b), requires
that applicants be totally and permanently
disabled as prescribed by the regulations.
The definition of "totally and permanently
disabled" is to be left to the regulations,
because such a definition is a highly technical
matter, involving questions of medical
diagnosis and judgment, and is of vital importance to the provinces which collaborated
with the federal authorities in the drafting
of the resolution.
Officials of the Department of National
Health and Welfare have worked out a tentative definition of permanent total disability
in conjunction with representatives of the
Canadian Medical Association and the senior
health and welfare officers of the ten provincial governments. It reads as follows:
An applicant must be permanently disabled in
the sense that his disability cannot be corrected in
the immediate foreseeable future, and he must be
totally disabled in the sense that he cannot carry
out the ordinary activities of daily living and selfcare.

The Ontario Welfare Department employs
the same phraseology in defining disability,
but it further limits the totality of the disability by the addition of six qualifying
words. The second half of the definition
reads as follows:
An applicant is totally disabled in the sense that
he cannot perform the ordinary activities of daily
living . . .

And here are the qualifying words
. . . without the assistance of another person.

The difficulty of framing a suitable and universally acceptable definition of total and
permanent disability may be further exemplified by the fact that in the United States
twelve states have each a different definition
of what constitutes permanent total disability.

If, after a few years of experience, it is
thought possible to do so, consideration might
be given to transferring the definition to the
act instead of leaving it in the regulations.
But in the beginning stages this would not
allow a sufficient degree of flexibility.
Subsections (c) and (d) of section (2)
of clause 3 of the bill exclude persons already
receiving benefits under existing federal or
provincial programs. The basic purpose of
this legislation, of course, is to assist needy
disabled persons not already provided for.
Subsections (e) and (f) of the same section
deal with persons whose maintenance needs
are already being met under provincial and
local arrangements in sanatoria, mental hospitals or other institutions.
Subsection (g) sets the income ceilings.
For a single person the ceiling is $720 a year,
including allowance; for a married person,
$1,200 a year, including allowance; and for
a married person with a blind spouse, $1,320
a year, including allowance. In general, income ceilings represent the majority view of
the provinces.
We come next to clause 7 of the bill, which
parallels provisions of the Old Age Assistance
Act except for paragraph (xi) of subsection
(d), on page 5 of the bill. This paragraph
provides for suspension of allowances where
the receipient refuses to avail himself of
training, rehabilitation, or treatment measures
offered for his benefit. This is in keeping
with the aim of restoring disabled persons
to normal self-supporting status wherever
possible.
Clauses 11 and 13 of the bill are largely
self-explanatory. Clause Il indicates those
things to be covered in the regulations, and
does not differ substantially from the Old Age
Assistance Act and the Blind Persons Act.
Clause 13 simply provides for the act to
come into force by proclamation rather than
on a specific date.
I think I have sufficiently covered the main
features of this new legislation, particularly
where it differs from the Old Age Assistance
Act and the Blind Persons Act. If the bill is
given second reading I will move that it be
referred to committee, where questions can
be asked of the officials of the Department
of Health and Welfare who will be in attendance.
Honourable senators, in conclusion I may
say that the present bill will help to round out
and complete the framework of social welfare provisions which have been built
through federal, provincial, municipal and
voluntary collaboration. We are thus moving
forward, appreciably, towards our goal of
social and economic well-being for all
Canadians.

JUNE 17, 1954
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Could the honourable
gentleman give us some estimate as to the
cost of administering this act?
Hon. Mr. Veniot: I believe I mentioned
that before. It is estimated that the annual
cost will be from $12 million to $16 million.
This cost is to be shared equally by the federal and provincial governments when all
provinces have entered into agreement with
the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I apologize to the honourable gentleman, for I did not hear him
give that information previously. May I
take the liberty of paying a compliment to
our esteemed colleague for the excellent
explanation he has given of this bill.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He has done honour to
the bill, and the bill does honour to him. I
should also like to commend the government
for introducing this piece of legislation. It is
along the line of other legislation we have
passed so frequently in recent years, which
all helps Canada to describe itself as a
Christian nation. I think it is a wonderful
step forward and in line with the kindly
nation that we are becoming.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I would like to add a word to what
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has just said and also
to thank the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot) for his magnificent
speech. Not only as a French-Canadian
senator, but simply as a French-Canadian,
I wish to thank our Prime Minister for
this new act which supplements our
social security legislation. Because of my
experience in social work, with which I have
been associated for more than forty years,
I was most anxious that such a law should
be enacted. In helping these physically
handicapped and underprivileged people by
granting them some income which is the very
lifeblood of existence, we are giving them new
hope. They were formerly a burden to
society, but now we are going to help them.
They realize at last that they will not be
continually in fear of becoming destitute, and
many of them will become useful members
of society instead of being a burden. It seems
to me that this act is a gesture of social rehabilitation. It may be considered as possibly one of the greatest measures the
government bas ever taken, from the humanitarian point of view, as the Minister of
National Health and Welfare so aptly said
the other day. As we all know, he is always
in sympathy with all Canadians, whoever
they may be, but particularly with those who

are in need of help. I might give an example,
in my own town, of underprivileged people
who were a burden to the public, of citizens
who were practically useless. I have known
such people in my own bailiwick who, for
ten or fifteen years were unable to do any
work. People were found to look after them
and today, far from being a drag upon
society, they have become useful members
of the community. They even go and visit
those who need help and encouragement.
This social measure, I repeat, is a godsend,
and I again wish to thank our Prime Minister and his government for having given us
such a socially sound and highly humanitarian law.
(Text):
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I wish to join in the congratulations to my
honourable friend from Gloucester (Hon. Mr.
Veniot) on the very able way in which he
introduced this bill.
I am sure that, regardless of the community
in Canada from which we may come, all of
us know of distressing cases that this measure
will benefit, and I am confident that it will
receive the warm support of the members of
this house.
May I ask the honourable senator from
Gloucester if the regulations respecting persons qualifying for the allowance will be
agreed upon by both the federal and provincial authorities, and, if so, when it is expected
that they will come to an agreement?
Hon. Mr. Veniot: Honourable senators, the
regulations were studied by the several
provinces and the federal government at the
federal-provincial conference which took
place, I think, January of this year, and all
parties agreed that regulations which were
formulated for the Old Age Assistance Act
and for the Blind Persons Act would work
very well for this particular bill. This bill
is identical with the two statutes I have mentioned, each of which received the unanimous
support of both bouses of parliament in 1951.
There should be no difficulty, therefore, in
arriving at uniformity of regulations by all
the provinces.
Honourable senators, I shall be glad to
answer any further questions which any
honourable senator may wish to ask, before
moving that the bill be referred to the Committee on Public Health and Welfare.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 339, an act to amend the
Pension Act.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The purpose of putting in a limit was partially at least to protect
the veteran. As the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) knows, when a veteran

JUNE 17, 1954
who has been receiving a 50 per cent pension
dies his widow gets the full allowance, regardless of whether or not his death occurred as
a result of war disability. It is again proposed to extend the time within which a
veteran may marry by three years, and this
extension will continue to make it impossible
for any one to take advantage, shall I say,
of the generosity of the Canadian veterans
legislation.
Hon. Mr. King: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My colleague from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) was, I believe,
the first minister of pensions and introduced
the first pension bill into parliament.
Hon. Mr. King: No, that is not quite correct. The first pension act came into effect
in 1919; I was appointed Minister of Health
and Soldiers' Re-Establishment in 1926; and
I introduced amending legislation in the session of 1928.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I know my distinguished colleague has had a good deal to
do with veterans' legislation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Now, another provision is with respect to adopted children. At
the present time if a veteran in receipt of
pension adopts a child, he does not receive
an allowance for that child. To make myself
clear I should say that if a pensioner had
adopted a child prior to establishing his
claim for disability pension be would get an
allowance for the child, but he would not
get the allowance if he adopts the child after
his claim for disability pension has been
acknowledged. This bill provides that a pensioner, if he legally adopts the child, can
receive an allowance for that child.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For how many
children?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no limit to
the number that be can adopt. I think there
was some hesitancy about granting allowances to pensioners for adopted children,
because some pensioners might adopt more
children than they could normally support,
and that is the reason why the provision that
is in this bill was not put in the present
act. However, all the provinces exercise careful supervision with respect to adoption, and
no one can adopt a child without going
before a court and receiving a court order.
It is therefore felt that pensioners should be
entitled to an allowance for all adopted
children.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How much will the
allowance be?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not got the
rates before me.

Hon. Mr. Haig: It will be the same as for
any other children?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the allowance
will be the same as a veteran would get for
any other children.
At the present time a veteran whose claim
is admitted is entitled to a retroactive pension for a period of one year, with an additional six months in case of hardship. Added
to that, there is a provision that a veteran
of World War I is entitled to eighteen
months' additional pension if the delay in
proving his claim has not been due to him
in any way but has occurred because of
administrative difficulties. This provision was
put into effect in connection with First
World War veterans because, as honourable
senators recall, the records relating to many
of them were lost or destroyed and it often
was very difficult for those veterans to prove
their claim except after considerable delay.
That situation does not apply to such an extent in connection with World War II veterans,
for the records concerning them were kept
more carefully. However, it is felt that
the provision should remain in the law, and
according to the bill now before the house,
there will be an allowance for one year
retroactive, plus six months in case of hardship, plus eighteen months if there has been
difficulty in finding the records, provided, of
course, that all that time bas elapsed.
Perhaps I should mention one other provision. It is with respect to the right of a
veteran entitled to pension to claim pension
irrespective of sex. At the present time a
male member of the armed forces who misbehaves himself can still receive his pension,
but with respect to women pensioners section 44 subsection (1) of the present act reads
as follows:
The pension of any female pensioner who is
found to be a common prostitute or who openly
lives with any man in the relationship of man and
wife without being married to him shall be suspended, discontinued or cancelied.

That has applied only to women. It will
continue to apply to women who are not
entitled to a service pension, but if a woman
has served in the armed forces and is entitled to a service pension she will now stand
in the same position in all respects as a male
pensioner under this act.
I think, honourable senators, that I have
explained the major provisions of the bill,
and I commend it to the favourable consideration of this house.
Hon. Mr. King: Do I take it, Mr. Leader,
that this bill has been studied by the House
of Commons committee which bas been dealing with this type of legislation for many
years?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In certain sessions the
House of Commons has appointed a Special
Committee on Veterans Aff airs, which has
reviewed veterans legislation. When I was
a member of the House of Commons I served
on that committee. The bill before us was
carefully examined by that committee in the
present session.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
presume this bill will be sent to committee, so
that other questions can be asked. It is a
very important bill, which I think will
meet with the views of most honourable
senators. While I am not taking exception
to it, I am wondering about the wisdom of
the amendment in section 2, regarding
salaries. I think I can say without fear of
successful contradiction that, rightly or
wrongly, many people believe that when they
have a case to take up with the Canadian
Pension Commission they perhaps can obtain
better results from a member who is favourable to the government. There is nothing to
that at all, but nevertheless that feeling prevails; and I say that as one who still receives
quite a few appeals particularly regarding
war veterans' allowances.
Now, with that thought in mind I am
wondering if it is wise for the government
not only to accept the responsibility of
appointing the members of the board, including the chairman, but to take upon itself the
setting of their salaries.
It should be said at this time, I think, that
Canada has one of the finest pension acts in
the world, and a splendid board to administer it. Honourable senators will agree that
General Melville bas administered the law
with fairness, intelligence and justice. In
saying this I speak from experience, and I
will add that the criterion I rely on is the
number of appeals. Away back between 1930
and 1935 I used to receive from the Vancouver
area as many as a thousand appeals a year
for redress. I am not getting nearly as many
now. That, to me, is a clear indication that
the act is working smoothly, and that those
who come before the Pension Commission
are treated with fairness and justice and are
not denied aid if they have any case at all.
I think this also should be said. While I
have no knowledge or information regarding
other hospitals, I hear none but the highest
praise of the treatment given to patients at
the Shaughnessy Hospital at Vancouver.
Great credit is also due to the worthy and
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King). I think it should be said here,
in this chamber, and I am pleased to say it:
he laid the foundation well.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: But I come back to the
misgiving which is in some people's minds
because of the proposal that the governor in
council who appoints the commissioners,
should also fix their salaries. I think that
the decision to put this proposal in the bill
was made rather too hastily, for I do not
see that any objection could be taken, either
in the other place or here, to having the
salaries of these officials fixed by statute.
Personally I am not opposed to the bill,
but I should like to see it go to committee so
that I may ask one or two questions about it
at that time.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, may
I say a word with regard to the administration of pension and other kinds of social
legislation which are of intimate concern to
the people whose interests are being served.
The officials who are entrusted with duties
of this kind should fully understand and be
keenly interested in the problems with which
they have to deal; and for that reason I
believe that the appointment of the commissioners should be in the hands of the government. Those who make these appointments
do so in consultation with officials who
are engaged in administering the law and
are closely associated with the persons who
benefit by it. So I suggest that not only
appointments but salaries should be the
responsibility of the executive-that is the
governor in council.
Canada bas been very fortunate in the
development of its Pension Act. It was liberally conceived, and I believe that the people
in general, and the veterans particularly, will
acknowledge that the provision which has
been made is as generous as that adopted by
any country, and perhaps more generous than
that of most countries.
Some question was raised regarding the
eligibility for pensions of older veterans who
desire to become married and obtain for
their wives certain pension rights. The matter bas arisen from time to time and is a very
difficult one. I know we had to deal with
it away back in 1926, and again in 1930,
when I was in the other place. But
the number of eligibles is very much smaller,
and one may hope that, through the wise
judgment of the commissioners, such cases
will be handled with fairness and justice.
I do not think concessions of this kind are
being overdone if an inducement and incentive are given to the older pensioner to take
to himself a wife at this time.
As regards the adoption of children, one
must remember that orphans and neglected
children must be taken care of in some way,
either at a reformatory or a refuge, or by

JUNE 17, 1954
adoption. In this respect good progress has
been made. Not many years ago the refuges
were filled with young people for whom no
adoption proceedings were available. Today,
as we have already been reminded, excellent laws in the various provinces govern the
adoption of children. In the case of an
old veteran who bas married at a late age
and who, with his wife, would like to adopt
a child, they must satisfy the authorities that
they are capable of giving a child a good
home. That is a consideration in which all
of us are interested, and I think we can
very properly approve that phase of the bill.
Hon. George P. Burchill: Honourable senators, I was very much interested in the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), because I
wanted to hear from one who, as the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) has reminded us, laid so well the
foundation of the Pension Act, what his
reaction is to section 2, which removes from
parliament the right to fix salaries of the
commissioners and transfers this right to
the governor in council. That is a major
change, and I take it that the honourable
senator from Kootenay East is inclined to
approve it. Many of us have had very satisfactory dealings with the Pension Commission, and we endorse everything that has
been said about them by the honourable senator from New Westminster. I believe that
all over Canada their prestige is very high,
and that they have done and are doing a
wonderful job. Then why make this change,
if they are doing so well and, apparently,
satisfying everybody? Is it likely to promote
greater efficiency? In asking this, I am putting
on paper a question which is in the minds of
a great many of our colleagues: is the government on sound ground in making this change?
With all due respect to the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who explained the bill-and those introductory
speeches and explanations we always enjoy
-he has not entirely satisfied me of the
desirability of this change, and I question if
it is desirable.

department mushroomed practically over
night and many difficulties were encountered
in administering pensions. When I was serving as minister of that department, individual
cases were often reviewed on the floor of the
other house. That sort of thing rarely
happens today, for administration procedures
have been ironed out and such cases are
thoroughly investigated by the appropriate
authorities. Individual cases which present
difficulties are referred to local pension
authorities or to the Canadian Pension Commission in Ottawa.
I want to say something about salaries.
The salaries of the chairman, deputy chairman and commissioners are fixed by the
governor in council, while the salaries of the
other employees of the commission come
under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service
Commission. The appointment of the deputy
minister still lies with the governor in council,
who from time to time is advised by the
minister as to the requirements of the officials
administering the act.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: I am puzzled at the
reference that has been made about pension
benefits for children legally adopted by older
veterans. I am under the impression that
throughout Canada the Children's Aid Society
will not sanction the adoption of children by
parents over the age of forty.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If that is so, then
these veterans would not be entitled to
receive such pension allowances. At the
present time, veterans under the age of
thirty who are in receipt of pensions are not
eligible for additional pension allowances if
they adopt children, but this bill will enable
them to enjoy this benefit.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not like to say much about legislation
of this type. I am not a war veteran, and
fortunately those of my family who are do
not come under this act. I do not propose
to discuss additional allowances payable in
the case of adopted children, nor do I intend
to say anything about veterans who marry

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and that was some

There is a dangerous provision in this bill.
I appreciate that veterans are in favour of
it and that it bas been passed by the House
of Commons Special Committee on Veterans
Affairs, but I maintain it will have a dangerous psychological effect. A pensioner of
sixty-five or seventy may marry a young
woman of twenty-one, and when he dies his
widow will be eligible to receive a pension
as long as she lives. Furthermore, up to this
session a veteran's widow was eligible to
receive a pension until such time as she
remarried, and then the pension rights were
completely finished.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But according to legislation we passed only a month ago a widow
pensioner who remarries may, upon the death
of ber second husband, draw benefits from
the pension rights of her first husband. Now,
probably my good friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will say that

always aware that somebody has to pay the
piper, and the piper is piping louder and
louder every year; and we are getting to the
stage that if we have a little less activity
there will be difficulty paying for the tune
that is called for. War veterans have told
me they would prefer it if the commissioners
were paid under authority of parliament
rather than of the government.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but the government
actually fixes the salaries, and the veterans
feel parliament should do it.
Hon. Mr. King: Well, that practice would
have to be extended to ail branches of government service.

Hon. Mr. King: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is in accord with the
principle that the veterans would like to see
followed in this case.
Hon. Mr. King: Parliament confirms their
salaries. You are going around in circles.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall continue my remarks, even if you interrupt me from now

veterans that parliament fix the salaries of
the commissioners; there is no question about
that. I can see no reason at ail for making

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree that there is

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is true.
In conclusion, I can only repeat that by

be passed upon in the estimates presented

INTERNAL ECONOMY
PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF CERTAIN
SERVICES-INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I should like to direct a question to the

honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). This question, which affects
the Senate as a whole, concerns a report

given circulation a short time ago about a
proposal to amalgamate certain services, such
as the post office of the Senate and that of
the House of Commons. I should like to
know what decision, if any, has been arrived
at by our Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts. I should also like
to know whether the Senate itself will be
informed about what is happening before the
committee arrives at its final decision in this

matter. I view with some alarm the possibility that this honourable body might lose
some of its rights to the other house, and I
am entirely opposed to this.
May I also say at this time that I would

like to see the Speaker of the Senate given
wider powers in the handling of affairs

affecting the Senate.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
I think I am in a position to reply to the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), because I was present at
the last meeting of the Internal Economy
committee. The committee had before it
certain recommendations involving expenditures of money, and two other recommendations. On behalf of the chairman of the
committee the honourable senator from
Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) presented
to the house a few days ago the committee's
report dealing with the recommendations
involving expenditures of money, but no report was made with respect to the two other
recommendations, because the business in
connection with them is not yet finished.
They have to do with these questions: first,
the administration of the reading room of the
Senate; and secondly, the possible co-operation of the Senate with the House of Commons in the administration of the two post
offices. To look into these matters the committee appointed a subcommittee composed
of the honourable senator from Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson), the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and myself; and when the subcommittee has made
its investigations and reached its final conclusions it will report to the committee, which
in turn will report to the house at an
appropriate time.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I was a member of the special joint committee
which met to consider this matter, and I
believe I am the only member in the
chamber at the moment; therefore, perhaps
I should say a few words at this stage of the
discussion.
The members of the Senate section of that
committee made no promises or commitments
at all. We agreed to consider the matter and
refer it to the Committee on Internal
Economy, from which it will be reported to
the house. The only step taken was in connection with the question of newspapers and
periodicals, which is being referred to the
Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament. The Senate is well represented on that
committee, and a report will no doubt be
made to the house on that question.
In fairness to all concerned, I should like
to say that the House of Commons representatives who served on the special joint committee, and in particular their Speaker, were
most considerate; they made no suggestions
which would result in the taking away of
anything from the Senate by the House of
Commons. There was simply a discussion
on the basis of mutual co-operation between
the two houses; and I as a member of that
committee must record my feeling that the

JUNE 21, 1954
meeting was most harmonious. The object
of the meeting was to find ways and means
of better utilization of the accommodation in
the parliament buildings. When we pointed
out that we had no spare rooms available, no
demands were made upon us to give up our
present rooms.
I may say that I went to the meeting of the
special committee with some of the anxiety
that I think my honourable friend from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has, but after
the harmonious discussion I came away with
the feeling that it was simply an attempt to
bring about through mutual co-operation a
better distribution of the available accommodation in the parliament buildings. This
whole question will of course have to be
referred back to our Standing Committee on
Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts,
to be reviewed by it and later referred to the
house for full consideration.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
think we should be grateful to the honourable the Speaker of the House of Commons
for having prompted a conference to be held
between subcommittees of the two houses of
parliarnent on this important question of
accommodation in these parliament buildings,
which has been a subject of discussion on so
many occasions in the past twenty-five or
thirty years. In 1917, when I was first elected
to the House of Commons, the parliamentary
sessions were held in the National Museum
building. We entered this building early in
1920, and we immediately discovered that it
was too small. The architect explained at
that time that it was because of lack of space
on Parliament Hill that a larger building
had not been erected. This building, however, offers much better accommodation than
did the old one that was destroyed by fire in
1916.
Later, when I was Deputy Speaker of the
House of Commons, the question of the
adequacy of accommodation for members of
the Senate and members of the House of
Commons was discussed on several occasions.
The Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie
King, then Prime Minister, suggested that, in
due course, the east block should be altered
and fitted up for the accommodation of the
Senate, and that the west block should undergo similar alteration and equipment for the
accommodation of the House of Commons.
I am convinced that we shall never solve our
present pressing problem until we carry out
these suggested changes.
This occasion is as good as any to put ourselves on record, as I am doing now. We
should draw to the attention of the government, as forcibly as we can, the fact that
accommodation in the parliament buildings is
83280-43J

not adequate; that we should keep our parliamentary services near at hand--our committees, our reporters, the Press gallery, our
journals, must necessarily be easily accessible.
The time has come when the east block
should be vacated and altered to accommodate the members and services of the Senate,
and the west block fitted for the accommodation of the members and services of the
House of Commons.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The late Prime Minister
King told me that, in his opinion, living
quarters of the Speakers of both bouses and
of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons could easily be provided in the east
and west blocks, respectively. Each senator
and each member of the House of Commons
should have his own room. Greater facilities
are also needed for our committees branch,
for the press gallery, and for various services.
In Washington, as everybody knows, there
is a Senate building and there is a House
of Representatives building, and both are
linked with the main Capitol building by
underground passages. A similar arrangement could easily be made here. I strongly
urge that this matter should be considered
at the earliest possible convenience of the
government and that steps be taken to give
effect to the foregoing suggestions as soon as
possible.
FORMAL OPENINGS OF PARLIAMENT
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a suggestion at this time,
and I am directing it to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). It affects parliament as a whole,
particularly the Senate, and I am bringing
it up now because I expect the session will
be prorogued this week. My suggestion has
to do with the openings of parliament. I am
one of those who take the viewpoint that
parliament and the country have lost a great
deal through discontinuance of formal openings. I know there are those who say "It
is all very well to put on a show, but.

...

"

Nevertheless, I am advocating that we go
back to the former splendour on these occasions
It is well known that before the days of
the Russian revolution the Czars put on a
great show of gold and glitter. It might have
been thought that when, after the popular
rising, they were deposed, an end would have
been put to those formalities; but from what
I learn, the glittering show which the Russian official representatives present at their
public functions makes even our Cabinet
Ministers in formal attire look almost naked.
I notice that the British parliament has

SENATE
revived the formalities which were interrupted by the last war. By and large, in my
opinion, people like forms and ceremonies;
and I am one of those who would like to
see us adhere to the old practice in this
respect, because there is something good in
many of our ancient traditions.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: At one time this chamber
was the scene of a full-dress opening,
attended by the Supreme Court Justices in
their robes of office, and by the military in
full dress. It was one of the great events
in the life of Ottawa. Even if I am alone
in my views on this matter, I would support
a return to our fine pre-war traditions. I
leave this thought with the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and I hope he will give some consideration ta it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall see that the
suggestion made by the honourable member
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is
brought ta the attention of the government.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the third reading
of Bill 469, an Act ta authorize the provision
of moneys to meet certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National Railways
System during the calendar year 1954, and
ta authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of
certain securities ta be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before this bill is read the third time, I rise
to put on record something which does not
appear in the report of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
But first I should mention that the committee
had before it a first-class witness. Though
all of us may not have agreed with everything he said, we realized that he knew his
job, and he answered fully all the questions
put ta him.
The fact which I wish now ta put on record
is that, as disclosed in committee, the estimated cost of the hotel which we discussed,
and which I opposed, is not $20,000,000 but
$25,000,000. In answer to a question which
I put, Mr. N. J. MacMillan replied that in
his opinion the C.N.R. would easily gain 4
per cent interest on the $25 million. I want
that placed on record for future reference.
If I am wrong in predicting that the hotel,
if and when it is completed and operating,

will not earn anything like 4 per cent, I
will be the first to admit it. On the other
hand, if my forecast is correct, then I will
not have to say "I told you sQ".

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed, on
division.
PUBLIC SERVICE
SUPERANNUATION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. John J. Kinley moved the second
reading of Bill 463, an Act to amend the
Public Service Superannuation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
entitled an Act to amend the Public Service
Superannuation Act, comes to us from the
House of Commons. It was introduced there
by resolution, and after being given second
reading it was referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where it
was considered at great length and expert
witnesses were called ta give evidence. It
is a government bill, and we are told it
received very careful consideration before
the decision was made to introduce it. The
bill involves a compulsory plan, and it is
evident that a plan of this sort must be compulsory in order that low rates may be
available. We are told the proposals were
referred confidentially to the National Joint
Council of the Public Service of Canada.
They made a number of suggestions, most
of which, we are told, have been incorporated
into the bill and they endorse the broad
outlines of the plan as a whole.
The purpose of the bill is to supplement,
or round out, the pension benefits provided
under the Public Service Superannuation
Act and the Defence Services Pension Act,
by adding to thern a contributory scheme for
death benefits, which briefly are as follows:
Death benefits up to a maximum of $5,000
for a spouse or estate of a public servant or
a member of the regular forces. This is in
addition to superannuation or pension benefits. The right to death benefits will continue
in certain circumstances if a public servant
ceases to be employed by Her Majesty, or a
member of the regular forces ceases ta be
such a member.
Section 1 of the bill provides that this
amendment shall be incorporated into and
become a part of the Public Service Superannuation Act, Chapter 47 of the Statutes of
1952-53. Then the bill goes on ta detail the
amendments.
First, there is the basic benefit of the
plan, ta be section 39 of the act. This in the
case of a public service employee will be

JUNE 21, 1954
the employee's annual salary
adjusted
upwards where necessary to make it an even
multiple of $250, with a top limit of $5,000.
In the case of the armed forces the amount
will be an even $3,000 for persons below the
rank of chief petty officer in the navy, and
warrant officer in the army or air force, and
$5,000 for all others. The rate of contribution
by all those covered will be 10 cents a
month for each $250 of benefit, that is 40
cents per month for each thousand dollars of
insurance.
The government's contribution will take
the form of the payment of one-sixth of the
benefits to those who die while in the service.
This will replace the present gratuity of two
months' salary at death, which the government has been paying under section 56 of the
Civil Service Act. If there are civil servants
who are not covered by this scheme, the two
months' gratuity at death will still be available under the same conditions as before.
A similar basis of contribution will apply in
the case of the armed services. The insurance
will be in full force until the contributor has
attained the age of sixty if he is in the service. After he reaches the age of sixty the
basic benefit will be reduced by one-tenth
each year until the privilege expires, except
that the basic benefit shall never be less than
one-sixth of the salary, if he is in the service.
The public servant or member of the armed
forces who has five years service may, upon
leaving the service, elect to continue the
insurance, in which case he would pay an
additional one-sixth.
On the death of a
participant the benefits would be payable as
follows: if he dies leaving a spouse, to the
spouse; if he leaves no spouse, to his estate.
Subject to regulations under section 50 of
the act, the benefit shall be paid in a lump
sum.
There is a provision that the bookkeeping
in the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall be
known as the Public Service Death Benefit
Account, and a similar account would be
kept for the armed forces, known as the
Regular Forces Death Benefit Account.
Upon leaving the service, persons who elect
to continue as participants shall be issued
with a certificate, and the insurance will be
discontinued if the regular contributions are
not paid within thirty days after the due date.
Benefits cannot be assigned, attached, or
given as security, and any such transaction
is void.
Once in every five years an actuarial report,
giving the condition of the fund, shall be made.
The minister must lay before parliament each
year a report of the administration of the act.
The governor in council may make regulations to carry the purposes and conditions of
this part of the act into effect.

Section 56 of the Civil Service Act does not
apply to a participant. Section 51 does not
repeal the Civil Service Insurance Act, but
provides that no new contracts will be written under it and that present contracts will
be carried on.
Lastly, the act shall come into force by
proclamation.
This bill has been somewhat controversial,
and naturally so, because it is something new.
It affects individuals in large numbers and
the universal coverage is objected to by some
members of the civil service. It is said that
the opposition comprises only a small minority. However, the principle of the bill is
well received, and the details can be better
discussed in committee. It is my intention if
the bill gets second reading to move it into
the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
where further information can be obtained.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before the honourable
gentleman sits down, may I ask him a question? Is every participant obliged to take
insurance of $5,000?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If an employee, now 60
years old, has been employed by the government for say, twenty-five years and will be
superannuated at 65, will the policy go on, or
what happens? Again, supposing an employee, age 21, has been in the service for
only two years, and is still in the service at
the age of 30, when he gets married, what
happens? Or if an employee in those circumstances were a young woman, what would
happen to ber insurance when she got
married?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I did not deal with specific cases, because I thought they could be
dealt with in committee. However, I will
attempt to answer my honourable friend.
Section 39 defines "basic benefit" as follows:
(a) "basic benefit" with respect to a participani
means
(i) five thousand dollars, or
(ii) the salary of the participant if it Is a multiple
of two hundred and fifty dollars or the nearest
multiple of two hundred and flfty dollars above the
salary of the participant if it is not a multiple
of two hundred and fifty dollars,
whichever is the lesser anount.

In other words, a participant's basic benefit is approximately his salary, provided it is
not in excess of $5,000.
May I ask the honourable senator to repeat
his second question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: What happens to the
policy when the contributor reaches the age
of 60?

SENATE
and if his service ceases at the end of three
years, be may continue under the plan by
making the necessary payments until he
reaches the age of 60 or 65 years.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If the honourable gentleman will pardon a correction, I think be
will see by section 41 of the bill that a
person must have served for five years
before he can elect to continue under the
plan.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Very well; I will accept
that correction from the honourable senator.
At any rate, the principle is I think stated
very clearly in the remarks that I made.
Honourable senators, that is very briefly
a broad survey of the character of this legislation. Now, who comes under the plan?
Everybody comes under it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What do they pay?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Let us take as an example
a stenographer employed in the public service
whose parents are dead; she is looking forward to the termination of her service with
the government, when she can retire and
draw ber pension; she has no one in particular
to whom she wants to leave $5,000, should
she die within one, two or three years after
the plan becomes effective. But willy-nilly,
whether she desires it or not, she is under
the plan. It applies to everyone in the service.
That feature of the bill is of course the
exercise of compulsion: it compels persons
to do something that they rnay not want to
do and is an interference with what should be
their unquestioned freedom to make their
hoice. Why is this compulsion sought?
ow
Th nonnurable senator gave the explanation
wht-i he said that in order to get a lower
rate you must have full participation. But,
I say, that does not justify the procedure.
As a matter of fact, the government should
not be in this kind of business at all.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If the employees of the
federal government want insurance, it is
available under many different kinds of group
plans from regular insurance companies.
What is needed is the power to resist the
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Every employee in a demands made by some civil servants that
crown corporation, unless for some reason the government must do something for them
or other the government decides to exclude by way of group insurance, which they
that corporation, is brought into the net; should do for themselves.
and all members of the armed forces are
I believe that on the whole we have a
brought in. But that is not the total score. very good civil service. I have no hesitation
If a civil servant leaves the service he may in saying that the service is too large, but
elect to continue under the benefits of this on the whole it is capable. It is equally true
plan by paying the required premium. The to say that parliament, which represents the
same is true with respect to members of people, has on the whole dealt justly and
the armed forces: A soldier who enlists for fairly with civil servants in the matter of
three years is automatically brought under remuneration, working hours per week, holithe schemo, which is in effect term insurance, days and pensions upon retirement.

Hon. Mr. Kinley: When be reaches 60
years of age it is reduced by one-tenth each
year.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What is reduced by
one-tenth?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: His basic benefit is
reduced by one-tenth, and of course be pays
according to his basic benefit. I read the
evidence that was given before the House
of Commons committee, and I think there
is good reason for that provision. The
participant's superannuation benefits have
grown by that time. A person is usually
not considered a risk for insurance purposes
at 60, and the decline in benefits under this
act is cushioned over a period of ten years.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If a contributor retires
at 60, and dies at 70, be gets nothing at all?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If be remains in the service after 70, and dies while in the service, bis
basic benefit will not go below one-sixth of
his annual salary, for two months' salary
will be paid to his widow or other dependent,
under a provision in the Civil Service Act.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I suggest that some features of this bill
should be very closely examined. I confess
at once that I am opposed to the compulsory
principle of the proposed legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be permitted to
interrupt the honourable gentleman? I wonder if in his remarks he would give us
some illustrations of the effect of the provisions of the bill. I have read them, but
I fail to understand what they do.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes; in my perhaps
somewhat clumsy fashion I intend to come
to that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The honourable senator
who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
gave an explanation of its provisions and,
as I understand them, everyone in the civil
service is brought into the net.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Right.

JUNE 21, 1954
Hon. Mr. Reid: And sick leave.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not think anyone
can dispute that we have been, if not overly
generous, at least very fair with the civil
service. This bill would take us one step
farther, and its compulsory feature is one
that I frankly cannot support.
In my judgment there is one other objectionable feature of the measure. What guarantee can the honourable. senator who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr. Kinley), or anybody
else, give us that this scheme is actuarially
sound? No one can give us such a guarantee.
I would like to have a report from some
independent actuaries as to whether this
scheme is or is not actuarially sound. In
this respect may I remind the house that
we have had adventures similar to this one
in the past. Away back many years ago-if
my memory serves me rightly about fifty
years more or less-there was introduced a
scheme by which people could buy government annuities from the Department of
Labour or through the post offices by paying
certain sums of money supposed to cover the
cost. Today any person who wants to buy
an annuity has the choice of a dozen or
more life insurance companies which will be
glad to serve him; but that was not the
case when the annuities scheme was first
entered into, and for that reason I am bound
to say I thought it was a reasonable provision
at that time.
Now, the annuities scheme was supposed
to be actuarily sound. It has not been. The
government from time to time has had to
contribute millions and millions of dollars
to keep the annuity fund solvent, so that
payments could be made on demand to those
who held contracts for the payment of
annuities. That is one illustration.
May I give another illustration: the civil
service superannuation fund. That fund was
clearly based on a sound principle: that the
employee would make his contribution, and
the government would make a contribution
and administer the fund. It was supposed to
be placed on a sound actuarial basis and on
the basis of the actuarial tables it was
calculated what contributions were necessary
in order to keep the fund solvent. Well,
honourable senators will recollect that for
the last several years we have been making
huge payments to the superannuation fund
to put it in a solvent condition.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Because of a paper deficit.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is another illustration of where the calculations went wrong.
I have only one other instance to mention,
a more recent one, the Old Age Security fund.
When Old Age Security payments were inaugurated, several years ago, there was

devised a formula under which certain taxes
would be earmarked for the fund. That was
known as the 2-2-2 formula: 2 per cent to be
contributed to the fund from corporation
taxes, 2 per cent from sales taxes, and 2 per
cent from personal income taxes, and it was
said that the revenue derived under this
formula would, after a few months' experience, support the fund. Has it done so? The
Old Age Security fund is in the redHon. Mr. Kinley: Aren't you glad that it
is? It indicates that people are living longer.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and indebted to the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada to
the extent of some $200 million today, and
this the taxpayers will have to provide.
Now, all I am pleading for is that the
scheme presented to us in this bill should
be very closely examined. We should give
an opportunity to civil servants who do not
want to contribute to the fund to appear before us and state their reasons. I am informed that the Civil Service as a whole was
not consulted in connection with this proposal.
If my information is correct, some leaders
of the Civil Service were consulted but they
were not permitted to discuss the matter with
their membership at large; and if my information is not correct, of course I very much
regret having mentioned it. At any rate,
there is apparently in the Civil Service substantial opposition to this measure. I do not
think that parliament should compel people
against their wishes to come into an arrangement of this kind.
And, as I have said, I do think this proposal
should be very closely scrutinized by independent actuaries. Every man or woman
who puts on a uniform, whether of the air
force, the navy or the army, will come under
this fund. God forbid that we should become
involved in another war, but that possibility
exists, else we would not be making all the
preparation we are making today. If we do,
and heavy casualties should result, we shall
have automatically insured every one of
them under this plan. Now, all I am suggesting to my colleagues here today is that
this is one of the really important bills from
a monetary point of view that have come
before the Senate this session, and I do think
it should have the closest consideration when
it is before a committee. We should know
where we are travelling. We should not be
satisfied to have the committee meet and
report the bill back to the Senate without an
opportunity having been given to opponents
of the bill to appear and state their views.
Honourable senators, that is all the contribution I wish to make to this discussion,
but I do feel that I would be remiss in my

SENATE
duty as a member of the Senate if I did not
point out these considerations, which to me
appear to be very important.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, in substance the bill before us provides for the establishment of a scheme of
insurance or death benefits for members of
the Civil Service and of the armed forces.
I am sure we all approve of the broad principle of insurance, and we appreciate that protection afforded through participation in
group insurance schemes is a very good thing.
The basic idea of providing insurance for
those who need it is very sound, and I do not
think there can be any doubt of the wisdom
of individuals who are carrying heavy
responsibilities lessening their own risks by
joining in a scheme of insurance with others
who are in a similar situation.
Usually, in connection with group insurance, the responsibility of the state is ordinarily just to enable the parties through legislation to join together in a common scheme.
The government usually proposes that there
be included in the legislation safeguards
against fraud and imprudent business practices that might come into the scheme. But
in this instance the state is the employer,
and it is taking the initiative in introducing
the scheme. Whenever an employer initiates
a scheme of this sort, he is open to the charge
of unfairness on the part of some participants, of course. But no matter how meritorious the employer may consider the planand I have no doubt that the government,
when introducing this plan, considered that
it had great merits; and I, too, believe in the
merits of group insurance-but no matter
how meritorious it may seem to the employer,
he must give careful thought to any reasonable objections that are made by his employees, even if they are made by only a minority. And I think the employer should not
only give careful thought to the questions of
justice and fairness, but he should also take
into consideration the matter of harmony
within his own organization.
Now, honourable senators, from the number of dissatisfied civil servants who have
approached me personally to complain about
this bill since it was introduced into the
House of Commons on May 25, 1954, and
from their strong opposition to it, I feel that
I must bring to the attention of the honourable members of this house and to the attention of the government that the bill is certainly creating disharmony within the Civil
Service.
Then, too, when an employer introduces a
scheme such as this, and particularly if it
!s one to which the employees themselves

are to make the larger bulk of the contributions, thorough consultation is had with the
individuals concerned to know whether they
are willing to participate. The honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has
already mentioned that in this instance no
such thorough consultation has taken place,
so I will not labour the point, but it seems
to me that if civil servants had had the same
opportunity as members of the armed forces
have had to learn the contents of the bill, the
government would have discovered that very
strong opposition could be expected.
Most of those who have approached me
in this connection are single women
employees, but I am told that a large number of men employees, single and married,
object to the compulsory feature, both
because it will work a hardship on their
women fellow-employees, and because many
of the men concerned have already made
ample provision for the cost of illness and
the expenses incurred in case of death.
They feel that this insurance, which, if the
bill is passed, they will be compelled to take,
will be an addition to what they already
have, because it does not in any way replace
the provisions for security for which they
have already subscribed. If they now have
medical health insurance, they must continue it, for under this bill they will not be
entitled to recover the costs of illness unless
the illness results in death. If they have
some plan to defray the expenses of their
funerals, they must nevertheless retain that
protection because, unless death occurs
before seventy years, the costs involved do
not become a charge against the benefits
provided by the bill.
I was approached on this matter very
soon after the bill was introduced, and I
felt that, as a woman, it was my duty to
give it all the attention I could. I attended
the meetings of the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the other place, and I also
read in the press, as no doubt other honourable senators have done, the reports of
comments made in that committee. As a
citizen of a country which has subscribed
to the declaration of human rights, under
which discrimination on the grounds of race,
colour, creed and sex was recommended to
be abolished, I very much resent the slighting references which were made to unmarried women employees in connection with
the opposition to this bill. Perhaps such
remarks are inevitable. But I venture to
say that many women employees who
remain unmarried do so from choice; many
others are unmarried because the men
whom they might have married were killed
in the first or the second world war. That

JUNE 21, 1954
fact, instead of giving rise to amusement,
should have awakened a protective feeling
of chilvalry towards them.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Al these people are
human beings. Most of the women civil
servants I know work hard, and from my
own experience I would say that many of
them work harder than the members of the
opposite sex who hold similar positions,
because we women who have been in professions and in business know it is one of
the facts of life that if we are to be considered as good as a man we actually have
to be at least twice as goodHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: -and we have to
work at least twice as hard. Women are
employees, as men are employees, and surely
the marital status of either is not a subject
for jocular comment.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators
will recall that I requested from the government figures showing how many women were
employed in the Civil Service as of October
31, 1953, and also how many of those women
were single. The reply given by the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) on June 10 was that there are
30,389 women in the Civil Service, and there
was a breakdown as to those who are temporary and those who are permanent. I
might mention that both temporary and permanent employees come under the Public
Service Superannuation Act, and are therefore covered by the present bill. I was told
that there are no figures showing how many
women employees are married and how many
are single. Realizing that I had not worded
my question clearly, I asked for information
as to how many of these women had single
status. I understand that when any person
desiring to become a member of the Civil
Service is required to state on the application
form whether he or she has single status,
but it appears that up-to-date information on
this question is not obtainable. However, in
view of the provisions of section 36 of the
Civil Service Regulations, which states that
"no married woman whose husband is living
shall be eligible for appointment to the Civil
Service", I believe I am justified in supposing
that the large majority of these 30,389
employees have single status. It is true that
section 36 provides for some exceptions, but
I have reason to believe that married women
employed in the Civil Service under these
exceptions are very greatly in the minority.
83280-44

In this connection I would like to state
that this also is one of the regulations of the
Civil Service to which I strongly object. An
applicant for a position in the Civil Service
should receive the appointment on the
strength of his or her qualifications and not
on marital status. I do not see why a highly
qualified woman should be refused an
appointment in favour of a man whose qualifications are less. For one thing, it is not a
very economical way in which to carry on
the nation's business.
Figures have been given in committee to
the effect that there are 120,000 Civil Service
employees. It would appear then that about
one-quarter, or 25 per cent, of those
employees are women, and that most of these
are of unmarried status. One-fourth certainly
does not represent the small minority which
the honourable gentleman from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) referred to.
In my opinion it is a rather large minority,
certainly large enough that their complaints
deserve serious consideration, and the legislation to which they object should receive
very serious reconsideration or amendment.
Honourable senators, one of the arguments
presented to me by single women employees
is that they have already made provision for
their own last illness and burial and that
they do not have dependents to whom they
wish to leave an estate. I know that I am
repeating somewhat, but I want to recount
their arguments. I am not just generalizing,
for I have inquired from a number of women
employees as to just what protection they
have. They gave me facts and figures which
certainly convinced me that, through participation in a medical health plan or some
similar scheme, they have adequately provided for their last illness and death. I am
sure it will be admitted that women are
generally more provident than men in matters of this kind, and so I believe them when
they claim they have made such provision.
These women feel that if this bill becomes
law they will need to continue providing for
medical services, hospitalization and burial,
for the death benefit under this bill will not
cover them in case of illness from which
they recover, nor will it take care of their
funeral expenses should they die after the
age of seventy. On the other hand, their
present type of coverage is sufficient to take
care of the cost of illness from which they
recover and expenses incurred as a result
of death at any age.
It is a well-known fact that women live
longer than men, and I secured information
from the Bureau of Statistics disclosing that
the normal span of a woman's life is three

SENATE
to four years longer than that of a man. A
week ago today I heard a radio report of a
speech made at the annual meeting of the
Canadian Medical Association held in Vancouver, in which it was stated that death
before seventy is now considered premature.
It is not surprising therefore that women
employees in the civil service feel this legislation is weighted heavily against them
because the benefit vanishes at the age of
seventy.
I have also been told by many of these
women that they have no interest in increasing the amount they might leave in their
estates. Early in their lives many of these
women were burdened with financial responsibility on behalf of their parents or younger
brothers or sisters. I am sure honourable
members will agree that spinster members
of families have assumed this responsibility
since time immemorial, and this is another
reason why some of them have never been
able to marry. Nevertheless, they have willingly assumed this responsibility, and I do
not think they should be prejudiced for
having done so. As these employees grow
older their parents die; and their younger
brothers and sisters, upon becoming independent, do not wish to see their spinster
sisters, who have already sacrificed so much
for them, continue to be deprived of even
small amounts of money in order to provide
further for them by leaving estates; they
feel they have already received enough in
the way of money and care from these older
sisters. To compel a single employee, or
indeed any employee, to contribute to a plan
which would create an estate to be distributed-as it has been suggested-to
charity, seems to me to be unreasonable and
far-fetched, even though it may appear to
be a Christian ideal. I think at the very least
an employee should be able to decide for
himself whether he wishes to leave such an
estate.
I was also told by the women who
approached me that although this legislation
is intended to be a rounding out of the
Public Service Superannuation plan, they
feel it is based on a different principle. Here
is why. Under the Superannuation Act the
employee participant or his estate always
gets back the money which has been contributed, either at the time he leaves the
Civil Service or upon his death, or by way
of superannuation payments upon his retirement. Under the proposed scheme, unless the
participant dies before the age of seventy he
will get back nothing whatever from what
he bas contributed. If death before the age
of seventy is considered to be premature,
and if it is true that the normal life span of
a woman is longer than that of a man, then

there seems to be reasonable ground for dissatisfaction among women employees in the
civil service.
It has been stated that an optional scheme
or one which excluded single women would
be more costly, but the women with whom I
have talked have pointed out that the cost
of such a plan would be borne by those who
want the protection and who might conceivably receive some benefit from it. It has
also been stated that the cost of an optional
scheme would be prohibitive. However, some
of my women informants have pointed out
that deductions are now made from their
salary cheques for the Public Service hospital-medical insurance plan, which operates
on an optional basis; and I also understand
that deductions are made from pay cheques
for contributions to the Blue Cross Plan. I
believe that a staff in the Department of
Finance looks after these deductions, and
from this year's estimates it would appear
that the cost of this administration is not
great. Those who brought this to my attention cannot see why this staff, with some
additional members, or another similar
administrative staff, could not, with little
additional expense to the government, make
the salary deductions for a death benefit
plan placed on an optional footing.
The women employees in the Civil Service
do not have an organization of their own;
therefore they are unable to speak with one
voice on this subject. However, their recent
experience with this bill has made them
realize the value of such an organization, and
I would not be surprised to see one come to
life very shortly. Because of this lack of
a united voice, and because the women
employees of the Civil Service in the city of
Ottawa wanted to have some figures to show
that their objection to the compulsory feature
of this bill was shared by a large number of
them, they circulated a questionnaire. The
results show that of 1,700 who received the
questionnaire 90 per cent registered strong
objection to the compulsory feature; and 69
per cent want women left out of the scheme
entirely-which does not mean that the remaining 31 per cent wanted women included,
for many of their answers were so qualified
that they could not be listed as "Yes" or
"No."
I might add that I visited my home province
of New Brunswick within the past two weeks,
and as I know many civil servants there I
asked some of them what they thought about
the death benefits proposed by the bill before
us. I was told that there was strong objection to the compulsory feature, not only on
the part of the women, but also on the part of
the men, and that all were uneasy at this
arbitrary decision of the employer.

JUNE 21, 1954
Honourable senators may be interested in
a report, dated June 15 last, which appeared
in the Journal of Commerce of New York.
It shows that the Senate of our great neighbour to the south is at present considering a
bill to provide group insurance for federal
employees, and a Senate committee is conducting exhaustive hearings in that country.
The group insurance contemplated by that
bill will be on a voluntary basis.
In view of the representations which have
been made to me, honourable senators, I feel
that this proposed legislation should receive
very serious study by this house. I repeat
that I believe in the general principle of group
insurance, but in my opinion the bill has some
very objectionable features. It seems to me
that this is an occasion when the Senate
should exercise that "sober second thought",
which according to the great statesman Sir
John A. Macdonald, who later became Canada's first Prime Minister, is one of the chief
functions of the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) has put the case so
well that I feel there is nothing left for
me to add, except to say that I strongly support everything she has said. I think I have
had an even higher proportion of women civil
servants express their disapproval. In one
department at Ottawa 82 out of 85 objected,
and in another department I think the
proportion was larger than that. I join with
the honourable senator in saying that this
bill should receive the most careful consideration, and that civil servants, both male
and female, should be given an opportunity
to express their opinions.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, so
far one question in regard to this bill has
not be answered satisfactorily, to my mind.
Why the haste in dealing with the bill when
we are so near the end of the session? That
question was asked in the other house also.
Let us examine what has taken place in
regard to this proposed legislation, compared
with other government bills. Take the pension Bill, for instance: every opportunity was
given to the representatives of the Canadian
Legion and other interested bodies to appear
before the committee to which the bills was
referred by the other house. Similarly, representatives of the banks had full opportunities
to express their views on the Bank Bill. And
so it goes. But in this instance the government seems to have changed its policy. I
can well understand why the C.C.F. party is
supporting this legislation. Indeed, it looks
to me as if the government has swallowed up
the C.C.F., because that party has nothing
83280-44i

more to advocate by way of social legislation
than the nationalization of health services.
The great Liberal party, the party that believed so strongly in free enterprise, has at
last gone down the road of social welfare,
and bit by bit we have lost our liberties and
exchanged our heritage for a mess of pottage.
I say without fear of successful contradiction,
as one who has always been a fighter for
the privileges of the people and as a real
Liberal, that I view with alarm the apathy
with which the people of Canada have since
the last war allowed municipal, provincial
and federal governments to encroach bit by
bit on their liberties.
Before I forget, I should like to deal with
one matter mentioned by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
that of superannuation. Honourable senators
will recall that the subject was before the
house last year.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You mean annuities?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I refer to both annuities and
superannuation, but particularly superannuation. I never did get an answer to my query
as to why the country on the advice of actuaries, put up millions of dollars to support
the superannuation fund. I placed some figures on the record last session, and I shall
place a few more on it today, to show that
the payments made into the superannuation
fund have almost met the expenses of the
fund.

In 1953 the fund disbursed $15,352,000, and

it received as contributions from civil servants $13,927,000,
leaving a deficit of
$1,425,000. How the actuaries could say that
some $180 million was required to make
up the deficit, is something I have never yet
had explained to me. Perhaps the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) did not hear the interjection I made
while he was speaking, to the effect that it
was just a paper deficit and not an actual
deficit.
Civil servants are not like factory workers
who come under the unemployment insurance
scheme and who, when there is a depression,
may be laid off by the thousands; on the
contrary, when one joins the civil service it
is a generally accepted fact that he is there
for life, for the tendency is to increase rather
than decrease the number of employees.
I should like to know the exact number of
single women in the public service. My
advice to the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who made
an inquiry earlier in the session on this
subject, is that she should phrase her questions very carefully with a view to what she
hopes to find out. My experience is that the

SENATE
authorities look over these questions, and
sometimes answer them within very narrow
bounds.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should like to
inform the member for New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) that it was impossible to get
the information that the honourable lady
from New Brunswick requested. The information is not a matter of record, and I think
she is satisfied that it is not available.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope we get the information as to the number of unmarried women
in the service when this bill is before committee. As the honourable lady pointed out,
when a woman joins the service she has to
give her domestic status, and all that information is recorded and tabulated.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am informed the
information is not tabulated.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
I am aware that the information is not tabulated. However, I do believe that it is contained in the files of the Civil Service
Commission. I know from my own experience
that every year, when civil servants make
their income tax returns, they must state
whether their marital status has changed
within the past year. While I think that
information would be available in individual
files, I realize it is not in tabulated form in
which the honourable Leader of the Government could supply it to me.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I take it that the great
proportion of females working in Ottawa are
unmarried. Indeed, it has been said that
women who come to Ottawa to work in the
public service deny themselves the opportunity of matrimony; for most of them it is
a life of celibacy. Those women who have
spoken to me are all single; and they protest
against this measure because they have had
no opportunity to express themselves on it
and it offers no direct benefits to them.
Under normal circumstances, when one
takes exception to a bill that comes before
parliament he may in the end have to bow
to it because it represents the voice of the
majority, but he at least is given an opportunity to express his viewpoint along with
other interested persons. In this case, however, the government went secretly to one
branch of the public service about the bill,
and it went to the army in the same way.
That is surely unnrecedented procedure;
never in my time in parliament has the government discussed a bill it was going to
introduce-not even in a government caucus.
I repeat, why all the haste in this
instance? It is my opinion that this bill was
conceived by some of the higher officials in

the government. Indeed, I personally doubt
very much if the bill was thought up by any
cabinet minister. If it is the product of a
minister, I should like to know who he is.
Having been, as I believe, conceived by some
high officials, it was brought forward and is
now being rushed through parliament in the
dying days of the session.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The Minister of Finance
moved the second reading of the bill in the
other house.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know he moved the
second reading, but that is not what I said.
My question was, who "thought up" the
scheme of giving death benefits under a
compulsory plan? I know, of course, that
the minister introduced the bill and had to
take responsibility for it, and said he wanted
to get it through this session.
I intend to reserve the rest of my remarks
until the bill goes to committee. But I say
now that if the bill is as good as some say
it is-and I am sure it has some favourable
features-what have we got to fear by allowing representatives of the Civil Service
group to come forward and argue their case?
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
t
perhaps there is very li tle need for me to add
anything further to the discussion on this bill,
as the honourable senator for New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) spoke on the
particular point that I intended to specifically
object to. The second reading stage is when
one should declare oneself on the principle of
a bill, and if the bill is given the second
reading and sent to committee, it is too late
to do much on the third reading. However,
I rise particularly to congratulate the bonourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson)Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: -upon her very able
speech in defence of wornen civil servants.
I may say that T think the people of New
Brunswick are indeed fortunate in having a
lawyer of her ability te reuresent them here.
I imagine she would be very efficient when
pleading a case in court.
I happen to know personally some women
civil servants who are in the category that
the honourable senator mentioned, who in
early life perhaps might have married, but
they had to support a mother and younger
brothers and sisters. Now they are in a posilion where this death benefit will be of no
lse to then whatever, for they have made
their own insurance arrangements.
Particularly, however, I want to say that
the compulsory feature of this bill smacks
of socialism. Every year, in the past several

JUNE 21, 1954
years, there have been laws passed which
are nothing less than a further dose of what
we are told is good for us, but which nevertheless further deprives every individual of
the freedom to choose, ta select, whatever he
may need-in this case, insurance. That is,
of course, a bill that socialists agree with,
for it contains a large dose of socialism. I
certainly object ta the bill, on that principle
mainly.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
in view of the remarks of the honourable
senators who have preceded me, I am not at
all certain that I would be disposed ta have
my vote for second reading considered as
meaning that I support every detail of this
bill, because I think a very strong case has
been made out by some who have spoken
this afternoon for a very extensive examination in committee before this bill is reported
back to the house.
I am not altogether opposed to the principle
of compulsory insurance in the Civil Service,
assuming that it can be worked out on a
basis that is fair ta all or ta the very large
proportion of the people concerned. But I
must say that the observations of the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) have led me ta think that that
may not be sa in the present case.
There was one point that occurred ta me
about this bill, which I have read only very
casually during the course of the debate. I
should like ta ask the honourable senator
who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr. Kinley) if
these contributions by the participants, as
set out in section 42, namely, ten cents per
month for every $250 of salary, are going ta
meet substantially the whole cost of this
scheme, because I cannot find any provision
for contributions by the government. What
proportion of the total cost is ta be paid by
the individuals themselves?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I may say that I have
had no information as ta that, beyond the
evidence taken before the committee of
the House of Commons, and the announcement made in that house that it was not
expected the bill would be an extra burden
on the treasury.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Then we can assume
that this ten cents per month per $250 of
salary which the participants are expected
ta contribute will substantially pay for the
cost of the whole scheme?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Under the regulations
the government pays two months' salary
after death.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, I realize that.

Hon. Mr. Kinley: And the government
bears the cost of administration, too.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is pretty small.
Apparently the participants are ta bear
practically the whole of the expense of this
scheme, yet section 44 provides:
44 (1) Benefits shall be paid as follows:
(a) if the participant died leaving a spouse, to
the spouse; . . .
And I notice in section 50 that:
The governor in council may make regulations
. . . prescribing the circunstances in which a
deceased female participant who, in the opinion of
the Treasury BoardThis is lovely-was at the time of her death living apart from
her husband by reason of his desertion, shal, for
the purpose of this part, be deemed to have died
leaving no spouse:
Well, it seems ta me that this is paternalism gone mad. If these people are paying
for their insurance, surely they and they
alone should say ta whom the insurance
should go at their death, and all this nonsense of the benefits going ta the spouse in
certain cases and going ta the estate in
other cases should be taken out of the bill.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Might I answer the
honourable senator by saying that that
provision was not in the original bill. As
I remember, one of the organizations
objected ta the wording that the benefits
would go ta a spouse who had not been living with the civil servant who died, and
that provision was inserted because it was
thought ta be more acceptable. If the money
did not go ta the spouse it would go ta the
estate of the deceased.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, if these people
are paying almost entirely for their own
insurance, neither the Treasury Board nor
anybody else should have any say as ta
where the benefits of it are going.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend ta speak ta any extent on
the bill, but I do want to congratulate the
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) and ta say that she made
a splendid speech on this question here this
afternoon.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the women of Canada needed any proof that women are
useful in the Senate of Canada, they have
certainly got it now.
I listened with
pleasure ta the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and ta the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), but nobody has given me yet any
figures as ta what the bill does or any illustrations of what it might do. I do nat know
how many members of this house are

SENATE

enrolled under a group insurance plan, but
I am. A firm that I was associated with
many years ago entered into a group insurance contract on behalf of its employees.
It was not a compulsory scheme. In that
office there were ten lawyers, about twenty
stenographers and some other help, and in
order to make the contract effective I think
at least seven lawyers and a certain number of stenographers had to participate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose the larger
the number in it the less the individual
premium would be.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, the premium was the
same no matter how many were in it. The
policy for a partner was $5,000; for a lawyer,
who was not a partner, $3,000; and for other
staff members, $2,000. If anyone left the
employment of the firm he could take over
the policy himself. No physical examination
was required, and there was no age limit.
That was the first experience that I had with
group insurance.
I had another experience when I was with
a smaller firm, and the contract with the
insurance company specified that there had
to be at least seven people in the scheme.
Two or three members of the staff refused
to join, and there was no compulsion resorted
to. The terms were these: the partners paid
a premium, the amount of which I forget,
and each member of the staff paid half of his
respective premium, the firm paying the other
half-I think the premium was $2 a month,
so a stenographer paid $1 and the firm paid
$1. The only trouble with that group insurance plan was that the insurance company
allowed too many people over seventy to
join it, and the premiums were not high
enough to cover the obligations. The result
was that difficulty arose, and finally the plan
was dropped. But nobody was compelled
to take part in a scheme of that kind. If a
firm consisted of, say, three or four partners,
with seven to ten employees, unless a minimum number consented to participate the
firm could not be included. The employees
could go in or stay out, as they wished.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Except new employees.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. New employees, as a
condition of their employment, could be compelled to join in the scheme, but any who
were employed when it was instituted could
not be forced to participate against their
will. In the firm in which I was a partner
and office manager, I canvassed everyone
in the place except the partners with a view
to getting them to participate. But, as the
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) bas said, there are many
employees whose fathers and mothers are
dead, who have no home ties of any kind,

and no one to support but themselves, and
for them such a plan has no appeal. In our
case, they said, "We are covered for hospitalization and medical expenses by the Blue
Cross, to which we subscribe, and we do not
need these other benefits." I told them, "It is
up to you." There were no threats or hints
of compulsion, no suggestion that refusal
would mean loss of employment: in fact,
some of the girls who would not take part
are still working in the office.
The point has also been made, and it seems
to me important, that no reason has been
given for the introduction of this legislation.
This is a matter which gives me some concern. Honourable senators who are lawyers
know how frequently it happens that, when
the bread-winner dies, the widow is left with
no more than $1,500 or $2,000 in cash, and
to me it is deplorable-perhaps I should not
say so-that so large a part of the money
goes for funeral expenses. I have known all
too many cases where, as a result, very little
is left for the family to live on. My understanding is that this bill was suggested by
some of the older Civil Service employees,
because of their experience that from time to
time civil servants die without leaving any
cash reserve, and contributions are called for
to provide money for burial expenses.
I do not think a measure of this kind
should be passed in a hurry: it should be
looked into very carefully. I am impressed
with the figures quoted by the honourable
member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). As
everyone knows, of late years the value of
money has fallen, and with it, the real value
of pensions. But the present situation with
respect to the civil service superannuation
fund cannot fairly be blamed on those who
initiated the plan. Since 1904 the average
span of human life has been extended nearly
twenty years. Recently we were addressed on
this matter by medical men. Annuitants live
longer, and this has a marked effect upon
the soundness of earlier schemes. It is therefore all the more important in this case that
we should have exact actuarial information.
I suggest that a young clerk in the Civil
Service who is a university graduate trained
in actuarial studies might be asked to work
out the significance of the figures and tell us
what amounts and contributions are required
for particular purposes. It may be remembered that some years ago the then Deputy
Minister of Labour, Mr. MacNamara, came
before the committee and told us, "We have
had to raise the cost of government annuities,
because we found that people are living
longer than the actuaries anticipated they
would". I suppose the same condition affects
pension schemes.

JUNE 21, 1954
As an aside to my honourable friend from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) I would
point out that, so long as each individual who
enters the service is a liability to the fund,
and if we continue to increase the Civil
Service at the same rate as in the last
twenty years, unless contributions are
increased the indebtedness of the pension
fund will go on growing. I believe actuaries
who examined the financial statements have
reported that the fund is about $180 million
in arrears. On this deficit the government
has agreed to pay interest. I can recall when
$100 million was paid on this account. This
condition is to be expected. If it were
intended to insure some eighty members of
the Senate, an actuary could set a basis
of contributions which would keep the fund
solvent, but if twenty more senators were
appointed and rates of payment remained
the same, the government would have to
support the fund for years. In the case
of a young woman who enters the service
at the age of twenty, contributions at the
same rate are payable for forty years; the
sum total of receipts is calculated, and presumably reserves will be put by every year.
That is what every insurance company does.
I do not want to vote against the bill,
nor for the bill. Were this an ordinary
business matter which came before me as a
businessman, I would say we should send it
to committee. We should call before us a
representative of the young women to whom
the honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) bas referred, and
we should summon somebody from the olderage groups to find out who is responsible
for bringing this matter forward, and why
it is recommended.
I do not think that service men should be
included in this plan. To me the idea is
outrageous. My own son obtained as an exservice man a $10,000 policy on his life; and
it is my recollection that insurance benefits
were extended to soldiers without any
examination at all.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:. They come under the
Veterans Insurance Act. I have such insurance myself.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have nothing against that
type of insurance. I certainly have no objection to soldiers, upon returning from service
in Korea or any other theatre of operations,
being allowed to take out insurance under
legislation like that. Furthermore, I know
that the government would give them just
as good terms as they would get under this
bill. I feel that Civil Service employees
should come under this plan, but I certainly
do not think the members of the regular
forces should. They should be dealt with

in other legislation. For these reasons I would
strongly recommend that this bill be sent to
committee, and I would further urge that
we do not act too hastily in dealing with it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: By recommending that
the bill be sent to committee you are in
effect approving of it in principle.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, my principles are
pretty elastic. The fact that I may not vote
against a bill on second reading does not
preclude me from moving an amendment
to it in committee. The honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is right
when he suggests that a person should uphold
bis principles, but I have been a member of
the Senate for quite a while now and I have
never been criticized for voting one way in
the house and another way in committee.
I think the bill should be sent to committee,
for if it has any merit at all I want our
civil servants to benefit from it. On the
other hand, I am anxious to find out if the
bill is detrimental to civil servants. If a
reasonable percentage of them object to its
compulsory features, I do not think they
should be compelled to come under it. I want
those who proposed this legislation to tell
us why they did so.
Like my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), I believe this
legislation did not originate in the mind of
any member of the government, but was
actually suggested by somebody else. However, I may be wrong in that assumption and
may be doing somebody an injustice.
The people of Canada do not want us to
be niggardly in dealing with our civil servants, but at the same time they do not want
us to be extravagant and confer benefits on
them that cannot be enjoyed by other working
classes. Perhaps I would be on the spot if
some honourable senator were to move that
the bill be given the six months' hoist, but I
still think I would vote that it be referred
to committee. As has been suggested, we
should find out in committee just what is
back of this whole thing. In the past when
some civil servants have died, other civil
servants have had to provide money to take
care of their funeral expenses, and so on.
Well, if this legislation is designed to take
care of that kind of thing it is pretty drastic.
The estates of some low-income wage earners
may benefit very little from the plan, yet
these employees will have to contribute to
it for years and years.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, like the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) I had not intended
to speak at this time, but after listening to
the debate I felt I should at least rise and
congratulate honourable senators upon their

SENATE
excellent speeches, particularly the honourable
lady from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson).
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable lady
stated that in order for a woman to be considered good she must be at least twice as
good as a member of the opposite sex. I can
assure her that her speech today has qualifled her under that word "good".
Hon. Senaîors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This legislation is not
all bad, and I think those who have spoken,
especially the honourable senator from
Fredericton, have pointed out that there are
indeed good features to it. I do not think
the honourable lady would want to cast this
bill aside without giving it the fullest consideration. This measure meets with the
approval of the great mass of civil servants,
despite the fact that, as we have been told
by the honourable senator from Fredericton
and the honourable senator from Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson), a number of women have
expressed disapproval of it. The question has
been asked: what is good in this legislation?
Well, it provides death benefits up to a maximum of $5,000 for the spouse or the estate of
a public servant or a member of the regular
forces, in addition to superannuation or pension benefits. No one can say that that is
In addition to superannuation
not good.
and pensions benefits it provides for an additional $5,000Hon.

Mrs. Fergusson: If the contributor

does not live too long.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, but if the contributor dies at the age of 60 his widow or
estate will receive his superannuation benefits plus the sum of $5,000. If he dies at
the age of 65, his widow or estate will receive
larger superannuation benefits, but the death
benefits under this act will not be as great.
In other words, the benefits under this act
decline after the contributor reaches the age
of 60, whereas superannuation benefits increase after that age.
It can be seen that a considerable amount
of benefit will come to those who participate
in this act. I will admit that single persons,
including some widowers, may not want this
insurance, but I think we have to look at the
whole picture and enact legislation that is in
the general interest of all civil servants.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: May I interject to say
that we do not have the whole picture before
us? All civil servants have not had the
chance to express their views, and I think the
honourable leader is taking too much for
granted when he says that the great mass of
civil servants are in favour of this legislation.

I know for a fact that a large majority of
female civil servants are opposed to it, and I
believe a good many men are too.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I accept the statement that a great many women are opposed
to this plan, but I have not heard of many
men being opposed to it. As a matter of
fact, my information is that most married
civil servants are in favour of it. It is hoped
that this legislation is in the best interests of
civil servants generally. I have no objection
to its being referred to committee, but I
would strenuously object to throwing it
aside without giving it the most careful
consideration.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I interrupt the
honourable leader to ask him if he knows
whether there was a demand by civil servants
for this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot answer that
question, but I can say that the bill was
introduced because it was felt it would be
in the interest of civil servants generally. It
surely was not introduced because it would
be in the interests of the government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Nobody has suggested that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is it not a fact that one

the reasons for introducing this measure
that it will replace the present gratuity
two months' salary payable on the death
a public servant?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was by no
means the purpose of it. It has been designed
to benefit civil servants generally. For
instance, upon the death of a civil service
employee at the age of sixty, his widow will
get his superannuation benefits plus $5,000.
There are considerable details which I realize
can be gone over in committee. I presume
the senator who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) intends, if it receives second reading,
to move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce. I
would heartily endorse such a motion.

Hon. Mr. Horner: Would the Leader of the

Government care to comment on the suggestion that has been made from this side of
the house that members of the regular forces

and be placed under other legislation?
Mr. Macdonald: That is another
which could be discussed in comand it is another reason why I feel
should be sent there.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
understood the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to say that the great
mass of civil servants are in favour of this
legislation. May I say that I have seen no
Hon.
matter
mittee,
the bill

JUNE 21, 1954
evidence of sucli a thing. In fact, the inf ormation I have is to, the contrary-that civil
servants generally were not consulted, except
through a few of their leaders who were
unable to discuss the provisions of the legislation with their own membership.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We can find out about al
this in committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It rnay be possible to
clear up this matter in committee. It has
been said that a civil servant can gain
advantage from the death benefits provided in
this legisiation as well as the benefits fromn
his superannuation fund. Well, if a civil
servant dies before he reaches the age of
sixty-five, he will of course not draw any
superannuation. If he dies, of course the
insurance will be paid, but I cannot see how
he can get both. Perhaps my honourable
friend can enlighten us?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would say that the
answer is given in the explanatory note in
the bill, which reads:
The purpose of this bill is to provide death bene-

fits Up to a maximum of $5.000 for the spouse or the
eatate of a public servant or a member of the

regular forces, in addition to superaxmuation

or

penaion benefits.

I take it the honourable senator asks me
that question in view of my statement that
the great mass of civil servants are in
favour of the legislation. True, I have net
consuited the great mass of them, but my
information is that their representatives
stated they were in favour of it. It may be
that their leaders were not speaking for al
the great mai ority of the civil servants, but
I have been merely stating what I understand is now on the record. These details
can be gone into in committee, and if I arn
mistaken in my information it will no doubt
be corrected.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I would point out
that if the honourable senator speaks now
he will conclude the debate.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
arn sure that we ail enjoyed the discussion
of this bull. It is natural that there should
be a discussion, and a controversial. one,
because the bill involves many people and
deals with them rather individually.
I propose to, move that this bill be referred
to the Banking and Commerce Committee,
but before doing so I would cail the attention of the house to the evidence that was
taken before the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce o! the House o!
Commons, a copy o! which I have here,

which comprises some 100 pages. Among
the witnesses heard by the committee were
the National Secretary of the Amaigamated
Civil Servants of Canada, the Assistant
Deputy Minister of the Department of
National Defence and many others.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: What is the date of
those proceedings?
Hon. Mr. Kînley: It is the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence, No. 31, of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
the chairman was David A. Croîl, M.P. I
arn sure that if honourable senators were to
read these proceedings a lot of misinformation that has been stated in the discussion
of the bill would be cleared Up.
I do flot want to press the bill further,
because I realize that there are items in it
that cannot be regarded as perfect legislation. But I want to add a few words about
some of the ghosts that have been stirred
Up by sorne honourable members who spoke
this afternoon. Some raised the ghost of
socialislTHon. Mr. Horner: It is socialism.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Section 51 (2) states:
No contract of Insurance shall be entered into
under the Civil Service Insurance Act on the lii e
of any person unless
(a) a medical examiner or a medical referee has
in accordance with the regulations under that Act
recommended wlthout qualification the acceptance
of the risk, and
(b) the medical report on the application for
the contract of Insurance was based on a medical
examination begun prior to the lst day of May,
1954.

Therefore, no further insurance will be
written.
This legislation is not insurance; it is a
Superannuation Act amendment designed to
provide for benefits that should be provided
for in that act.
May I inform. my friends that the Civil
Service Insurance Act is to be discarded,
except for past and present obligations. It
became law in 1893, when Sir John Thompson
was the Prime Minister of Canada, and no
one would accuse hlm of being at al
socialistie. The point is, honourable senators,
that we legislate for the benefit of the public,
and the principle of democracy is the greatest
good for the greatest number.
I want to say that I arn one of those who
believe in private industry, and if honourable
senators care to read the proceedings and
evidence of the Banking and Commerce
Committee in the House of Commons, to
which I have referred, I arn sure they will
be convinced that the life insurance business
is efficiently carried on. There is very strong

SENATE
competition in the business of group insurance. I know something about it, and I may
say that there is a good deal of compulsion
in the organization of a group insurance plan
in industry, because unless 75 per cent of
the employees of any one plant agree to join,
the insurance company will not make a contract at ail.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is the scheme compulsory in your own plant?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is compulsory in that
we have to have 75 per cent participation
before we can get it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is not compulsion.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: That is a degree of compulsion. Everybody seems to be unduly
frightened by the so-called compulsory
features of this legislation; to my mind, it
is merely a co-operative effort. Old age pensions are compulsory to the extent that they
require a levy of 2 per cent on everybody,
regardless of whether or not they benefit
directly. A similar illustration can be given
with respect to unemployment insurance.
Who asked the industries of this country if
they wanted the unemployment insurance
scheme? I do not believe they were asked,
but today we ail believe in the plan, for it
takes up the slack when there is unemployment. But it is a compulsory measure, in
that every workman in every industry in
Canada must participate, with very few exceptions. Taxes and customs duties and such
things are ail of a compulsory nature. The
sovereign state in this country makes the
laws it sees fit to make for the greatest
benefit of the people. For instance, the Bank
of Canada and the chartered banks are
required to participate in the unemployment
insurance scheme, but bank employees have
little hope of receiving much by way of
benefits.
It is my opinion that if it were not for
the compulsory feature of this legislation,
and the "taking up of the slack" by the government, a private enterprise scheme could
compete favourably with one offered by the
government under those conditions. In this
matter of providing group insurance, the government is dealing with its employees in the
same way as you or I might deal with our
employees and they ail want to get it at the
lowest possible price. In this instance, where
the vast majority of the people are in favour
of the plan, there may be no justification for
the compulsory feature.
It is apparent, of course, that the scheme
is not as attractive for unmarried women as
for others. In the case of superannuation,
when we cease to be employed we expect to
get back the money we paid in, because it is

money we saved; but in the case of death
benefits, they must apply equally to ail. We
pay automobile insurance, for instance, for
our protection, and we are glad when we have
had no accidents and no claims under it.
This insurance plan will protect a civil
servant to the extent of $1,000 for a premium
of 40 cents a month, or $4.80 a year. Will
anybody tell me where civil servants can
get life insurance under these conditions for
such a low premium? I emphasize that the
low premium is possible only by reason of
the compulsory feature which requires full
participation.
Much has been said this afternoon about
socialism and the rights of labour. I would
remind my friends that in earlier days we
would not hesitate to tell prospective employees that an insurance plan such as this
was a condition of their employment; if they
wanted to work for us, they had to participate
in the scheme, but they were not compelled
to work for us.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend a question in connection with the
subject of group insurance? Is he aware of
the fact that in this country there are more
companies giving group insurance coverage
gratuitously to their employees than those
which force it upon them?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I do not of course think
that private enterprises could direct a plan
of this nature in the same manner in which
the government could direct it. After ail,
the government makes the laws of the country
in the interests of the public. You usually
get what you pay for.
There has been a good deal of discussion
this afternoon which did not go to the root
of the bill itself. But it was mentioned that
the bill provided that the benefits under the
plan must go to the spouse, or the estate of
the deceased person, or the Treasury Board
would decide on their disposition.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Why is that so?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is in the bill, and I
am not going to attempt to defend it. I
merely want to say that while we hear that
many women are against the measure, it
would appear that women are the persons
who will benefit most by it. But I hold no
brief for that particular provision, and if it
is the wish of this bouse that it be removed,
I take no stand one way or the other.
When we are talking about compulsion, I
would remind honourable senators of the
Rand formula, as devised by Mr. Justice
Rand, formerly a prominent New Brunswick
jurist, in which he said that if the majority

JUNE 21, 1954
belong to a scheme and all benefit directly
or indirectly from it, all should contribute
to it.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: Did my friend say that
Mr. Justice Rand was a justice in the province
of New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I said he comes from the
province of New Brunswick; he is now a
member of the Supreme Court of Canada.
According to information received when
this bill was before a committee of the other
house, the ratio of men to women in the
public service is about seven to one. The
question has been asked as to how we know
whether the premiums provided by this legislation are adequate to maintain it. Of course
we do not know any more than what the
actuaries have told us. However, there has
been a great deal of experience by private
companies in group insurance plans, and we
should benefit by it. But if this plan does
not work out and we need more money to
carry it on, that may be all to the good for
the country. In the matter of children's
allowances, for instance, the consequential
increase in population has resulted in larger
contributions to meet the increasing need.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Did the honourable
senator say that the ratio of men to women
in the public service was seven to one?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes, about that.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: In the answer to
an inquiry made by me of the government
leader, it is said that there are 30,389 women
in the public service; and Mr. Taylor, while
testifying before the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the other house, said there
was a total of approximately 120,000 public
servants. Therefore, the ratio would not
seem to be seven to one.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, I took my figures
from the evidence that was given before the
Banking and Commerce Committee of the
House of Commons.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I know that Mr.
Taylor gave evidence as to that, because I
attended the meetings of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I understood Mr. Taylor
to say that there are about 30,000 on the
government payroll in a normal month who
are not under the Superannuation Act and
would not come under this proposed legislation. He said that the average number on
the payroll fluctuates at around 100,000 in
the non-military public service. The number
that would corne under this proposed addition to the Superannuation Act is about
123,000. About 27,000 people, some of whom
are employed from time to time and some
continuously, would not come under this

Act. As to the number of women in the
Civil Service, I understood that there were
23,149 temporaries and 7,240 permanents employed as of October 1953.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: As I read the evidence,
there were several complaints that they had
not been given an opportunity to be heard.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, there was a long
discussion in committee.
The cost of this type of insurance depends
on three or four factors. It depends on
the age group of the employees, on the
hazards of the industry, on the size of the
group, and also on what you expect to get
out of it in the way of benefits. Those are
the factors which determine the cost of this
type of insurance.
If the younger people do not want to pay
because they feel they will not get any
benefits from the scheme for a long time, all
I can say is that in time the younger people
will become older and they, in their turn,
will receive the benefits.
This legislation takes away the two months'
salary which the family of a deceased civil
servant would receive from the government
after his death, and provides for payment
of insurance equal to a year's salary up to a
maximum amount of $5,000, which must be
paid to the family or estate of the deceased
on his death. I believe it is a good arrangement. This legislation is completely in line
with social legislation requirements, and I
must say that the compulsory feature that
we hear so much talk about is not so very
frightening.
From the evidence of the President of the
Civil Service Federation of Canada given
before the Banking and Commerce Committee of the other place on June 3, 1954, to be
found at page 1689 of the report of the proceedings, I see that he does not object to
the compulsory feature of the bill, but does
recommend that single employees be allowed
to insure for half their salary. Now, that
might solve the difficulty.
This idea of compulsion being such a
bogey does not seem to me to add up to the
experience of the past, nor do I see that
anybody is going to be very much hurt by
having this compulsory feature in legislation.
Every civil servant will have protection
when all come in under the scheme. And because of universal coverage the premiums
will be less, as there will be no expense for
going out and getting business. Also the
administration will be much simpler, so that
the lowest possible rates can be made available, and that is the intention of this
legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN SLOVAK LEAGUE-COMMONS
AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the House of Commons to Bill N-15, an Act to incorporate
Canadian Slovak League.
Hon. John J. Connolly moved concurrence in the amendment.
He said: Honourable senators, it will take
only a few moments to deal with the amendment which has been proposed for this bill
in the House of Commons. In the original
bill clause 5 provides:
Only persons deemed by the society to be loyal
to the free institutions of Canada and to the
Christian and democratic traditions of the Slovak
nation ...

shall be entitled to belong to the organization.
The amendment changes this to read as
follows:

Only persons deemed by the society to be of
Slovak origin and loyal to the free institutions of
Canada and Christian and democratic traditions ...

The amendment, I think, is really a distinction without a difference, but I understand
that in certain quarters of the House of
Commons, under the original wording, it
was suggested that in addition to the loyalty
to this country there was also an implied
loyalty to another state. I think, in fact, that
that interpretation could not be placed upon
the language that was originally in the
sectionHon. Mr. Aselline: Have you any objection
to this amendment?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is all we want to
know.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I would suggest to
honourable members that the amendment is
one we should readily accept.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendment was concurred in.

THE LATE SENATOR EMMERSON
TRIBUTES TO RIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon, W. Ross Macdonald: Hanaurable
senatars, befare the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, I would like ta refer ta the
passing yesterday of aur dearly belaved
cahleague Senator Emmersan. The news of
hîs death came as a great shock ta ail of us,
for when we had seen him a few days
earlier he appeared ta be in excellent health
and high spirits. However, we cannot tell
when the hand af death will strike. The
suddenness with which it struck an thîs
occasion ca'used us to be mare than usualhy
shocked.
I had known our hate calleague for many
years, and we had several things in common.
We served tagether in the First World War,
althaugh I did nat knaw him persanally at
that time. We contested aur flrst general
election in the same year, 1926, he in New
Brunswick and I in Ontario, and we bath
last. In 1930 we bath tried ag-ain, and agaîn
were unsuccessful; but in 1935 we tried once
mare and were elected ta the House of Commons, whe're we sat continuously fram that
time until 1949, when he came ta the Senate.
I continued an in that house, and j oined hlm
here in 1953.
I should also refer ta the fact that Senatar
Emmersan's son, Bertram, received his training as a pilot at No. 5 Service Flying Training Schooh at Brantford, Ontario. I saw
hlm make his first sala flight, and I was
present when he received his pihat's wings.
As honaurable senatars know, later he was

SENATE

reported missing in operations, and was
never found. He gave his life for his
country.
The late Senator Emmerson was born at
Dorchester, New Brunswick, on November 7,
1883. His father, who had a distinguished
career as a public man, was for a time Prime
Minister of his native province, and was
subsequently elected to parliament and
became Minister of Railways and Canals in
the Laurier government. Senator Emmerson
was educated a.t Horton College and Acadia
University in Nova Scotia, and graduated
from the faculty of applied science at McGill
University, with the degree of Mechanical
Engineer.
Following his distinguished service overseas in the first great war, during which he
rose to the rank of Major, he took up farming operations in his native province. Also,
from that time onward he played an active
part in the affairs of his community. I
do not need to dwell on Senator Emmerson's accomplishments on behalf of his
community, of his province, and of the whole
nation, for we are well aware of the very
valuable contributions he made in all three
fields.
I am sure the house joins me in extending
heartfelt sympathy at this time to his widow,
and his surviving seven daughters and four

sons.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak on the passing of Senator
Emmerson I find myself in some difficulty,
for I did not know him until he entered this
chamber in the second session of 1949. He
was a quiet, unassuming man, very regular
in his attendance and very faithful to his
duties in this chamber.
I feel that contributions such as he has
made to ousr country, first as a soldier, and
afterwards as a member of the House of
Commons and subsequently as a senator,
stamped him as the ideal public servant. It
is men like him whom I like to see appointed
to this chamber, because they represent the
real Canadian spirit that exists in our country. He had wide experience in various
walks of life, and he gave of himself
unsparingly to whatever he undertook. All
Canadians owe him a great debt of gratitude
for the fine service he rendered to this
country, and the people of New Brunswick
are to be commended for sending such a
man as Senator Emmerson to parliament.
I join with the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in expressing to our
late colleague's widow and children the
sympathy of all of us in their bereavement.
Hon. George P. Burchill: Honourable senators, while the leaders of both sides have
paid tribute to Senator Emmerson and have

covered his career very well, I should like
to add my expressions of personal sorrow
at the passing of our colleague, for he was
a very close friend of mine and my roommate here.
The name of Emmerson, as has been intimated, has been identified with the history
of New Brunswick politics for more than
half a century. His father, the late Honourable Henry Robert Emmerson, was Premier
of New Brunswick for a period of time, and
during his premiership my father served as
Speaker of the Legislature; so there was
always a close bond of friendship between
our families, and my association with the
late senator has extended over many years.
As the honourable leader has intimated,
Senator Emmerson's father was at one time
a member of the House of Commons. He
represented the province of New Brunswick
with great distinction and acceptance, and
became Minister of Railways and Canals in
the cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Our late colleague, as has been intimated,
was a veteran of the First World War. After
the war he entered public life, and he was
elected to the House of Commons from the
county of Westmorland in the general elections of 1935, 1940 and 1945.
On an occasion such as this, honourable
senators, it is very difficult to find words to
say just what one would like to say. If
Senator Emmerson had any warning that he
was not well, he certainly kept it to himself.
That would have been characteristic of the
man. He was quiet, unassuming, retiring,
and most kindly; and what virtue, honourable senators, is there that lingers in the
memory more than kindness?
Senator
Emmerson had a great capacity for friendship. He had those qualities of heart and
mind which drew people to him in friendship and kept them so. I do not think that
Henry Emmerson had an enemy. Here on
Parliament Hill, not only in the Senate and
in the House of Commons, but among the
officials and the staff, and down in his native
province of New Brunswick and his county
of Westmorland, his friends were legion. He
served his county conscientiously and well.
No problem, however small, which was
passed to him was unworthy of his best
efforts to solve. He was devoted to his
family. I think it can be said that he lived
for them.
He has gone to another sphere, and he
has left behind a host of unforgettable
memories of a true friend. I join with his
countless friends everywhere in mourning
his loss, and I extend my deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Emmerson and his family.

JUNE 22,
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson:

Honourable

senators, through the years my family bas
had a very close association with the family
of the late Senator Emmerson, for I was
born and lived until my marriage only about
His
twenty-five miles from his home.
father, to whorn reference bas already been
made, and to whose career as an illustrious
representative of New Brunswick I need not
further allude, was a very intimate and
beloved friend of my late father. Senator
Emmerson and my older brother, the late
E. W. McQueen, were very closely associated,
because my late brother died while he was
a member of the New Brunswick Legislature,
and during some of the tirne while he was
one of the Liberal representatives of Westmorland county in the provincial legislature
the late Senator Emmerson was the Liberal
representative of the locality in the federal
bouse. Naturally these activities brought
them together on many occasions. Further,
the late Senator Emmerson's sister, Mrs.
W. A. K. McQueen, is the widow of my
cousin.
For all of these reasons I felt in a special
sense a personal bereavement at the word
of his passing. I know that everyone in
Westmorland county will be grieved, for he
was known throughout the county and
throughout the province. As the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchill) has said, no problem of anyone in
Westmorland county was too small for his
attention. He was a very kindly man and
showed great interest in people. He was a
soldier in the first world war, and gave
thereby service to his country even beyond
that which he gave in parliament. He will
certainly be greatly missed but I am sure
that he will long be remembered by the
people of our province, particularly those of
Westmorland county for whom he did so
many things. It is good for us to know
that to live in the hearts of those we leave
behind is not to die, and I believe that is
true of Senator Emmerson.
To Mrs. Emmerson, and to their sons and
daughters and to Senator Emmerson's sisters,
I extend my truly heartfelt sympathy.
OIL PAINTINGS IN SENATE CHAMBER
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I should like to bring to the attention of the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a matter affecting the Senate. I am
sure many honourable senators are unaware
of the history of the eight oil paintings hanging in this chamber. They belong to a group
of some one hundred oil paintings depicting

1954

scenes of World War I, which were presented
to the Canadian Government by Lord Beaverbrook. To this date the government has been
unable to find suitable places in which to
hang the other paintings in this collection,
and they are now stored in the basement of
the National Museum at Ottawa. I think
the eight canvasses in this chamber were not
intended to serve as a war memorial, but
were merely placed over large openings in
the walls until such time as the walls were
finished.
As honourable senators know, a fine tradition has grown up over the years with respect
to these paintings. During the tourist season
they are shown daily to hundreds of visitors.
Veterans of World War I are in particular
quick to recognize many of the scenes
depicted. I am just wondering whether these
paintings are to be left in this chamber as
a war memorial. If so, I think the time has
come to make some recognition of the services of the Canadian men and women who
fought in World War II. Recently a memorial
service was held in England commemorating
the passing of 22,000 allied airmen who gave
their lives in the last war, and whose graves
are unknown.
The Leader of the Government, in paying
tribute to the memory of our late colleague
Senator Emmerson, remarked that they both
had served in World War I. I thought this
would be an opportune time to suggest that
Canadians who gave up their lives in the
last war should be honoured by pictures in
this chamber depicting scenes of their
services.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am glad that the honourable gentleman
frorn New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) bas
brought this matter to the attention of the
Senate. It is, of course, a question which
would have to be considered by our Standing
Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts. I am in agreement to a
large extent with what the honourable gentleman bas said, and I feel that if any war
paintings at all are to be hung in this chamber we should have a representation of scenes
from both world wars. However, it occurs to
me that the Senate chamber may not be the
place at all for paintings of this type. It
might be more appropriate to hang them
elsewhere. However, as I say, it is a matter
which must be considered by our Internal
Economy Committee, and I would think that
then perhaps it should be considered by the
corresponding committee of the House of
Commons.

SENATE
COMMITTEE MEETINGS
CHANGE IN TIMES

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with,
may I refer to an important matter of much
interest to many of us here? I have received
at my desk notices of two important meetings
to be held tomorrow morning: the one, at
10 o'clock, is a special meeting of the Banking
and Commerce Committee to deal with the
Public Service Superannuation Bill; the
other, at 10.30, is a meeting of the Canadian
Trade Relations Committee. The Chairman
of the latter committee (Hon. Mr. McLean)
was not present this morning when the
Banking and Commerce Committee decided
to hold a meeting at 10 o'clock tomorrow.
That meeting probably would not finish
before 11, and many of us would like to
be free to go to the Trade Relations committee and hear the distinguished gentleman
whom the chairman has arranged to bring
here.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
chairman of the Canadian Trade Relations
Committee (Hon. Mr. McLean) has done a
great service in obtaining outstanding witnesses for the committee. I think the suggestion of the Leader of the Government,
that the Trade Relations committee meet at
10 o'clock, and the Banking committee at 11,
is a good one.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I think that could be
arranged. I am very glad the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) brought this up,
because I was perplexed when I saw these
notices. I should have known about the
change in time the moment it was made.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is that agreed, then?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Do we understand that
the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations will meet at 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; and the Banking and
Commerce Committee will meet at 11 o'clock.

JUNE 22. 1954
the provinces together for a conference on
the matter and asked: "How can we work
this out?" This is the proposal that was
agreed upon, and I cannot think of a better
way of dealing with the question. The delegates themselves could not think of a better
way, and I do not think a better one has
been proposed. I repeat, it is in that attitude
that I am bringing this bill to the house.
Probably I might amplify some of the
remarks that have been made with regard
to questions asked by honourable senators.
I should point out that provision is made
for the regulation of tariffs and tolls charged
by federal carriers for the transport of goods
and passengers. That is to say, if tariffs and
tolls for local traffic are regulated by provincial law, extra-provincial traffic is to be
regulated in the same manner as tariffs and
tolls for local traffie are determined. In
saying this I am amplifying to some extent
the answer I gave a few minutes ago.
Probably I should also add a little to
what I said in connection with section 5.
By this clause the governor in council "may
exempt any person or the whole of any part
of an extra-provincial undertaking or any
extra-provincial transport from all or any
of the provisions of this act". This clause
was inserted for three purposes, which I
might summarize as follows:
First, there is the case of a province such
as Nova Scotia. All interprovincial traffic
originating there and destined for Quebec
or Ontario must pass through New Brunswick. The purpose of this clause is to protect
the position of a province such as Nova
Scotia in the event that New Brunswick
should seek to prohibit through traffic of
an interprovincial nature.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Just how?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: By the putting into
effect of clause 5.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes: in what manner?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, by exempting
it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Under federal authority.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under the federal
authority retained in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Then the federal government does not actually delegate its
authority over transport?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, not all authority;
but I think clause 5 is definitely an escape
clause. I prefer not to use the term "delegation", and certainly not "a delegating of
authority".
Secondly, there is the matter of international undertakings such as the movement

of trucking across certain highways of a type
of goods agreed upon under GATT. In that
general agreement on tariffs and trade there
is reference to transportation of goods along
Obviously, as such
Canadian highways.
shipments are subject to these international
agreements, they must be safeguarded.
Thirdly, there is the question of the movement of defence vehicles across the provinces
and into the Territories in order to give
effect to what might be regarded as a necessity. I think I can safely say that the provincial authorities agree that this exempting
clause is both necessary and desirable, and
that none of them object to it.
Section 6, pertaining to penalties, speaks
for itself.
One other provision is that the rights of
the provinces to make their individual
decisions in respect to this matter are
recognized. The measure is not forced upon
any province; and by section 7 only upon
the affirmative decision of any province shall
the statute be declared to come into effect
in that area.
I hope I have fully explained the bill. It
is an important but not a complicated one.
I trust honourable senators understand it. If
they do not, I can only suppose that my
explanation has made it more complicated
than it is.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would not say that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In any event I
recommend it to the favourable consideration
of this bouse.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I want to thank the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for hisand I say this with all candour-very clear
explanation. It seems to me, however, that
underlying this measure is a principle which
should be carefully examined. The first
point about the bill is, as the honourable
leader has said, that the Parliament of
Canada, which under a privy council decision is empowered to deal with interprovincial trade as respects trucking and so on,
has seen fit to pass along its authority, subject to certain restrictions, to the provinces.
It is therefore important that we should
decide whether the dominion government or
parliament should control this traffic, the
rates, and everything connected therewith.
Assuming for the sake of argument that
we decide it is better to transfer authority
to the provinces, we must then look at the
bill to see if, under this proposed legislation,
the rights of the provinces, the dominion and
the truckers are properly protected. Off-hand,
not as a considered opinion but having heard

would say that the bill pretty well hands that the law of diminishing returns has
over to the provinces jurisdiction over and begun to operate. It is my opinion that the
management of the trucking system and its various provinces will probably deal with
the control and regulation of interprovincial
operations.

JUNE 22, 1954
can our transportation problems be solved.
Canada must maintain its railway system on
a sound basis if it is to remain a nation. As a
matter of fact, this country would never
have developed into a nation had it not been
for the promise of a railway to link the east
with west. The existence of this overland
transportation system is just as vital today
as it ever was. I think the Canadian government, by introducing this legislation, has
taken the easy and wrong turn. It is much
easier to ask the provincial governments to
control and regulate interprovincial and
international highway transportation than to
ask the Board of Transport Commissioners to
do so. My honourable friends may say that
in Canada there are more truckers than railway presidents with a vote.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Perhaps the comparison should be between truckers and railway employees, not railway presidents.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so. At any
rate, the trouble is that this whole question
is not so important to the people of Ontario
and Quebec as it is to those living in the
rest of Canada. Although I have always
lived in a large railroad city, I have never
worried about the truckers' vote. I ran for
office a lot of times and I always had a keen
appreciation of the value of certain votes.
I was always careful not to attack the
truckers, and I don't think I made a mistake,
for the results seemed to justify my conduct.
But this question is greater than an election
issue. I do not think our agricultural industry can survive unless there is some let-up
in freight rates. During the past ten years
representatives of every section in Canada
except Ontario and Quebec have appeared
before the Board of Transport Commissioners. Ontario and Quebec have not had
to do so, because they are sitting on top of
the world. For one thing, they have plenty
of water transportation, and the Canadian
people are soon going to spend millions of
dollars to improve this system.
I will admit that even from a careful reading of the bill I am unable to suggest any
changes in it, although I am positive that
changes will eventually be made. To borrow
words I have heard the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) use, "more will be heard about this
legislation in the future." Honourable senators, are we going to prejudice our Canadian
railway system by putting control and
regulation of interprovincial and international highway transport in the hands of
the individual provinces? That is what we
will be doing by passing this legislation.
There are two fundamental issues at stake

here and I think every member of this chamber should take his stand on them. The
people of Newfoundland are not affected.
The two Maritime Provinces, Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, and the four Western
provinces, however, are vitally affected. I
am persuaded that at this time this measure
is not in the best interests of our country.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
the purpose of this bill is only to fill the
gap created by the decision of the Privy
Council. Prior to that decision, provincial
institutions regulated truck traffic on the
highway. Every truck company or truck
owner had to obtain a licence as public carrier within the province. A trucker within
a province carried on his trade under licence
from the province; and when he crossed a
provincial border he operated under a
licence from the other province. That system
must continue for a certain time at least,
and this bill meets this requirement. It is
an important piece of legislation, but it is
only provisional. We shall hear from the
operators before very long, for questions
will arise which are not settled by this bill
and further legislation will be required.
This bill is not a delegation of power.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If it is not a delegation
of power, what is it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, what is it?
Hon. Mr. Vien: It is a measure to empower
provincial boards to issue licences. The
federal government still retains all its power,
as defined by the Privy Council. Let honourable senators read the bill. They will
find that there is no delegation of our constitutional powers.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is not a permanent
delegation of power, but there is a temporary one.
Hon. Mr. Vien: We allow provincial boards
to issue licences to operators who carry on
extra-provincial trade. Interprovincial trade
is already regulated and restricted to public
licensees. This bill, if enacted, will apply
only in such provinces as have at present
a board and laws regulating such traffic.
Probably most of the provinces have a board
now, but if any province has not, this bill
will not apply to it. I ask honourable senators
to read section 3 of the bill. I would also
refer to section 5, which states:
The governor in council may exempt any person or the whole or any part of an extra-provincial
undertaking or any extra-provincial transport from
all or any of the provisions of this act.

It is obvious that we are not delegating our
constitutional powers. We are retaining the

SENATE
right to exempt any extra-provincial operator from the application of the act.
Further, section 7 reads:
This act shall come into force in a province only
upon the issue of a proclamation of the governor
in council declaring it to be in force in that
province.

It is the Governor General in Council,
and not the Lieutenant Governor of a province, who retains the right to issue a
proclamation declaring the act to be in force
in any province.
In view of the decision of the Privy Council, legislation must be enacted. Otherwise,
licences to truckers operating beyond the
boundaries of one province would lapse
and become null and void. Extra-provincial
bus and truck traffic is declared to be within
the jurisdiction of the federal government.
We must protect truckers and bus operators
and owners and their patrons by some kind
of legislation.
This legislation, therefore,
merely fills that gap, but it is incomplete.
Let us suppose, for example, that the governor in council exempts the extra-provincial
trade of a trucker or bus operator in whole
or in part from the application of this act.
Under such circumstances, who will regulate
the extra-provincial transport so exempted?
No provision is made in this bill to cover
that situation. If a bus owner or a trucker
is licensed by the province of Nova Scotia, for
example, to operate across other provinces to
the Pacific coast, or into the United States,
and if Quebec, New Brunswick or any other
intermediate province passes regulations preventing such bus or truck operator from
carrying on his trade across its territory by
refusing him a licence, what will he be able
to do? This bill provides no other solution
than under its saving clauses 5 and 7. He
might be exempted from the application of
this act or this act might perhaps be made
inapplicable to such province by withholding
publication of the proclamation until the
laws and regulations of that province are
brought into harmony with those of other
provinces for the promotion of interprovincial or international trade.
These two saving clauses demonstrate quite
fully, I think, my proposition that this bill
does not delegate our constitutional powers,
but simply enables a province which has laws
or regulations acceptable to federal authoritics to use them with respect to interprovincial trade.
Formerly trucks could carry a load of not
more than three to five tons; they could not
then travel easily with heavy loads over
long distances. But as we improved our
highways, trucks were able to carry much
bigger loads, as much as twenty to twentyfive tons. Tractors and trailers now haul

huge loads from one end of the country
to the other, and load and unload at all
intermediate points. The operations have
become profitable to their owners and satisfactory to their patrons as regards rates
and quality of service. But we must determine by legislation who shall prepare, issue
and publish rates and regulations governing
such traffic so as to ensure greater safety
for passengers and freight transported by
bus and truck, interprovincially and internationally. Bus and truck operators meet
at conventions in Canada and the United
States and consult one another, and they
decide, whith the constituted authorities,
what should be donc to bring about orderly
regulations so as to ensure the safety and
adequacy of the services and the reasonableness of the rates charged.
This bill should be refererd to a committee
of the Senate. Necessary provisions which
the bill does not seem to provide, might,
after due consideration and ample discussion
with departmental officials, be added.
Section 5 is causing a great deal of concern to a number of truck operators, and
they have written to me in that regard. They
would like to know whom the government
has in mind to exempt from all or any of
the provisions of this act; and if a truck
system of transportation is exempted, who
shall be the regulating authority with respect
to
the
transportation
undertaking
so
exempted.
And as regards section 7, which states that
publication of a proclamation will bring the
act into force in a province, what are the
conditions which will determine such publication or
the
withholding
of
such
publication?
These and other questions will arise. This
legislation is timely; it fills a gap created by
the decision of the Privy Council; but, for
the protection of the public, it should be sent
to a committee, where we might have more
opportunity to study it.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I shall be brief. I really congratulate the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), for it seemed to me he was having a
very difflcult time to convince even himself
of the justice of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Horner: In my opinion this bill is
purely and simply a vacating by the federal
government of its proper duty in connection
with truck transportation. I was delighted
when the Winner case was decided as it was.
For some time now I have been interested
in this whole question, coming as I do from
a point further west than my leader. I realize

JUNE 22, 1954
the immense inroads that trans-Canada trucking is making in my own province particularly on the earnings of the railways.
In referring to one phase of the question,
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said that the railways
own their own rights-of-way. What about
the Canadian National Railways? The government of Canada and the people of Canada
own that system just as surely as the provinces own the highways-and as to the transCanada highway, the federal government is
paying dollar for dollar with the provinces
toward the cost of building it.
I gather from this bill that the federal government is vacating its power to regulate
truck transportation to nine different governments, in spite of the Privy Council decision.
Surely that case was not conducted through
the courts without any cost whatever to the
federal government. But now that a decision
has been rendered in favour of the federal
government, any benefit it would enjoy as a
result of the decision is being washed out by
this bill.
I had hoped that some action would be
taken by parliament in connection with the
unnecessary slaughter that is occurring on
the highways-and in some cases these huge
truck transports have something to do with it.
I think I told the house about my motor trip
west via the trans-Canada route three years
ago and particularly of the barren territory
where both railways pass and which provides
absolutely no traffic to support either of them.
It is often referred to as the link between
the prairie provinces and eastern Canada.
As I was motoring along in that territory
late one afternoon I saw four huge transport
trucks the size of box cars coming towards me.
While there was room for us to pass, they
were coming at about sixty miles an hour,
and I feared I would be pushed off the road.
That is an example of the hazards motorists
have to meet on our highways every day.
Incidentally, while these huge transport
trucks were loaded, the railways were operating through that territory with empty box
cars. When the trans-Canada highway is completed we may expect a still greater flow of
transport traffic and more competition for
the railways.
I must commend the province of Quebec
for what it has done to reduce the speed
limit of transport trucks and buses on highways. Comparing a trip I took on a bus in
that province a year ago with one I took
over the past week-end, I noticed there has
been quite a reduction in speed. The legal
speed limit for buses and trucks on Quebec
highways was reduced, I understand, as a
result of a very serious accident that happened last winter on a Quebec highway,

when a loaded bus took fire, causing some
seventeen deaths and serious injury to many
passengers. In that case the bus was passing a huge transport-trailer and the vehicles
side-swiped. The report of a board of investigation showed that one or both vehicles
had been travelling at an excessive speed.
Since then the speed limit for trucks and
buses on Quebec highways has been reduced to a maximum of forty-five miles an
hour. Incidentally, I must say that it makes
for more pleasant bus travel.
I believe that the federal government
should do something to regulate the speed
of trucks and buses travelling across country;
and I would go so far as to say that it should
do something to regulate the type of traffic
that the railways may handle exclusively.
In my opinion this bill would allow the
government to evade its duty, and certainly
to delegate its power. It is true that if the
bill is passed and it proves unsatisfactory the
law can be altered later on by parliament.
I think I have made my position clear. I
am disappointed with this legislation, and
therefore opposed to it. In my opinion it is
not the right thing to do, and I forecast that
it will not work to the betterment of Canada.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I found it difficult to follow the reasoning
of the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) when he said that under this
bill authority was not being delegated to
the provinces. If I understand the King's
English, the bill does delegate authority.
Subsection 2 of section 3 provides:
The provincial transport board in each province
may in its discretion issue a licence to a person
to operate an extra-provincial undertaking into or
through the province upon the like terms and conditions and in the like manner as if the extraprovincial undertaking operated in the province
were a local undertaking.

When this bill becomes law provincial
transport boards will have authority which
they do not now have. How can the honourable senator say that we are not delegating
federal powers to provincial boards when
the bill reads so clearly on that point?
One aspect of this bill which surprises me
was, I think, overlooked by the honourable
leader.
Since Confederation the federal
authority has said 'to the provinces, "You
have no right to regulate interprovincial
traffic." We took a definite stand on that
point, but in order to clear the atmosphere,
legal action was undertaken, which reaffirmed
that stand. Why are we now changing our
position?
It was all very well for the honourable
leader to say that the provinces met in
conference with the federal authority. The
provinces have always wanted this power,

the provincial governments, but the power that, as the bill now stands, there is going

JUNE 22, 1954
to be conflict in so far as our provincial
jurisdiction is concerned. I can quite appreciate the hesitation of Quebec ta agree ta this
measure. I am wondering how it can possibly
be workable. If a trucking firm in New
Brunswick or Nova Scotia wants ta move
goods and merchandise to, let us say, Manitoba, and is unable ta pass through Quebec,
will the federal government step in and say,
"We are going ta set up a board to direct
the Quebec authorities to issue a licence ta
permit that trucking firm ta travel over highways which Quebec has ta maintain?". I am
speaking solely, of course, from a layman's
point of view.
With regard ta licences, I have heard
more than once the statement that in each
province-in Nova Scotia, in New Brunswick, in Ontario, in Quebec and sa onthrough which the trucker passes, a licence
must be obtained. I do not believe that is
quite in accordance with the facts. I understand that a reciprocal arrangement exists
between most of the provinces sa that a
truck may, except in one or two of the
provinces, travel unhindered from the Atlantic ta the Pacific. I think that such an
arrangement also exists in certain of the
New England states. Therefore, I do not
think that what has been said on this point
is a sound argument in support of the bill.
However, my main purpose in rising is ta
urge that the bill be referred ta committee
sa that honourable senators may be told
what is behind it and who asked for it. I
would particularly like ta receive clarification with respect ta section 5 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is the honourable gentleman in favour of the principle of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is pretty difficult ta
answer.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thought so, but if
you vote for the bill on second reading you
are in effect agreeing with it in principle.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: If certain factors are satisfactorily explained in committee I might find
that I am in favour of the bill. If I thought
it would be beneficial ta all provinces I would
be quite ready ta vote in its favour; but I
would have ta satisfy myself as ta certain
points, and at the moment I am not in such
a frame of mind as ta be able ta answer in
the affirmative.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
approve the principle expressed in section 5
of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If it meant that the
whole legislation could be nullified, I would.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, how is the honourable senator ta tell?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask a question
ta clarify a point I have in mind? Do I
understand that the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said that he is opposed ta
this bill because it proposes ta hand back ta
the provinces the control of traffic over roads
within their boundaries, and that he wants
the federal government ta retain such
control?
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a senator from Manitoba I am absolutely opposed ta this legislation.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
the discussion that has taken place reveals
pretty clearly the difficulties and complexities of the problem this bill seeks ta salve.
If my memory serves me right, the railways
in Canada were originally declared ta be
works for the general advantage of Canada,
and as such they came under federal jurisdiction. In the process of time a tribunal
of a regulatory character was set up, and
that tribunal has continued to function down
ta this day. The roads and highways of
Canada are in a somewhat different category.
If I understood the argument of the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), it was ta
the effect that turning the control of interprovincial truck transport over ta the provinces would operate against the development
of an effective competition with the railways.
There is something ta that argument, but
how are we going ta get control over these
trucking operations interprovincially?
The
court has held that that power resides in
the federal government, but it did not and
could not say how it was ta be exercised.
Theoretically, if a truck starts from Halifax
with a load of goods for Vancouver, under
federal control the rates of charge, the speed
at which the truck could travel, the weight
of load, and factors of that kind would be
determined by the federal authorities.

bill the federal government could nullify the arrangement that becomes very difficult,

through eight separate jurisdictions. What
charges will the various provinces impose
on the truck and its load? Will those charges
vary? Will the regulations respecting the
weight of the load vary? In Manitoba, and
I presume the same is true in other provinces, the weight that a truck can carry is
limited at certain seasons of the year because
of the impact it makes on the roads. As a
matter of fact, at all times the weights of
loads are limited, for the simple reason that
provincial highways are built with money
supplied by the taxpayers of the province.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Not entirely.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Except for the TransCanada highway.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And it would be the
Trans-Canada highway over which these
trucks would pass.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I would point out that
after the Trans-Canada highway is built the
provinces will have to maintain it. It is
quite clear that the provinces have an interest in this matter. This bill, while it may
not be the answer to the problem-indeed I
doubt very much if it isHon. Mr. Haig: I knew my honourable
friend would say that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -this bill at least makes
a start at a solution which ultimately may
be arrived at by the process of trial and
error. If all highways in every province of
Canada were to be declared works for the
general advantage of Canada, the provinces
would completely cease to have any control
over them, and the control would reside in
the federal authority. I arn sure there is no
one in this chamber who would argue for
a moment or indeed could argue successfully
that that would be a desirable thing to do.
That is a matter which I personally would
be opposed to, for the subject of roads and
highways within provinces surely is one that
should come under provincial control and
direction.
All this emphasizes that the problem is not
an easy one of solution. It goes down into
the very regions of relationships between
the federal and provincial authorities. It
seems to me that in large measure these
should be worked out by some process of trial
and error, so that ultimately we may arrive
at a solution that is in the best interests of
all Canadians. For that reason I have no
hesitation in supporting this measure I do

not think it is the complete answer to the
problem, but it is probably the best temporary solution.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
if I were asked the question now whether
or not I was in favour of the principle of
this bill I would have considerable difficulty
in answering it. My answer, I think, would
be that this is a temporary measure that is
necessary for the time being, in the light of
the Privy Council decision in the Winner
case, in order to ensure that the present
interprovincial trucking business of the country can continue to be carried on, and to that
extent I feel that the measure deserves our
support. However, we should not forget that
it is a temporary measure and that we have
not by any means arrived at a solution to
this question or reached a final decision
about it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It seems to me that
it is one of the questions that bring into
play, and perhaps one might say into conflict, the local interest and the general
interest in a very striking way. Take the
local interest: as I have had occasion to
remark before, I happen to represent in this
chamber a part of the province of Quebec
which has a boundary with the province of
Ontario extending over many hundreds of
miles. A great deal of local traffic travels
across the bridges between the two provinces
every hour of every day of the year. To give
one illustration: it seems to me rather ridiculous to suggest that the federal authority
should attempt to regulate every single truck
which passes across the Interprovincial
Bridge, for instance, during the course of the
day.
But let us look at it from the national
point of view, and at the general transportation position as it exists in this country. Our
railroads, airlines and lake transport are all
subject to federal jurisdiction. And here we
have a fourth mode of transport, trucking,
which for the time being, under this bill, is
to remain under provincial jurisdiction. I do
not hesitate to say that I think that ultimately there will have to be some form of
federal regulation of interprovincial trucking in its largest sense, and that problem is
becoming more urgent year by year. It was
less important when the roads were not very
good and the only interprovincial trucking
that existed was the movement of lumber
across the line from Nova Scotia to New
Brunswick, and so on; but we are reaching
a position, honourable senators, like that
which has already been reached in the
United States, where, for instance, fleets of

JUNE 22, 1954
enormous truck transports start out fromn
southern Caifornia with loads of fruit and
go across the country to New York and to
Boston. Frankly, I do flot know what solution they have found lin the United States,
but 1 would be surprised if they have flot
some sort of federal regulation to cope with
trucking of that order of magnitude.
Therefore, although I amn quite wiMling to
support this bill as an interim measure,
purely for the purpose of ameliorating the
position which resulted from the Winner
judgment, on the other hand, I agree with
what has already been said by several honourable senators i this debate, that we have
flot yet reached finality on this problem, and
that some day and in some way it will be
the duty of the parliament of Canada to see
that there is one special authority for the
broad movements of traffic by every method
of transport from one end of the country to
the other.
Hon.

Mr. Macdonald:

Honourable

sena-

The Hon. the Speaker: I would remind
honourable senators that when the honourable senator who sponsored the bull speaks
he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The debate has been
very helpful; indeed, I think we ail now
have a reasonably good understanding of the
bill. A number of questions were asked of
me, most of which have been answered by
the remarks of the honourable senators
froma Inkermnan (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
In my opening remarks 1 said that this
bill was being brought forward as the best
solution that could be devised for the problem which fiows from. the decision of the
Privy Couneil. I quite agree with honourable
senators who have said that from time to
time changes, and perhaps drastic changes,
rnay have to be made i the legislation.
I think it was fixe honourabie senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) who mentioned the Trans-Canada highway.
My
recollection. of fixe provisions of the bill is
that traffic over it fails within the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. H-owever, I wouid remind the house that that
higlxway is flot yet completed. When it is
completed across the country it may be necessary to introduce new legisiation; but at the
present tinie most of the traffic flowing
between fihe provinces does not go over that
highway.
A question has been raised about the position o! the railways. I can only reply that
the railways will be in the same position
after the passage o! the bill as they have
83280-45J

been Up to the present time. The purpose
o! the bill is to restore to the provinces the
control of traffic, as it was prior to the judgment of the Privy Coundil.
In my opinion, although this legislation
may not be perfect, some measure is necessary. I would point out to those who suggest that the dominion government should.
inxmediately take over fixe control of al
interprovincial trafflc that it would cost fixe
country a very large suni of money. If, as
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) suggested, I did not speak
with great assurance when I introduced this
bill, I can say that I would have spoken with
much less assurance had I been put in fixe
position of having to ask this house to agree
to the setting up of another board of transport to control this type of traffic ail across
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We would not need
another board; we already have one.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At the same tinie,
may I say that in introducing this legislation,
I do so witx fixe greatest confidence because
I think it is fixe best that we can bring forward at this Umne. Certainly, no better solution for fixe probleni has been proposed. 1
therefore prcsent it to the house in the hope
that it wil receive favourable consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is it the wish of fixe
house that fixe bill be referred to the Standing Commnittee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I do not know what fixe
committee could do with a bull of this kind.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1 quite agree with the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
The language of the bill is quite clear, anci
I do flot see how we could learn anythxing
by referring it to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would suggest,
therefore, that the bill be read the third
time tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.

SECOND READING

Hon. William H. Taylor moved the second
reading of Bil 475, an Act to repeal fixe
National Physical Fitness Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Honourable senators, this
bull went tbrough ail its stages and was

SENATE
passed by the other house without debate,
and if this house is satisfied to give it similar
treatment, I am quite agreeable.
Briefly, the purpose of the bill is to repeal
the National Physical Fitness Act passed in
the 1943-44 session, and now known as Chapter 190 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1952. The reason the government is seeking
the repeal of the act is, I understand, that
it has not effectively carried out the purposes for which it was enacted. Section 1
of the bill, therefore, would repeal the act.
Section 2 provides that notwithstanding
the repeal of the act, agreements which have
been made with the provinces will continue
in force until March of next year. I have
before me some information with respect to
the extent to which these agreements have
been operative, but as I judge the temper
of the house I think I should not burden it
with that information.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will the honourable
senator tell us how many agreements are
oustanding?
Hon. Mr. Taylor: There are agreements
outstanding with all of the provinces, with
the exception of Newfoundland, Quebec and
the Yukon Territory. The agreement with
Prince Edward Island expired in 1952. The
amounts expended under the act since its
inception are not very large, but for the
information of the house I shall place on
ýour record a table of the payments made
under the act. I may say that the federal
government met the provincial contributions
dollar for dollar.
The table follows:

Hon. Mr. Haig: I will show my ignorance
by asking this question, but I will still ask
it: What did anyone do under this bill?
What was accomplished?
Hon. Mr. Taylor: The National Physical
Fitness Act set up a council to advise with
regard to physical fitness. The council was
composed of not less than three and not
more than ten persons, representatives of
physical fitness activities from each one of
the provinces that were interested or had
an agreement under the legislation. Does
that answer the question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I still do not know what
they did, and I would like to know that.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: The statute will tell you
that.
Section 4 of Chapter 190 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada reads as follows:
4. (1) It is the duty of the council to promote
the physical fitness of the people of Canada and in
the performance of such duty it may
(a) assist in the extension of physical education
in all educational and other establishments;
(b) encourage, develop and correlate all activities
relating te physical development of the people
through sports, athletics and other similar pursuits;
(c) train teachers, Iecturers and instructors in
the principles of physical education and physical
fitness ...

Does that give you the information you

and I recognize I talk a great deal-

Hou. Mr. Macdonald: No. no.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: At any rate, that remark
finds a responsive chord in one member in the
house. I have a little interest in this measure.
I happened to be a memiber of the government
at the time it was passed. Now, the honourable senator fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has given the one reason, the main
reason, why, at the time, it was considered
advisable to have a measure of this kind on
the statute books. Looking back now, I
should say it was conceived without a ful
consideration of ail its implications. It has
ceased to be effective, and now we are winding up its career. What will happen to the
office furniture and the office rent and the
director and the staff I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They will be kept on.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: At any rate, I can assure
the house that I am prepared to raise a
hearty cheer for this bihl that finalhy brings
an end to a measure which although well
intended at the time it was passed, in 1943,
might better have been ahlowed to fal
immediately into oblivion.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: 1 would like to ask a
question of the honourable senator Who sponsored the bihl before us. I notice from a
recent survey by health authorities that the
average Canadian is shorter and fatter than
he used to be. Did the National Fitness Act
have anything to do with that?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No; there was not
enough wheat.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Honourable senators, in
reply to my honourable friend's question I
would suggest that too much activity at the
table is responsible for the condition revealed

Hon. Mr. Reid: Might I ask one question?
Do I take it from the remarks of the honourable senator who sponsored this bill that certain agreements will remain in effect for some
time yet? If so, wihl any expenditures be
required to complete them, and will these be
made out of the appropriations of the Department of National Health and Welfare?
Hon. Mr. Taylor: I believe so. Under the
act thère is a provision that $232,000 will be
set aside each year to apphy to those provinces
with which agreements were made. The

contribution to a province was based on
the proportion of its population to that of the
whole dominion.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Taylor moved the third reading of
the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 478, an Act to amend the
Judges Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill. Its purpose is to provide
salaries for one addîtional judge for the
Court of Appeal in British Columbia and one
additional judge for the trial division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, the salary in each
case being $14,400.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is that an increase?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, there is no increase
involved here. As the house knows, the,
provinces have to determine how many judges
they need. British Columbia and Alberta
have each provided for an additional judgé
in their courts, and ahl that we are asked to
do is to vote the salaries for those two additional judges.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I suppose the population
of British Columbia is increasing to such an
extent that more judges are required there.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, and the samne
true of Alberta. I imagine the legal business
both of Alberta and British Columbia iS
increasing very considerably as a resuit of an
increase in population.

Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) asked a question, I supposed that he had this particular
subi ect in mmnd. As the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
'pointed out, the feeling expressed in relation to this matter at the meeting o! the
joint committee o! the Senate and« the House
of Commons was that inquiry' should be
made into the existing post office fadilities
and that a report should be made by a subcommittee of the Senate to the Internai
Economy Committee of this house. That subcommittee has already met and has asked
the Clerk of the House, in pursuance o! his
official functions, to go into this matter fully
with the Speaker o! the House o! Commons,
who has charge o! these matters i that
house; and I understand that instructions
have already been given by the Speaker o!
the House of Commons to the superintendent
of the post offices to make inquiries as to
available space in order to provide factual
data on this subject. But no move whatsoever has been made to consolidate the two
post offices, and it is certain that no such
move will be made without the consent o!
the Internai Economy Committee o! the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Wîll the committee then
report on the matter to the house?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: When the subcommittee has been acquainted with ail the facts it
will report to the main committee, which in
turn will report to the house. So there is no
chance i the world o! anything being done
about this matter, either academicaliy or
otherwise, before 'the next session.

MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORT BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved the third reading of Bil 474, an Act respecting extraprovincial motor vehicle transport.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, during the debate on the second reading of this
bil it was suggested by some honourable
mnembers that it be referred to a standing
committee for further study. However, after
due consideration, the house decided that
such action was unnecessary. I pointed out
during that debate that the bill contains two
saving or escape clauses, clauses 5 and 7,
under which the governinent retains power
to correct any situation remaining uncovered
because of inadequacies in the bil itself or
anomalies or inconsistencies in provincial
regulations, and so on. I arn sure that after
this bill has become law it will be rounded
out i due course, as experience dictates.
Having that i mind, I arn satisfied that
third reading be given.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Horner: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull
was read the third time, and passed, on
division.
VETERANS' LAND BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. W. RossMacdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 459, an act to amend the
Veterans' Land Act.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding to explain this bil, perhaps I should
mention that the bill received very careful
consideration by the House of Commons
before it came here. 'After it received second

SENATE
reading there it was referred to the Special
Committee on Veterans Affairs, which committee, as honourable senators know, consists
mainly, though not entirely, of veterans, and
is representative of all parties in the house.
The committee not only considered the bill
carefully, but went over it with the minister
and departmental officials. The bill then
received the unanimous approval of the
committee. I think it is unusual for a bill
affecting veterans to receive unanimous
approval, but this bill did, and when the
committee presented its report, the House of
Commons also passed the bill unanimously.
It is not my custom, as honourable senators know, to go over the clauses of a bill
one by one, but perhaps in this instance it
will be easier to explain the bill if I do so
to a certain extent. The bill divides the
Veterans' Land Act into three parts. Part I
comprises the whole of the present act from
section 6 on, as amended by this bill. Parts
II and III are additions to the act.
The amendments in Part I are largely
intended to overcome administrative difficulties that have been experienced by the
Veterans' Land Act administration over the
years. For instance, clause 2, with the marginal note "Determination of cost to director",
provides that the cost of the land and
improvements, so far as the director is concerned, is the amount actually expended
therefor by him, without taking into consideration the cost of any improvements that
may have been made on it by any other
department of the government.
Clause 3, while important, is relatively
unimportant in comparison with the other
clauses. It refers to veterans certified by
the director to be commercial fishermen and
is intended to cure certain deficiencies that
are mentioned in the explanatory note in the
bill.
May I next deal with subclause 3 of clause
3, which provides for the new subsection
(4a) of section 10 of the act. Honourable
senators of course appreciate that over the
years the veterans who have taken advantage
of the provisions of this act have a substantial equity in their holding. After a
period of ten years they get title to the land
and may sell it. It is felt, however, that it
would be unfair to allow the veteran, who
has had the advantage of the low interest
rate of 3k per cent, to sell the land to a
non-veteran who would indirectly benefit by
the provisions of the act. This new subsection is being inserted in the act to provide that upon the land being disposed of at
the end of ten years any remaining indebtedness against it will bear interest at 5 per
cent.

The act is not clear as to the right of
the director to return to a veteran who had
to give up his project any moneys that the
department received upon the sale of the
land in excess of what was owing at the time
the veteran gave it up. By clause 8 of the bill
provision is made that such a surplus will
be paid over to the veteran.
I think I have disposed of the important
points under Part I.
Generally speaking, Part II makes provision
for veterans who are building their own
homes. As honourable senators know, under
the National Housing Act a person who
wants a mortgage must have his plans
approved by an authorized lender before
money will be advanced on the project; and
the money is then advanced on the strength
of the proposed plans and the contract which
has been entered into for the building of the
house.
But under this bill, for the purpose of
assisting veterans who wish to build their
own houses, the director of the Veterans'
Land Act is to have at his disposal the
sum of $15 million, from which he can
advance moneys from time to time to such
veterans while their houses are being built.
It is a well-known fact that there are many
veterans who have had training in construction, and who either by themselves or with
the assistance of their friends can do a good
deal of work required in house building.
But a veteran cannot take advantage of this
provision merely by saying he wants to build
a bouse. He must satisfy the department
either that he is qualified to build the bouse
or that he bas arranged for satisfactory
supervision of its building. In fact, the
department will go so far as to give further
training to men who have some knowledge of
building.
When satisfactory arrangements
are made, the plans are drawn up, and the
building of the bouse will be carefully supervised by the department from time to time.
The veteran must have a financial interest
in the house to the extent of $800; and the
total amount that he can get under this
arrangement is $8,000. Upon the completion
of the house, the veteran will execute a
mortgage in favour of the Central Housing
and Mortgage Corporation.
Honourable senators may be curious to
know about interest charges on the money
advanced to the veteran while his house is
being built. No interest is charged during
that period of time, provided the veteran has
not been paid an allowance under the
Veterans Rehabilitation Act for the cost of
tuition at a university or other approved
institution. The legal work also will be done
by the department without charge to the

2. Your committee is aware of the continuing
interest being shown by various groups within this
country, as well as without, in achieving a freer
trade as contemplated by Article 2 of the North
Atlantic Treaty and the general desire, as expressed
by leaders in these member countries, that conflict
in international economic policies be avoided
wherever possible.
3. Your committee realizes that there are additional groups who wish to be heard and that time
has not permitted during the present sitting of parliament to accommodate aIl those who wish to
appear and present their views. For this reason,
it has not been possible to complete the findings
and submit a final report.
4. Your committee therefore expresses the hope
that at the earliest possible date during the next
session of parliament your committee may be
authorized to complete its work by hearing the
remaining witnesses who wish to appear and the
preparation of the final report. It is hoped that
from this report may emerge constructive ideas for
closer economic collaboration among the members
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST DAY
On the Orders of the Day:

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as this is Saint John the Baptist Day,
may I crave the indulgence of the house while
I make a few remarks in French.

JUNE 24, 1954
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
on the feast of St. John the Baptist, which
we are celebrating today, I wish to offer my
best wishes to all French-speaking Canadians
and to say to them that the history of French
Canada, from Cartier down to our own days,
may well inspire us with admiration.
In reading that history, from the times of
the pioneers who first broke the land to make
our task easier right down to the present
day, one finds that French-speaking Canadians have played a most important part in
building the Canadian nation and that they
have greatly contributed to strengthen our
national unity.
To all French-speaking Canadians and, in
particular, to those of you, honourable
senators, whose ancestors came from France,
I wish to express my very deep friendship.
(Text):
However, honourable senators, June 24 is
also a day of celebration in other parts of
our nation, for it was on that date in the
year 1497 that John Cabot, sailing under the
auspices of a group of English merchants,
moored his little ship the Mathew at Bonavista, in Newfoundland, and thereby discovered Canada. To the citizens of our
newest province, and its capital named for
this Saint, we send greetings and best wishes
on this memorable anniversary.
But yet another province, New Brunswick,
and its city of Saint John, also find this
feast day to be one of special significance.
Honourable members will recall that on the
occasion of Champlain's second visit to Canada, in 1604, he carried out, in association
with De Monts, extensive exploration in the
area round the Bay of Fundy prior to establishment of his early settlements at Port
Royal and St. Croix. Indeed, it was on the
24th of June, 1604, that his ship arrived in
the harbour at Saint John, which also
derives its name from this event. Today,
therefore, we also salute the people of Saint
John who this year will celebrate the three
hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of their city.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
may I first express my deepest gratitude to
my leader and friend, the Leader of the
Government, for having offered us, in French,
his best wishes on the feast of St. John the
Baptist. He has thereby given us a new
proof of the old ties of friendship between
the Scotch and the French, which I would
call even an affinity. I therefore thank the

Leader of the Government, in the name of
some four million Canadians of French
origin, in Quebec and the other provinces of
Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
also in the name of my Franco-American
brethren. The ancient French tradition of
courtesy requires that I should first offer my
best wishes to our youngest province, Newfoundland, which is today celebrating the
anniversary of its discovery, and the most
elementary politeness requires that I should
address myself in English to those who are
today commemorating the arrival of the
discoverer, John Cabot, at Bonavista, in 1497.
I will then continue my remarks in the
language of Shakespeare, as I wish to be
understood by all my colleagues, so that they
may express their approval or disapproval
of my statements.
(Text):
Honourable senators, it is St. John's Day
for our good friends from Newfoundland as
well as for us, and to them I offer with all
my heart my very best and kindest wishes.
We are all exceedingly happy to have been,
shall I say, annexed a few years ago by
that island which was long known as
Britain's oldest colony. I trust that this
union, so long desired, will prove to be a
profitable association for Newfoundlanders
as well as for all other Canadians.
During my youth I spent three summers
on the banks and in the waters of the Strait
of Belle Isle. I had the privilege of spending two weeks at the northernmost point in
Newfoundland, at a small island whose name
is pronounced in English "Kirpoon". The
little island was in fact named Querpont, a
good old Breton name, by our own Jacques
Cartier. I also visited Blanc Sablon, on the
north shore of Labrador, which was also
christened by the ancient mariner from St..
Malo.
For centuries fishermen from Brittany, thenative land of my ancestors, have come to.

about five thousand French-speaking Newfoundlanders. To them and to all Frenchspeaking Canadians in Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island I
extend my good wishes. I know, of course,
that the majority of French-speaking Maritimers belong to the heroic Acadian branch
of our family and that they celebrate their
Feast on Assumption Day, August 15. But
I cannot forget today those brothers and
sisters numbering a quarter of a million on
the Atlantic coast.

we remember first our intrepid discoverers:
Cartier, Champlain, La Salle, Marquette,
D'Iberville, La Vérendrye. We have a pious
thought for our missionaries and for our
martyrs. Today, we glorify such military
heroes as Dollard, Frontenac, Montcalm,
Lévis, de Salaberry; those also of the Royal
22nd-the "Van-Doos"-and of the Chaudiere, of our Mount Royal Fusiliers and of
all our regiments, without forgetting of
course our glorious Alouette squadron, and
all those who served with such courage and
distinction in our Air Force and our Navy.
We remember also with pride our political
leaders of the past: Bédard, Bourdages,
Papineau, Lafontaine, Cartier, Dorion, Mercier, Laurier, Lapointe, Cardin, and, I hope,
also Gouin and Taschereau.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I now turn to the half
million Franco-Ontarians who have given to
us such statesmen, among others, as my
excellent friends the Honourable Paul Martin
and the Honourable Lionel Chevrier. I pass
on to Manitoba, the province of the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and of our
devoted Chief Government Whip, the honourable senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), whose home town of Saint Jean
Baptiste bears the name of our patron saint.
To our 50,000 or more Franco-Manitobans;
to our beloved 40,000 or more "Saskatons",

Franco-Albertans of Edmonton and elsewhere
in Alberta; and to our 25,000 Frenchspeaking compatriots of British Columbia, I

our patron saint. President Eisenhower was
invited to participate in their celebrations,
but his many commitments prevented him
from being present. However, he expressed
his regrets in a letter that was so kind and
had such a personal touch that all French
Canadians have read it with satisfaction and
are grateful to the President for that gesture.
Honourable senators, before resuming my
place I ask the question: What does the
future hold in store for all Canadians, and in
particular for Canadians of French origin like
myself? Without hesitation, I answer that we
believe in Canada, we hope for its continuous progress, we love our beloved country with all our hearts. "It is great indeed
to be a Canadian", to quote our Prime Minister and world-famous leader, Mr. St.

Laurent. I wish to remark here on this
solemn occasion that the declaration which
he made yesterday about the possibility of
holding a federal-provincial conference next
fall, as bas been suggested by Premier Frost,
has greatly rejoiced my heart. I commend
our distinguished Prime Minister for always
keeping a light in the window. He has made
it quite clear that he is willing to hold discussions with any provincial premier, and
that he is convinced that a fair and just
solution can be found for the difficulties
which now confront, in particular, my own
province.
Although I am a political opponent-and,
I would say, even a stubborn political opponent-of Premier Duplessis, it is for me a
pleasant duty to offer him today my compliments in his capacity as the official chief of
my province. I was a fellow student of the
Maurice Duplessis in law
Honourable
school-for, incidentally, I may say that there
was a time when the senator from De Salaberry was a young law student. Ever since
those early days in our careers I have constantly, and, I would say, most faithfu-lly,
opposed him in politics, but nevertheless I
owe a great debt of personal gratitude to him.
When I lost my mother, in 1904, the wife of
the Honourable Honoré Mercier II became
my foster mother and, in later years when
that dear aunt of mine lost her husband and
found herself in a state of great financial
distress, Premier Duplessis secured the adoption by the Quebec legislature of an act
granting her a pension. I cannot forget that
noble gesture of generosity on the part of
the Premier of Quebec, and I am glad to
record today in Hansard that deed which
does so much credit and honour to him.
May I ask all my political friends from
Quebec, including my illustrious leader, Mr.
St. Laurent, and all my political opponents,
including that benefactor of my family,
Premier Duplessis, not to forget the words of
Honoré Mercier I: Cessons nos luttes fratricides. Unissons-nous-"Let us cease our
fratricidal strife. Let us unite".
For statesmen of good will, for two Canadian leaders deeply attached to our country
as a whole and loving like a mother their
own native province, surely a fair and just
settlement is possible. The sooner steps are
taken to solve an urgent and vital issue, the
better it will be for Our common welfare.
May our great patron saint obtain for me
the grace not to have spoken in vain today,
not ta have preached in the wilderness.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

APPENDIX
(Referred to at page 716)
Evidence of
W. J. Bennett, President of Atomie Energy of Canada Limited,
before the Standing Committee of the Senate on Banking and
Commerce, June 24, 1954.
It has been suggested that I should describe
for the committee the atomic energy program.
I think it may be helpful to an understanding
of our present program if I recall very
briefly Canada's introduction to atomic
energy and the part that we played in that
remarkable achievement-the atomic bomb.
Sir Winston Churchill has described in the
fourth volume of his memoirs his meeting
with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park in
June of 1942, and the momentous decision
which was taken at that meeting-that the
United States would try to produce an atomic
bomb. Canada was a partner in this great
enterprise almost from its inception. We
supplied uranium-the raw material of the
bomb-from the deposits at Port Radium in
In association
the Northwest Territories.
with a group of British scientists, we undertook to develop a method for producing
plutonium, the fissionable substance needed
for atomic bombs. It was the success of this
project, known as the "Montreal Laboratory",
which made possible the design and construction of the NRX reactor at Chalk River
under the direction of the National Research
Council, the most efficient reactor of its kind
in the world.
The program undertaken in Canada during
the war, both in the raw materials field and
in the field of reactor design and development, have determined the character of our
postwar program. Before describing that
program, I will mention briefly the several
agencies which have been concerned with it,
and their respective duties. These are the
Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada,
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, and
Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited.
The Atomic Energy Control Board, established on August 31, 1946, is primarily an
advisory agency which deals with questions
The board is also
of national policy.
responsible for establishing and administering the various regulations which are necessary at this time in the field of atomic
energy.

Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is a
crown company which was incorporated in
April 1, 1952, to take over the direction of
the Chalk River project from the National
Research Council.
Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited,
also a crown company, came into existence
in January, 1944, as the successor to the
privately-owned company which operated a
mine at Port Radium in the Northwest
Territories and a refinery at Port Hope,
Ontario. This company is responsible for the
raw materials program. The company has
a dual role. It is a producer of uranium and
the procurement agent for all uranium mined
in Canada.
This distribution of functions as between
the three agencies, which I have just
described, was an attempt to reconcile the
administrative realities which emerged from
the war with what were considered to be the
administrative requirements of the postwar
program. It was anticipated that as the
program developed, some revision of the
administrative set-up might become necessary. This has proved to be the case. The
purpose of the proposed amendments to the
Atomic Energy Control Act of 1946 is to
establish administrative machinery and procedures which will better meet the requirements of the present and future program.
First, a few words about the raw materials
program. You will recall that in 1946 and
1947 a - serious attempt was made by the
United Nations Atomic Energy Commission
to establish some method of controlling
atomic energy, in the hope that the horrors
of an atomic war might be prevented. In
these days when there is criticism in some
quarters of the moral leadership of the United
States, we do well to remember the proposals submitted by the United States to the
United Nations Atomic Energy Connission
in 1946. In brief, the United States was
prepared to hand over to an international
agency all of its stock of atomic bombs, all
of its scientific data, and all of its raw

SENATE
material, on condition only that other nations
would do likewise, and that there would be
an effective international inspection. If we
consider the very advanced position of the
United States in atomic energy at the time in
relation to other countries, we will appreciate
the generosity of this offer. The refusal of
the U.S.S.R. and its satellites to accept the
offer may well be one of the fateful decisions of history. Certainly, had the offer been
accepted, we would be living in a different
world today. The failure to reach agreement
could have only one result-the United States
decided to expand the atomic bomb program.
The Government of Canada, in its turn,
decided that the wartime partnership should
be continued. These decisions were based on
the conviction which surely needs no argument, that the atomic bomb is the most potent
means of maintaining the security of the
western world.
In terms of raw materials the decisions
meant that we would not only continue to
supply uranium for the bomb from our
existing sources, but that we would make a
vigorous attempt to find new sources.
What success have we had with the first of
these objectives?
The Eldorado Mine at Port Radium faced
two problems at the end of the war-depleted
ore reserves and an inadequate ore dressing
process. The fact that the mine is still
operating and that the company was able to
increase production by approximately 75
per cent in 1952 will indicate the measure of
our success in solving these problems.
What have we done about finding new
sources of production?
I will speak first of Eldorado's exploration
activity. The program got into full stride in
1947. Late in that year a large number
of radioactive occurrences were discovered
and staked in the vicinity of Beaverlodge
Lake in northwestern Saskatchewan. After
extensive diamond drilling in 1948, two of
these occurrences were selected for underground exploration. This began in 1949, and
was carried through 1950 and 1951. One of
the occurrences located on the St. Louis
Fault, and known as the Ace, proved to be a
mine. The construction of a mining plant
and a concentrator was started in April of
1952. The plants were in operation in May
of 1953-a little more than a year later. The
Ace mine is now in full production. When
I tell you that the property is located 300
miles from railhead and is inaccessible except
by air for eight months of the year, you will
appreciate the significance of this achievement. Initial production is at the rate of
500 tons of ore per day, but the mining plant
was designed to handle 2,000 tons per day,

attesting our optimism as to the ore potentialities of the ground along the St. Louis
Fault. As a further indication of that
optimism, we have just begun to sink a third
exploration shaft, a mile and a half east of
the Ace ore body. We are hopeful that this
will lead to a substantial increase in tonnage.
What of the activities of other mining
companies?
As I have mentioned previously, the decision
to expand the bomb program brought with
it the demand for more uranium. To those
of us who were responsible for the raw
materials program, it seemed clear that we
could only hope to meet this new demand by
encouraging the prospector and the industry
to join in the search for uranium. As a first
step in implementing such a policy, the
reservation of title to the crown of radioactive minerals, which was established during
the war years, was removed. A second and
third step were necessary-the establishment
of a purchasing policy, and the selection of a
procurement agent. An advisory committee,
drawn in large part from the mining industry,
was set up to advise on purchasing policy.
It was the committee's view that there was
no hope of interesting the prospector and
the mining industry unless a reasonable incentive could be provided. Since under existing international conditions there could be
no question of an open market, with the free
play of price which this involves, it was
the committee's recommendation that the
incentive should take the form of a guaranteed minimum price for a fixed period. The
first price was published in March, 1948, and
was guaranteed for five years. Both the
price and the period of the guarantee have
been revised from time to time on the recommendation of the advisory committee. The
present price has been guaranteed until
March 31, 1962. Granted the continuing need
for a close control of the sale and export
of radioactive materials, it appeared that this
could best be obtained by channelling all
sales and exports through a single agency.
Eldorado was designated as that agency.
Availability as well as experience in the sales
field were the principal reasons which
prompted the selection. What success have we
had in attracting the interest of the prospector and the mining industry?
I can best answer this question by indicating some of the conditions which tend to
discourage investment in uranium exploration.
First, there is the very understandable
concern as to the future of uranium when
the military need decreases or ceases altogether. While the future is beginning to take
shape, it is not possible at this time to estimate accurately the post-military demand for
uranium. The guarantee of a minimum price

JUNE 24, 1954
for a fixed period seems to offer the only
solution to this problem, pending the day
when it will be possible to forecast the longterm demand. The present price has been
guaranteed until March 1962. Bearing in
mind the fluctuations of price which affect
other base metals, the guarantee does provide some compensation for the disabilities
associated with a single market.
Second, there has been some dissatisfaction
with the price offered. Under normal marketing conditions, there is a world price for
metals which is determined largely by
demand. But we are not dealing with a
normal situation. The fact that the bulk of
the uranium production in the free world is
now being used in the atomic bomb program
means simply that there is a single buyerthe United States Atomic Energy Commission.
So long as this condition prevails, the establishment of price will rest finally with the commission. While as a producer I can understand
the demand for a higher price, I believe I also
have some appreciation of the problem which
the commission faces in its attempt to work
out satisfactory prices for producers in the
United States and producers in other countries.
Here I should point out that Canada is only
one of several countries now supplying
uranium for the bomb program. If we admit,
as I think we must, that our partnership with
the United States in that program is in the
national interest, it follows that in establishing a purchasing policy we must endeavour
to equate our responsibility as a partner with
the reasonable needs of the Canadian producer. We have tried to do this by adopting
a policy midway between the practice which
prevails under normal commercial conditions
-where price is dictated by demand, and the
practice which prevails under conditions of
wartime buying-where price is usually arrived at by negotiation and is related to cost.
There is a fixed price which is available to all
producers, but we have also said that we
will consider the payment of special prices
where conditions warrant such consideration.
Such special prices will be arrived at by
negotiation and will be related to cost.
What conditions might warrant the payment of a special price? One example would
be the case of a property with a proven tonnage of substantial size but which, because
of grade or location, could not produce under
Another
the published price schedule.
would be the case of a property which was
able to produce a high-grade mill product
but only after large expenditures for the
plant and its operation.
concentration
Several special price contracts have now
been negotiated and several are under
consideration.

Finally, and I regard this as much the
most serious of the deterrents to investment,
there was in Canada until recently a growing conviction that it was going to be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to discover
a uranium property of commercial worth. I
have been one of those who have argued
since the inception of the purchasing policy
that no amount of financial incentive would
take the place of one good discovery. Following the establishment of the purchasing
policy in the spring of 1948, considerable
interest was shown by the prospector and
the mining industry. This slackened off
very noticeably in the succeeding years; not,
in my view, because the price was unattractive, but because no private company had
made a real find. The discovery late in 1952
by a private company of a second major
property in the Beaverlodge area has brought
about a decided change in the Canadian picture. More recently important discoveries
have been made in the Blind River area of
Ontario. Two properties in this area are
now planning production.
I am quite aware that I have not answered
the all-important question-what will happen when the bomb program is cut back or
discontinued? The answer to that question
is bound up with the future of atomic energy
in the civilian economy. I hope that the
remarks which I shall now make on that
subject may serve to put the problem in
better perspective, even if they do not provide a final answer.
This brings me to a description of the
second phase of the Canadian program-the
research and development establishment at
Chalk River.
At the present time the civilian application
of atomic energy can be considered under
and
two general headings-radioisotopes
power. The NRX reactor at Chalk River,
and the new NRU reactor now under construction, have this in common with all
reactors: they release energy from nuclear
reactions and provide a powerful source of
neutrons which can be used to produce
radioisotopes and nuclear fuel.
I will speak first of the radioisotope program, since this is the most advanced in
terms of application. Radioisotopes are produced in two ways-by irradiating certain
materials in a reactor, or by extraction from
the large quantities of fission products which
are released by a reactor. The fact that the
NRX reactor has the highest known neutron
flux of any natural uranium reactor in the
world has made it possible for Canada to
produce radioactive isotopes which are difficult, or impossible, to produce in other reactors. A great many of these isotopes are

SENATE
now available, and the number is increasing.
Possibly the best known is Cobalt 60, because
of its use in the treatment of cancer. Canada
was able to pioneer this development, since
Cobalt 60 produced in the Chalk River reactor
has special properties not contained in Cobalt
60 produced elsewhere. Deep therapy units,
as they are called, designed and produced in
Canada by the Commercial Products Division
of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, are
now in use in Canada, the United States, the
United Kingdom and Italy. Radio-iodine,
radio-phosphorus, radio-gold, radio-carbon,
and numerous labelled organic compounds
and hormones are also being produced at
Chalk River for medical research and treatment. Isotopes have found a use in certain
industrial processes. They are used to control thicknesses of paper and metallic films,
for eliminating electro-static charges in
printing machines and textile mills, for locating junctures of oil supplies in pipelines, for
indicating liquid levels in tanks, to mention
a few of their common applications. The
use of radioisotopes as tracers in certain
chemical, physiological, and agricultural processes opens up a wide field of application.
For example, with a radioisotope used as a
tracer, it is possible to follow the life history
of an insect, the motion of sap and absorption
of salts by the roots of plants, the efficiency
of phosphate fertilizers, and the amount of
retention of certain elements in the food fed
to animals. Since the production of isotopes
presents no great technical difficulty, the
extension of their use is now largely a problem in applied research-a problem which,
in my opinion, can best be solved through the
active interest of the potential user-industry
and the medical profession. It will be our
policy to continue to encourage this interest.
What do we mean by atomic power? It is
customary to begin the answer to this question by expressing the energy potential of
uranium in terms of kilowatt hours of energy.
It is estimated that the fission of one pound
of uranium 235 releases in a reactor 11,400,000
kilowatt hours of energy. While this gives us
some measure of the tremendous energy
potential which is possible in a reactor, it
must be interpreted in the light of a further
fact: There is no known method of making
a direct conversion of this energy to electric
energy. However, the fission process does
produce very great heat. It is estimated that
the heat given off as a result of the fission of
one pound of uranium 235 is equivalent to
that obtained from burning 1,300 tons of
coal. It is this heat which is the key to the
use of atomic energy as a source of electric

power. Atomic energy does not provide a
new kind of power. It simply provides a
new kind of fuel for the standard power
plant. As such it is in the same category as
the other thermal sources such as coal, oil and
natural gas.
The importance of this atomic fuel as a
source of power will depend on the cost of
producing it, translated into cost per kilowatt
hour of electrie energy generated. In one
sense the problem might be said to be economic, rather than technical, since we have
already demonstrated that it is possible to
design and operate a reactor which produces
heat. In fact the technical and economic factors are inseparable. All of the reactors now
in existence were costly to build and are
expensive to operate. Most of them were
designed to produce plutonium for the military program. Now if there was a continuing
market for plutonium it would be possible to
treat the heat as a by-product, and thus produce low-cost power. There are two objections to this approach. First, there is some
evidence that a reactor designed primarily
for the production of plutonium would not
have the most desirable characteristics as a
producer of heat for the generation of power.
Second, it would be unwise to assume that the
military demand for plutonium will continue
at the present level for an indefinite period.
A cut-back in demand, or a cessation of
demand, would throw the full cost of the
reactor and its operation against the production of heat, with a resulting cost per kilowatt
hour which would be prohibitive. Therefore, we must find a way of designing a reactor which can be made self-sustainingeconomically speaking-as a producer of heat.
This is a job which requires great genius in
fundamental and applied research, and great
skill in design and engineering. It is this job
which we are trying to do at Chalk River.
You have probably gathered from the literature already published on atomie power that
there are several designs of reactors now
being investigated. Broadly speaking, there
are two types: reactors which use natural
uranium as a fuel-called slow reactors; and
reactors which use fissionable material, such
as plutonium, as a fuel-called fast reactors.
Both have their advantages and it is probable that both will be used. One of the
important factors in the choice of design may
well be the availability of an abundant and
continuing supply of cheap uranium. The
NRX reactor now in operation at Chalk River
is a slow reactor, that is, it uses natural uranium as a fuel. The NRU reactor now under
construction is of a similar type but much
more advanced in design. While the new

JUNE 24, 1954
reactor will afford ample opportunity for
carrying out the fundamental research which
is necessary for the design of a power reactor,
it is not itself a power reactor.
The next stage in the program must be
the design and engineering of a power reactor. Since this will involve problems in
engineering, as well as problems in research,
it seemed obvious that the time had come to
bring into the picture as active partners, those
who will be the ultimate users of atomic
power, and those who will be asked to supply
the equipment for atomic power plants.
As a first step in this direction, a number
of power companies and certain firms engaged
in the manufacture of power equipment
joined with the staff at Chalk River in a
symposium on atomie power. Some of the
papers presented at that symposium have
now been published.
Following this meeting an invitation was
extended to all the provincial power commissions and to the private power companies to
participate in the study of atomic power now
under way at Chalk River. In November of
1953 arrangements were entered into with
the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario for the carrying out of an atomic
power feasibility study. The purpose of this
study is to decide upon an outline specification for a power reactor and to prepare an
estimate of its cost. A special group has been
selected for the study, drawn in part from
the Chalk River organization and in part from
the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario. The staff in certain specialized
fields, such as chemical processing and metallurgy, will be recruited from industry.
In order to bring about a fuller participation in the program of the provincial power
commissions and private power companies,
an advisory committee on atomic power has
been established on which these commissions
and companies will be represented. The
purpose of the committee will be to acquaint
the potential users of atomic power with the
progress of the research and development
program at Chalk River. It is expected that
the members of the committee will assist in
the assessment of the economics of this new
source of electrical energy.
I mentioned a moment ago that the problems involved in the use of atomic energy
as a source of electric power were both technical and economic, and I commented briefly
on the direct relationship between the two.
There is an even broader economic implication. When we say that our objective is to
reduce the capital and operating cost of
reactors to the point where nuclear fuel can
compete with other fuels as a source of

power, you will naturally conclude that we
must be using some cost yardstick. This
is so. The yardstick is a maximum cost
which will be comparable to the cost of
producing power in a steam plant with coal
at $8 per ton. This we estimate roughly
between 5 and 6 mills per kilowatt hour. Now
at first glance this figure may appear prohibitive bearing in mind the prevailing rates
for hydro power. This is true only if we
expect to have an unlimited supply of hydro
power which can be developed and transmitted to existing industrial areas at low cost.
What do we know about the probable
future power demand and the resources
which will be available to meet that demand?
Here we enter upon the realm of speculation, and I would ask you to keep this in
mind in judging the validity of my conclusions. What has happened in the past is
probably the best guide to what may be
expected to happen in the future. Let us,
therefore, take a look at the past. Let us
see what has happened in the past twentyfive years. We find that in that period the
consumption of electricity in Canada has
increased four-fold, the total dollar value of
our production of goods and services has
doubled, and our population has increased
by about 50 per cent. It is not too difficult
to trace a relationship between these three
factors. Amongst other things, this relationship justifies the conclusion that Canada's
remarkable expansion during the past
twenty-five years has been due in some measure to the availability of abundant and cheap
power. It also supports the argument that if
this expansion is to continue we must expect
a continuing rise in power consumption. Or
to put it another way-the availability of
power will be a condition of our growth in
the future, as it has been a condition of our
growth in the past.
Suppose we now attempt to project the
power demand over the next twenty-five
years. For the purposes of this projection
we will assume that our population will
increase at the rate of approximately two
per cent per annum, something less than the
average rate of increase over the past twentyfive years, and that the gross value of our
national output will increase at the rate of
3j per cent per annum, which is also somewhat less than the average rate of increase
over the past twenty-five years. Let us assume
that the relationship of population and
national output to power demand which has
existed during the past twenty-five years will
also prevail during the next twenty-five
years. On this basis Canada's power requirements will quadruple by 1979. In place of the

SENATE
10,000,000 kilowatts of installed capacity which
we have today we will need an installed
capacity of somewhere around 40,000,000 kilowatts by 1979. Even if we use a somewhat
different approach, and merely assume that
our present annual increment in the order
of 1,000,000 kilowatts continues to hold over
the next twenty-five years, we corne up with
much the same result. Adding this 25,000,000
kilowatts to our present installed capacity
of 10,000,000 kilowatts gives us a figure in
the order of 35,000,000 kilowatts by 1979.
Where is this power to corne from?
The total hydro potential is estimated to
be 50,000,000 kilowatts. Of this we are now
using approximately 20 per cent. However,
when we consider these figures we must
keep in mind that the 20 per cent is a
national average. The amount of that potential now in use in some areas is much higher
than 20 per cent. Moreover, substantial
blocks of this potential power are located
in areas not readly accessible to industry. It
is possible, of course, that certain industries
which use large amounts of power, such as
aluminum, will be prepared to establish
plants at or near the site of the power, as is
happening at Kitimat. However, in most
industrial operations power, while it is
essential, is not a large element of cost.
Consequently, these industries are likely to
give more weight to such items as the cost
of transportation, availability of labour and
housing, etc., when they are selecting plant
locations. This being so, I do not think it
would be wise to conclude that our total
estimated potential hydro power will be
available for existing industrial areas. The
experts whom I have consulted tell me that
of the total estimated hydro potential of
50,000,000 kilowatts, 30,000,000 kilowatts are
likely to be available for use in existing
industrial areas by 1979. On this basis we
can anticipate a hydro power deficiency of
somewhere between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000
kilowatts twenty-five years from now. We
will have to meet this deficiency from thermal sources. If conventional fuel-burning
plants are to be used, these plants will have
to provide generating capacity equivalent to
between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of our
present generating capacity, depending on
whether we estimate the hydro deficiency at
5,000,000 or 10,000,000 kilowatts. This would
mean a four-fold and possibly an eight-fold
increase in our present steam plant capacity.
Obviously, any assessment of the cost of
existing thermal sources in terms of the Canadian power picture as a whole is complicated
by the fact that in some regions coal or oil,

or natural gas, or all three, are available in
substantial quantities and at low cost;
whereas in other regions there are no indigenous thermal fuels. It so happens that
one of the areas which has experienced the
greatest increase in power demand-southern
Ontario-is in the second category. Here
our appraisal of the future power demand,
and the sources from which that demand
can be met, can be made with a greater
degree of certainty.
The average increase in the primary power
requirements for the southern Ontario system
in the years from 1922 to 1952 has been 5-7
per cent per annum. To put the position
more graphically, the total power requirements have increased from 498,000 kilowatts
in 1922 to 2,766,000 kilowatts in 1952. If we
apply the rule that a 6 per cent increase per
annum will require the doubling of a power
system every twelve years, and if we assume
that the present average rate of increase will
continue, we can estimate that the capacity
for the southern Ontario system will have to
be doubled over the next twelve years and
quadrupled over the next twenty-four years.
What are the prospects of obtaining additional power from water resources in Ontario?
Present estimates indicate that the water
resources of the southern Ontario system in
1958 will be insufficient to meet the demand
unless the St. Lawrence development goes
ahead. Even with the development of the
St. Lawrence, water resources will again be
insufficient by 1962. It seems obvious that if
the power demand is to increase at the estimated rate, the additional power required
will have to come from thermal sources.
None of these thermal sources is found in
Ontario. They must be imported or brought
from great distances within Canada. There
seems to be no likelihood that the cost of
these thermal fuels, or the cost of transporting them, will decrease. The trend is now
in the other direction. Under such conditions
we believe that atomic power can make a
very important contribution to the power
resources of Ontario.
I have used the situation in southern
Ontario to give emphasis to my argument.
Where comparable conditions prevail in other
regions, atomic energy should also fill the
gap.
I hope that there will have emerged from
my remarks, necessarily sketchy, some understanding of what we are doing about atomic
energy in Canada. I hope it will also be
clear that the program has two parts. The
immediate end of the raw materials part of

lUNE 24, 1954
the program is to increase the supply of
uranium for use in atomic bombs. We may
regret the need for such a priority, but I
think we can take some comfort from the
knowledge that in striving for this end we
may well obtain information about our
uranium potential which we would not otherwise obtain. In a sense, therefore, the raw
materials effort also has a long-term objective.
The primary end of the program at Chalk
River is to maintain and improve our

technology in reactor design and operation,
in order that we may be able to, take full
advantage of our uranium resources when
the civilian application of atomic energy becornes possible. There is no conflict, between
these ends. The one is necessary to the
other. If we are to, hold the unique position
we have now gained in atomic energy, we
must have both an ample supply of its raw
material and the techniques so necessary for
its application.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
FIRST PEEAÉDING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 479, an Act for granting to Her Mai esty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 3lst March, 1955.
The bill was read the flrst time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the. Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I move the second reading now.
Honourable senators, this bill is the f ourth
of the supply bills which have corne before
us during this session. Appropriation Bill
No. 1, which was passed on March 31 hast,
covered interim supply for the first part of
the fiscal year beginnir.g April 1, 1954, and
ending March 31, 1955. It consisted of onesixth of the items to be voted in the main
estimates for the fiscal year, and in addition
it included proportional expenditures on
certain items, of which the major portion was
to be expended earlier in the year. The bill
provided interim supply in the amount of
$530,945,824.41.
Honourable senators will recall that Appropriation Bull No. 2, which was passed on
March 31 last, covered the end-of-the-year
supplementary estimates for the fiscal year
1953-54, in the amount of $98,214,350.
Appropriation Bill No. 3, which was passed
on May 27 last, granted interim supply for
the month o! June, plus additional proportions of certain special items, and was in the
amount of $264,417,542.92.
The fourth and final appropriation bil, now
before us, asks for a total amount o! $2,402,This amount consists of the
747,102.67.
balance of the main estimates remaining
unappropriated at the present time, in the
amount of $2,360,432,364.67, together with a
sum of $42,314,738 provided for in the further
supplementary estimates tabled in the House
of Commons. It will be realized that to these
amounts appropriated by parliament must be
added a sum of $1,739,721,393, which is the
amount authorized by statute, bringing the
total of the expenditures authorized this
session to $4,937,831,863.

SENATE
The form of the bill follows in all respects
that of the main supply bill which comes to
us at the end of every session. Perhaps
I may be permitted to refer to the bill by
sections.
Section 1 is simply the short title.
Section 2 provides for the balance of the
main estimates after deducting the amounts
appropriated under the Appropriation Acts
Nos. 1 and 3 passed earlier this year, and
as I have already mentioned, amounts to
$2,360,432,364.67. Details of this item will be
found in Schedule A attached to the bill.
Section 3 provides for further supplementary estimates for the fiscal year 1954-55 and
which, as I mentioned a few moments ago,
amount to $42,314,738. The details of this
amount are to be found in Schedule B
attached to the bill.
I do not intend to mention many of the
items. Among the major amounts to be
found in this section are a $6 million item
towards the construction of Public Works
projects, both of public buildings and of river
and harbour installations, as well as expenditures incurred by Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation in the construction of
married personnel quarters and schools for
the Department of National Defence. There
is a one and one half million dollar pension
benefit program for the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, a $900,000 expenditure for
harbour construction at Halifax and Saint
John, a $9 million item for the restoration
of a special account in the consolidated
revenue fund established by section 36 of the
National Housing Act, 1954, by the amount
paid out of the special account in respect of
housing and land development projects undertaken jointly with the governments of the
provinces during the fiscal year 1953-54.
There is also a $1 million item for advances
to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, under section 37 of the new National
Housing Act in respect of housing projects
for veterans, as well as at Gander, Newfoundland, and at Pembroke for the
employees of the Atomic Energy of Canada.
Another major item is a three and onehalf million dollar sum by way of a loan to
the Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited, on such terms and conditions as the governor in council may approve,
for the redemption of Canadian National
Steamships government-guaranteed
bonds
issued on March 1, 1930, and maturing on
March 1, 1955.
The last major item is one of over $5
million for the purchase of land and improvements; the cost of permanent improvements
to be effected; the removal of encumbrances;
stock and equipment; and for the protection

of security under the Veterans Land Act.
Details of the items listed in these further
supplementary amounts may be found in
Schedule B of the act.
Section 4 of the bill is the usual authorization for the governor in council to raise by
way of loan a sum not exceeding $500 million
which may be required from time to time
throughout the year.
Section 5 provides that the usual accounts
be submitted in detail to the House of Commons in conformity with the Financial
Administration Act.
Honourable members will appreciate that
the bill is in the usual form of the supply
bill which reaches us at the end of the
session, and I submit it to the 'house for its
favourable consideration. It is unfortunate,
I agree, that there is not time to study the
details of the expenditures found in the
schedules. But, while I regret that there has
not been more time at our disposal for this
purpose, I would remind honourable members that the estimates have been in our
possession for many months; we have had
the opportunity of seeing the estimates of
every department, and also of following the
debates in the House of Commons. So I think
that we can fairly say we are familiar with
the items in the main estimates; and I have
given details of the major items in the further
supplementary estimates.
For these reasons the bill before us is not
completely new, and I commend it to the
house for approval at this time.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
a long and more or less dreary session of
parliament is rapidly coming to a close. In
the absence of the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) I had intended
to make a quite comprehensive speech relating not only to the estimates but to several
other items, such as the conservation of our
natural resources. But upon consultation
with my colleagues on this side of the
chamberHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -I
have decided to
postpone making that speech until the next
session of parliament. Perhaps I shall do so
during the debate on the next Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Honourable senators, this being a budget
debate it is quite in order for members to
speak on any subject they may choose. I
should like to make a few remarks at this
time about the Delorme divorce petition,
which has been killed for the present session.

JUNE 28. 1954
Honou.rabie senators know that for many
years I was Chairman of the Standing
Cornittee on DivorceHon. Mr. Macdonald: And an excellent
chairman.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Assumie: But this year, owing to
a serious accident to my Leader (Hon. Mr.
Haig), which resulted in added responsibilities
for myseif, I was forced to give Up the post
of -chairman. Together with other honourable
menibers I was able ta persuade the honourable gentleman from. Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) to take over as chairman, but
I aflowed my name to rernain among the list
of members ini order that I might give assistance frorn tirne to time, if necessary, and on
several occasions when the chairman was
unabie to be present I acted in his place. I
arn sure that if the chairman were here now
he wouid speak briefiy about this divorce
petition, s0 I arn taking the liberty of making
a few rernarks in his absence.
The petition in the Delorme case was
deait with in the usuai way, and evidence
on behalf of both the petitioner and the
respondent was carefully considered by our
Divorce Committee during a lengthy hearing.
Finaliy the members of the committee
unanimousiy agreed to recornmend the
granting of the petition, and reported to, the
Senate accordingly. A bill dissoiving the
marriage was subsequentiy passed and sent
to the House of Commons for approvai. I
do not want my remarks to be considered as
a criticisrn of what happened in the other
place. As I understand it, the bill eventualiy
received second reading there, but when it
came up for third reading it was referred
back ta the Misceilaneous Private Bills Committee for further consideration. That cornmittee then recalied many of the witnesses
for bath the petitianer and respondent, and
finally decided in f avour of the bill, and s0
reparted ta the House of Commons. However, two or three days ago when the bill
came up for third reading in that houseI arn basing my statement on a report that
appeared in the Ottawa Citizen-the bill was
kiiled for this session. It seems that certain
members took up the fuli hour allotted for
private bills, and as parliament is proroguing
today the bill cannot be further deait with
at this session.
I do not like that procedure, and I think
something should be done so that a case of
this kind couid not die in that manner. The
petitioner Delorme was entitied ta a decision
one way or the other. The Senate Divorce
Comrnittee may have been wrong in its
decision, or the cornmittee in the other place

may have been wrong; but this man having
paid his money and presented his case, it
was the duty of parliarnent ta consider bis
petition and decide one way or the other on

should have been given either for or against
him.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Asefline: In my opinion, what
has happened ini this case is a travesty of
justice. That is ail I wish ta say about this
divorce petition. I hape that some change
in the rules can be made sa that such a thing
will not; happen again. A divorce bill is
different frorn a private member's bull, for
a private member does not pay a parliamentary fee as a petitioner for divorce does. A
private member's bill may be acceipted or
rejected or taiked out. It seems to me, hawever, that a divorce bill shouid flot be talked
out, but that a decision should be given for
or against it.
One other point that I would like ta mention, honourable senators, is whether or not
parliament should meet again in the faîl,
adjourn for the Christmas vacation, resumne
and carry on until the Easter recess, then
resume and continue untîl prorogation, as
was done this session-which has been the
longest, I arn told, since 1903. Yet, apart
fromn the Criminal Code, the customary
decennial revision of the Bank Act, the
amendments ta the Bank of Canada Act, and
haif a dozen other fairly important bills, the
legisiation which has corne bef are parliament this session has been more or less
routine. Therefore it seems ta me that it
was unnecessary for us ta meet iast November at ail.
I think the government shouid take this
matter into consideration.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If parliament; opened
in September the other house would probabiy still be sitting in June of the following
year. I fail to see any advantage in meeting
in November, for it does not seem ta shorten
the session. If I had contrai of matters, I
would start the new session about January 10, and carry right on until the business
was finished; and I arn sure we wouid not
be here any inter than we are this year.
Dealing now with the Appropriation Bill
which is before us, I agree with the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) that honourabie senators
have had pienty of time ta consider the
estimates. I have had a copy of the estimates for more than three months and have
gone through themn frorn time ta time, and

SENATE
if I did not understand any item I inquired
and got the information. Of course, I was
very disappointed that the Chairman of the
Committee on Finance, the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), did
not set up his committee to study these
estimates, and I would like him to tell us
why. The committee did not meet last
session for the reason that parliament completed its work at an earlier date than usual
so as to allow many honourable senators and
members of the House of Commons to attend
the Coronation of our beautiful young
Queen. But during a number of preceding
sessions the committee did function, and in
my opinion it greatly facilitated a thorough
study of the detailed estimates by this branch
of parliament.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think I am in order
in asking the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) to tell us why
he did not set up the Finance committee this
session and provide us with the same opportunity we had in previous years ta study the
estimates in advance of their presentation
to this house. An annual budget of approximately five billion dollars is by no means
"peanuts".
Although honourable senators
have had the estimates before them for some
time, we would have been in a much better
position to consider them from the standpoint of the public interest if we had had an
opportunity to review them item by item in
committee.
Honourable senators, my supporters to my
right and to my leftHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -suggest that I say
nothing further at this time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
we have all enjoyed the remarks of the honourable acting Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
I listened with interest to his expression
of disapproval of the procedure and the
results that followed in the handling of a
certain divorce bill in the other bouse, and
the results that followed. Any suggestion
as to change of procedure in the handling of
divorce bills for the purpose of preventing
a recurrence of what happened in this
instance should, I think, be made after a
consideration of the matter by our committee.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I brought the question
before the house at this time in the hope
that some thought might be given to the
problem between now and when we next
meet.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it is a question that should be considered by the Committee on Divorce.
Whether at the next session parliament
should meet for a short time before Christmas
and resume late in January, or meet early
in January and continue until the business
is completed, is a matter of opinion. I am
not in a position to say which is the more
acceptable procedure, but I shal1 certainly
bring my friend's views in the matter to the
attention of the government.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I move the third
reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as indicated by the notice read by His Honour
the Speaker, the Deputy of His Excellency
will arrive at this chamber momentarily.
Pending his arrival, I move that the house
adjourn during pleasure.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
