SENATE

In a spirit or splendid loyalty and unfaltering
devotion, India and the Overseas Dominions
have vled wlth each other In co-operatlng with
the Mother Country to achieve this great purpose.
The call to service has evoked a wldespread
and notable response In Canada.
Âlready
120,000 men have crossed the seau, an equal
number Is now being actlvely trained and
equipped for service abroad, and a cail extendIng the authorized enlistment to hait a million
men has been received wlth warmn enthusiasm.
At the front our gallant soldiers have met
the enemy In repeated contesta, and by their
pre-emInent courage and heroic endurance have
shed lustre upon their country and upheld is
highest traditions.
Equally praiseworthy and Impressive bas
been the self-sacrificing and loyal spirit shown
by ail the Canadlian people who have freely
dedlcated their zmanhood and substance to the
common detence of the Empire.
The Ilie of the present Parliament expires
in the autumn of this year. and, under exlstlng
- legislation a dissolution and election would be
necessary in the early future. My adylsers,
however. are of the opinion that the wishes of
the Canadian people and the present requiremente of the war would be best met by avoidlng the distraction and confusion consequent
upon a general election at no critical a time.
That ;purpose can only be effected through
the medium of legisiation by the Parliament of
the United ICingdom. A resolution authorlzlng
and requesting the enactment of such legisniation as wlll extend the lite of this Parliament
for the perlod of ons year will be presented to
you.
Measures wlll be submitted for your conslderation to further the effective co-operation of
Canada In the defence cif the Empire and In
the maintenance of thia war waged for liberty
and laatlng 'peace.
If la a matter for profound thanlcfulness that
Providence bas blessed the lai ours of aur
husbandmen during the past year with the
m )st bountiful harvest in the history of Canada.
Gentlemen of the House of Commoas:

Han. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The loitiness and
happy strain of. the renîarks you have just
heard, hanourable gentlemen, increase the
hesitation, I should say the embarrassment
of one who, realizing ail the importance of
this hanourable Chamber and the warthitiesa af its members, rises ta speak for the
first time.
1 blesa the custom, hanourable gentlemen,
which requires that on this occasion at
least, I shauld speak in my mother tangue,
for if I have neyer more than ta-day ielt
deeply loyal and grateful towards Great
Britain, 1 must say that neyer also have I
feit prouder of my ancestars' country
sweet France which neyer ceased ta be
heroic France.
My first utterances in this House shall express ail the gratitude I owe ta the eminent
statesman who guides the destiny of this
country, as weil as ta the Ministers of my
own province, for the hanour canferred upon
me when I was selected by them 'toasit
among you. I wish. aiea ta convey my appreciation of your kind and cardial welcame
and far the gracious compliment your distinguîshed leader paid me when I was
invited, in spite of my parliamentary inexperience, ta jain thia veteran of public life,
honaurable Senatar Spraule, and second the
address in reply ta the Speech fram the
Throne.
When 1 rase ta speak, hanourable gentlemen, 1 felt that your eyes naturally sought
the statesman whom I was called here not

naenely:

ta replace, but ta succeed, and that is a
very high hanour. You may well believe
that more than ever at this moment, I bear
hîs memory in mind.

hie physical appearance .as well as in hie
moral and intellectual qualities, hie left us

guided by a broad and enlightened patriotism. I knew him from my childhood and
ail my life I have been honoured by his
friendship.
When, approaching by the river, and landing on the shores of the beautiful town of

Every time I' came in contact wîth this
man, 80 open and clear souled it seeined ta

rer, the truest qualities cf bis race crowned
by an unswerving faith, as bis village is
by the steeple of its churcli.
Allcw me, benourabie gentlemen, te lay
on this recently-closed grave the bomage cf
my admiration and deep, respect.
One who, for the firet time, listens witbin
these wails te the speech Irom the Tlu'one,
delîvered witb tbe pomp, splendeur snd
state that cliaracterize this ceremeny, cannet help being deeply impressed. In it
the 'majesty cf the crown and the severeignty
cf the* people are admirably united. We
are fortunate in baving, in a ycung and
democratic country like ours, a personality
as truly royal as that cf our Governor General, te constantly keep before our eyes tbe
image cf the impcsing and benevoient majesty cf the Britishi Crown. .
Some one h as very justly said that
history centaine several white pages, many
that are red withbhlood and a great many
black with mourning. Hew admirably fitted
those words are te our times. After sixteen
menthe cf a frightful struggle, bow many
pages cf our histery are stained with tbe
bloodcf our fellow-countryxnen. and darkened
by the xmourning of our familles. On the
other band, how many pages, thank God,
are and wili ever stay brightened with a
glory neyer te be dimmed. After sixteen
montbs cf bloodshed and slaugliter, victory
may seem distant, but it cannot fail te come.
What muet we do in order te secure it?
Our army already numbers nearly a quarter cf a million men snd tbe Government
appeals ta the patriotism cf this country te
increase this number, if need be, te hall a
million. The figure is an enormous one.
Who among us, a few years ago, would bave
thougbt our country capable of such effort?
The great armies cf tbe past lese mucli cf
the importance wbich is given them by hietory when tbey are compared with se formidable a military force. Hannibal upon leaving Carthage te, conquer Spain and part cf
the Roman Empire, had but 100,000 men
under hie banners. If my memery serves
me right, Napoleen bad with him net more
than 100,000 men wben be entered Moscew.
At the time cf the civil war in the United
States, there were in ail 160,000 combatanta
in the battielde cf Gettysburg.
Our country is young and its population
rélatively smnall, but its patriotîsm and courage viii net be found wanting. Our people
are relying on the loyaity and wisdom cf tbe
Government te be ahown tbeir duty, and
they wiil know bow te, accomplish it.
Allow me, benourable gentlemen, te, bew

te one of the members of this House, honcurable Senator Curry, who loat one of his
sons on the field of honour. I desire aiso
to recall the memory of one of your former
colleagues, honourable Senator Drummond,
whose distinguished. son, Mr. Guy Drummgnd, heroically gave up his life for his
country. 1 offer my congratulations to my
numereus celleagues whose names are se
nobly represented by their sons and relatives on the honour-roil of the army.
At one cf the numerous patriotic meetings
held by our ministers in the province cf
Quebec, I heard honcurable Mr. Patenaude
make a very touching comparisen. Speaking te the electors cf our rural districts, in
order to imprese upen them even more
vividly their duty of fiying te the defense
of their country, lie said: «'le there, gentlemen, a more inspiring spectacle than te, see
an Anglo-Canadian like Mr. Guy Drummolid
give up his life fer hie country, while commanding in Frenchi hie fellow-citizens cf
French enigin, and Major Roy, a FrenchCanadian generously aacrificing his life to,
save his soldiex's, while he was commanding
in Englieli bis fellow-citizens cf English
origin."
In*order te fittingly eulogize our gloricus
dead, I cannot do better than quote the
beautiful verses cf Victor Hugo:
Ceux qui pieusement mont morts pour la patrie.
Ont droit qu'à leur cercueil la foule vienne et
[prie.
Entre les plus beaux noms, leur nom est le plus
[beau,
Toute gloire près d'eux passe et tombe éphé[mère,
Et comme ferait une mère,
La voix d'un .peuple entier les berce en leur

Henourable gentlemen, our country bas
made a prodigious effort net only i the
number cf men contributed, but in the
amount cf menèy expended. Let us examine how this effort bas resulted witb regard
te tbe ecenomic condition cf the' country.
How did it affect oux external trade? I

in tbis respect, but will submit te, you tbat

from being impaired by the present criis,

Deaiing with this matter, Mr. Pense, the
general manager cf the Royal Bank, in bis
annual report, dated the 15th instant, enys:

absolutely impartial and competent testimony. Hear what Mr. Aird, the geixeral
manager of the Bank of Commerce, says in
his annual report published on the 17thi
instant:
CREDIT STRENGTENED.
This demonatration of what we can accomplish
under ipressure bas. of course, greatly strengthened the credit of Canada, n0 that, whiie, for
obvions rmasons. we cannot at the moment oel
mecurities ln Great Britain or ln Europe, we are

Increase in wealth taking place ln that country
at the moment. we may well hope la flot; of a
temporary character. During the past year,
leaving out the iast bal! of December, the sales
of Canadien securities aet home and abroad
amounted to about 336 millions. This mncludes
pearly 220 millions or Government accurities
and many sales o! other securities which arc
practicaliy refunding operations. The sales were
divided as foilows:
In Great Britain, mostly for re43,800,000
funding purposes.........
In United States..........144,800,000
In Canada.............14.7,100,000
$335,700,000
The Canadian figures are increased by the
Dominion boan of 100 millions, very littie of
which bas yet been paid to the Government.
The sales of municipal bonds, at one time dur-'
ing the year the matter of chie! concern to
those interested ln Canadian securities, amounted to about 64 millions divided almost equally
between the United States and Canada.

mies, we have been able to bring about a most
amazing adjustment from the prosperous enJovment o! 'an abounding flow o! borrowed
capital ta a condition of severe traite contraction. Our harveats have been bountiful, our
cultivated acreage has been Increased, and our
factories have been entrusted with large contracta for army equipment, munitions and foodstuifs. 'Whlle thia terrible war must bring us
much anguish and sorrow, It ls clcs.r that ln
proportion to ber population no country wili
benefit economically to a greater degree th-an
Canada.

To these optimistic views I now add those
of Mr. Pease, o! the ]Royal Bank, in the
above mentioned report.
The financial atatement presented to, you today 1s much better than we had reason to hope
for tweive montha ago. when the outlook was
regarded with grave conccrn. War was raging ln Europe and Industry every where was
Paralyzed. We bad been undergoing a drastic
liquidation, the resuit of over-expansion, and
the situation was greatly aggravated by the
outbreak of war which stopped the fl0w of
foreign capital and compelicd us to abandon
ail new construction. Nor did we know what
the war presaged, except tiiat we should. cheerfully take our part and contribute our chars ln
men and mneny. Contrant Our economic position thon with that of to-day, and consider the
remarkable transition from. depression and
gioom to condition. constltuting Ail the earMarks of ProsPerity. Who would have predicted
that within twelve montha thie Canadian public

asked. for? Our astounding recovery la due f0 a
remarkable Increane ln agricuiturai production,
te, prevaiiing high prices, f0 war munition orders,
and economies practised aince the war began.
Under Uic stimulus of $1.50 wheat. and the
pressure from ail aides to increase production,
farmera of the Northwest increased the acreage under thc cultivation 25 per cent, which,
wlth favourable climatic conditions. resulted «in
an increase of over 100 per gent lni the yield of
wheat, over 50 per cent ln oafis. and other grains
ln, proportion. Much credif la due to, the
Dominion Government and the banks for assistance extended to thc farmera by way of Uiberal
advances for thc purchase of seed grain. The
Government advancea for this purpose amounted
to $12.500.000.
The enormous demand for war materlals, catimated at over five hundred million dollars, has
given employmenf to every manufacturing plant
which could adapt itsel! ta requirements. No
less than 340 planta, large and smaîl, are engaged to-day ln the manufacture of sheila. The
industry bas proved an Inestimable boon to this

Canada there hae been no marked want or
destitution. Today there la plenty of work for
rnen all over Canada. while trade conditions
couid scarcely ho more hopeful. The pinch is
over and now alI we have to do ls to ha In
readiness for the good things of the future."
This quotation will show that the working
classes and labourers in general find plenty
of work and enjoy the prosperity resultîng
therefrom. I have carefully fc.Ilowed the
labour gazettes for the last few months, and
have found notihing contrary te Mr. Fern's
opinion, not only so far as the city of Mont4real is concerned, but as regards aIl other
parts of the country.
1 think I have shown, at least in a certain measure, that the generoux participation of oui country in aiding the sacred
cause of the allies, has improved onr economic condition outside as well as at hoine.
True our debt has considerably increasptl,
but it is equally true that the resources of
the country bave grown in woniderful proportions.
To mention the Western provinces alQfle,
as shown. by the figures just given, the
harvest of 1915 yielded us $300,0OO0 more
than that for 1914. I therefore submit, honourable gentlemen, that in spite of its wonderful effort, our nation is still in a position
to face and should undergo new sacrifices
until the tizne when 'the blessed hour of
victory ashall ring. We are bound te make
these sacrifices, in the first pl-ace because
the flag is ini danger and has been insulted
by the enemy's bullets, and because the
blood of oui fellow-countrymen fias been
shed.
This double appeal, te defend the fiag and
avenge oui dead, needs no comment witb
the immense majority of this country. It is
a caîl which a noble heart heeds and does
not allow the mind te 'dispute. Even our
material interests require these sacrifices.
Some dare te assert that this is net our
war. You remember what happened ini the

first days o! August, 1914? You recaîl the
panic, the complete paralysis o! business and
the slump in all our stocks? You recollect
people rushîng te the banks in order to
withdraw the few gold pieces on which. alone
they relied te carry tbem through days that
seemed se dark that they hardly ehowed a

ray of hope?
Confidence bad vanisbed, causing such
depression in aIl investments that they cou-Id
no longer be depended upon. I ask you:
what restored confidence and with it tbe
value cd these investments? The admirable
power and prowess of the British fleet. And
I feel I arn truly veicing new the deep gratiHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

tude of my fellow-countrymen for the priceIess service the fleet has rendered us.
There is stili another reason why the
French-Canadians of this country ehould do
their duty, and I will say, more than their
duty. They are the sons of the men who,
in 1870, when France was in agony, in their
grief, sadly closed their shutters, to endure
in the silence of deepair, the anguish of
defeat.
These men, thank God, have flot degenerated. Tbey remember the days of anxiety
through which they lived sixteen months
ago while waiting for the responfe of
Great Britain to the supreme appeal of
France. They stili hear those nole words
of Sir Edward Grey, addressing the English
Commons and saying: I declare that you
have no obligation whatever to defend
France, but on this question I ask every
one of you to searcb well in bis heart before
giving bis answer.
.And this response, honourable gentlemen,
given in a formidable manner, first by the
navy and then by the army of Great Britain,
bas meant the salvation of France.
Bornier said of France:
Terre du dévouement, de l'honneur, de la foi,
Terre du dévouement de l'honneur et de la foi,
Il ne faut donc Jamais désespérer de toi,
Puisque malgré tes Jours de deuil et de mi[aère.

Tbis hero, honourable gentlemen, was
Great Britain.
Could we of the province of Quebec,
wbile our two mother countries, one supporting the other and defending jusetice and
right against the barbarians, shedding their
blood together to save the life of the amaller
nations and the liberty of the world, could
we I say, of the province of Quebec, remain
unmoved by this spectacleP
No, neyer!
I wish yen could have witnessed, as I did,
the patrietîc meetings held in all parts of
iny province by Hon. Mr. Casgrain and the
other Quebec ministers. You would have
read in the attitude of the crowds and heard
in their warm response to the appeal of
these ministers, as well as of the liberal
leaders wbo generously took part in tbese
popular demonstratioiis, the unequivocal
answer of the population of may province.

throughout the whole of Great Britain.
The speech from the Throne deals with the
question of the number of men who have
been enlisted in this country and sent to
the front. Our men have made a record in
this war and shown themselves worthy of
the traditions of the Br*itishArmy and of
the whole Empire. We only hope that in
the raising of this extra number of men
which the Goverument propose te enlist,
every care will be taken in choosing
officera to rnake the selections only on the
bais of oonipetoency and efficiency. It is a

Lastterly we have had sme epeeches froin
membera of the Goverament on the queetions cf economy and the efforts every one
should ake te help ln the prosecution cf
thie wez. Whilst everybodýy throughout the
country realizes the great necessity of
economy and tiie4 evoey one ehould dû hie
very best to aid in the prosecution of the
war, yet to a great many people, it has
eccurred that i the addresses given by
varions members of the Governmen t froin
turne to time some o! the rernarks made
rnight possibly have been taken to apply
to the Governinent thernselves. Througb.
out the length and breadth of Canada the
people feel that there is considerable waste
in the carrying on cf the business cf the'
eountry; that rneney lis being expended on
work that doe net seern necessary; and
naturally, ini reading a speech by a minister pointing out the necessity cf avoiding
wvaste and urging the exercase of great
econorny, and cf not spendîng meney
on unnecessary tlungs, it ccurs -te people
that it would be better if the Government
would take these matters in hand theinselves and se if it je net possible to
curtail a great deal ef public expenditure
that does net seern te be necessary to the
prosecution of the war. The amount expended by the Public Werks Departrnent jin the
year 1914-15 reached the figure cf $29,283,
314, an increase over the expenditure cf the
previeus year cf $ 1,291,979. The expenditure cf that depariment in 1910-11 was
$ 11,807,035, shewing an enormous increase

spent in 1914-15 was spent on public buildings. Now it doe seern that îf the Government are irnpressed with the necessity of
econorny and the saving of the expenditure
of rnoney on unnecessary works, some of
lthose public buildings rnight have been dispensed with for the turne being at any rate,
and thus the expense could have been curtailed. We had an instance the other day
in Victoria cf the way in which meney is
wasted by the Public Works Departinent.
It came eut, in an inqul.ry befere the courts
there as te the buying cf ceai for the Public
Works Department, that although the Gevernrnent had a contract with one particular
firm whereby they were able te bny coal
at $5.25 per ton, they had been paying as
high as $7 and $7.50 per ton te a firin with
wbich they had ne centract. When urging
the people cf the country te exercise economy, it seems natural that the Governrnent
should give some reasen why they allow an
expenditure cf that kind te go on. When
we consider the amount cf money that we
have te apend for the prosecution of the war,
especially when the Government proposes
te raise thie extra number cf men, it is oertainly necessary that every eccnomy should
be exercised in carrying on the crdinary
business cf the country. The expenditure
involved in connection with the war je
large, and will increase from rnonth te
month as time goes on, s0 that ne one can say
exactly at the présent time what we ahaîl
have to expend under this head in the near
future. Therefore, we require te use vigilance te prevent waste; and we look te the
Governinent to set an example te the
people in these matters and show them,
mucb more than they have d4ine in the past,
that when tbey talk cf economy they are in
earnest in what they say. The commission
appointed by tbe Governinent at the end cf
last session, with Sir Charles Davidson as
chairman, have donç good work as f ar as
they have gene. They have shown th-at tbere
has been a considerable amount of waste in
the buying of supplies cf varions kinds for
the Government. The report cf this ceommission bas net se far been made public.
and we de net know more than we have
learned from the newspapers, but what bas
been published bas created an impression
tbat the Government have net shown sncb
care in spending the money cf the country
as the people have a right te expect at the
present time. In the prosecution cf this
war, a great deal has been done by the
country. The people have gene into it with
their whole heart, but 1 think that a great

provision that this price might be revised
ai the option of the Government on or after
March 31, 1916, the British Government undertaking to give three months' notice when
no more shelis were required. On this basis
thirty-one tenders had been received up to
November 1, of which nineteen were formaily accepted, the balance being under consideration. In Canada the price originally
paid for the machining and assembiing of
eighteen pound high explosive sheils was
$5.70 each, and orders for many thousand
sheils were let ai that price. The price in
Canada did not include the ceai of the steel
forgings for the sheil bodies, which were
supplied free to the contractors. Therefore, the cost in Canada on the. Australian

at war. There are times in 'the history oi
every country when national sentiment
sweeps everything before it, wben it is
more povierful than constitutional platitudes or doctrines, wvhen even national reason and caution and «Il other imaginary
safeguards, which the people will sometimes
build up in their statute-books and constitutional praetice, are s'wept away ?oy the
wave of national sentiment. Such hasbeen
the case ini Canada. War was no sooner
declared than the peoples of ail the Overseas Dominions forgot about distinctions in
Governments and boundaries, or tl>at Vhiey
had not 'the »mee voice in var and peace
as the people of Great Britain. These things
faded into insignificance in the -face of thie
fact that they belonged to the Empire and
theat 'the Empire vas in jeopardy. Hence,
nro sacrifice vas toc great to maïke for the
safety and integrity of the Empire in which
they had a common interest and ail belonged. Entirely apart from 'this irresistible
viave of sentiment, which so swept over the
entire Empire there are thie concrete facts
to be considered that this war is our wair
as muoh as At is the war cf the people cf
Great Britain, or the viar cf -any of the
Allies cf Great Britain. When the declaration of var was made on the 4Vh August,
1914. Canada hecaie as much in jeopardy
as Great Britain or-the country of an' cf
its Allies, -and entirely apart frein tradition and sentiment and basing our attitude
upon common sense and reason, it became
the imperative duty cf Canada at that moment to liecome as active a participant
in the war as any of our Allies.
Though the, enemy possibly may not
be at our gates, though the smoke o! battle
and the tumult of var may be confined te
European 'theatres of the var, suoh as those
in Flanders, in France, in Russia, or in
Turkey. the duty of defence lies -upon us
as imperatively as it does upon the Allies.
A Iarge section of the people of Canada up
te the present time have oriîy 'been exercised by the sentimental view of the -situation and not by reason cf the possibility
cf our .suffering from the actualities of var
on our shores. The safety of Canada is
entirely dependent on the success cf the

conquest ini the effete east, -but room for
German expansion in the western hemisphere; room for its millions of congested
population. For years Germany has 'been
conscious of the advantages Canada would
afford for German expansion. Germany,
througb its system of espionage. has a
more.thorpugh knowledge of Canada in the
pigeon-holes of its foreign office than
would be found in the -departinents of our
ovin Government. Our natural and developed resources, our uno-ceupied lands,
our forests, our mineraIs, our harbours and
ports, cur great systems of transportation
býy land and water, are au intimately kn-own
by Germany as lby our ovin people. Do
ot let us delude ourselves into the idea
that 'the eyes of Germany have not been
upon Canada. For years we have 'been
under the observation of its spies a'nd tAie
observation of its foreign office. Here is a
country with resources and possibilities be-_
yond the conception cf the human mind;
capable under German systema of efficiency
and organization of *ustaining 200 million
people, with the climatie conditions that
appeal more to the German people th-an
to any other people in EuTope, Iying alcngaide the United Btates within the bound&ries cf which are to be found ten to
twelve millions German people; more Germans than are to be féund in any country
outside of Germany. The greatest menace
to Canada from this war lies in this situation. Our secuzity, our very existence as
a free people lies in the defeat of Germany
in Europe. Once let the German arxnies
break through that 400 miles on the western front in Flanders and France, once let
German. armies reach Pa'ris, crush France
and concen'trate upon Russia, what would
be England's chance of repelling Germany's
viar machine, the greatest fighting machine
the world bas ever seeln? Assuming that
Great Britain should meet rwith defeat or
even less than that, namely 'that our Allies

should -be defeated,

and Germany

should.

direct her attention to Canada, what then
would be our fate? in fact, were Ger.many
to triumph 'to-day, there is ne territory belonging to Grea't Britain or any of ouur
Allies that would appeal te it w strongly
as Canada. In tact Canada would logically
be the only area of great territory 1that
would asppeal to Germany for the settlement
and expansion of its congested population.

lianG in the United States convert witho-ut
difficulty Canada into a trans-Âtlantic Germany, and this notwithstanding the Monroe doctrine. The application cf the Monroe doctrine at suoli a tinie by the United
States could only te asserted in proportion ta the force cf anms behind it. Under
the'conditions which I have outlined thls
ta Germany would be regarded very muceh
as the treaty af neutrality which Belgium
had with Germa-ny. I point these tbings
eut ta impress you if possible that this ls
the fight of Canada as much as it is the
fight cf France and Great Britain. We are
as much interested in the resuits as any
of the Allies. Our liberties, our security, aur -homes, aur
ounmtry a-re as
much at stake as were those cf t.he Belgians
or those of our Allies. We are in this figlit
nolt for mere sentiment "but for everything
we hold most dear. We have a duty ta
perform in smasbing the Germans as mucli
as any of the Allies engaged in the fight.
If the Allies fail we are as mucli erusfied
and lest as they. If they -win we bave
saoved Canada as mucb as the Allies ha-ve
saved the country for wbich they- have
fougbt.
The manifest duty ef Canada at the moment is- ta help aur Al-lies ta proseoute'
tbis war ta the end. There is no alternative exoept we become passive anmd
are prepared ta acept the subjugatian by
Germany cf aur country and aur race. The
figb't must -be made with the sanie inten.sity
and seriausness as if the enemy 'were thundering for -admission at our gates. Keep in
mmnd that because the operatians cf war
are being conducted on European fields that
in the ultimate ana-lysis and consequence
the results as ta Canada -would be the same
as if war were -being waged within or adjacent ta aur orwn boundaries. All aur
energies and resources must be enlisted in
carrying on this fight with the same lintensity a-s o 'ur Allies. Our national existence is dependent an 'the fight we make.
With the enarmous resources cf men and
treasure on orne &ide represented by the
Empire and aur Allies there ultixnately can
be only one conclusion ta the war, and ini
that conclusion we must he as active participants as aur Allies. Canada, must be
prepared ta enlist alI lier resources and to
pledge bier support ta the Empire and ber
Allies irrespective cf ahl otber consideratiens. Let me say in conclusion that I
hope the session rwill not be .unnecerrarily
long anmd that the publie business which
it will be the duty of the Geverniment ta

bring down niay be -proseeuted iby the
Sena-te with satisfaction ta itself and *with
profit ta the country.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I rise merely to inake
a few o-bservations on the speech whioh
His Royal Highness bas delivered to the
House, wiLh. *possibly a few references to
that .just made *by the hon, leader of thbe
Government. Before proceeding ta these
,natteTsý I feel that it is *my duty ta congratuls4e the House, as well as thie mover
and seconder of the Address, on the fact
that those hon, gentlemen bave been added
ta the -Senate.
The hon. gentleman from Grey <Hon.
Mr. 6proule) pleaded that as a young member--I do not know whether hie said unaccustomed ta public speakin-some allowance should be made for his inexperience
and youthfulnèss. Now, that was very
modeat. Possibly
the hon. gentleman,
having been four years in the comparatively serene atmosphere of the sp
e's
chair, bas rather got out cf the way of
publie speaking ; but from hie speech I
think ho did not ,seem to have suffered
in that 'way as much as lie niight, and 1
have no doubt that we ehail often hear
from him, and ta advantage, during thxis
session. I may say. further, with respect ta the hon, gentleman from Grey,
that his selection iby. the Government for
membership In liMs House was a judicious
one. The hon. gentleman bas a lavge parliamentary experience, which is an important thing. He has long familiarity w'ith
public lée, which ie aira important; and
hie ie clear-headed, and 1 might say is not
given ta expeniding money wastefully, and
that is also a good dharao-teristie for a sensibor. Wibfle I was able fta a cerban extent
t6 foliow the hon. gentleman from Montarville, I regret ta say that my hearIng is
not perfect and 1 did not captch everything
that he.said; but I had beard very favourable accounts of the hon. .gentleman, anmd
expected something- very good indeed, and
wa-s not disappointed. One thïng that impressed me very favourably was that the
bon. gentleman, in beginning his speech,
referred ta the hon. gentleman w-hom he bas
succeeded, the late Senatar DeBouchervillf. I t'hink #we all have the same feeling
about that hon. gentleman. He was in
yea.rs the senior member of this House. I
have 'the melancholy distinction of having
been bis senior as a mnember of the House,
(but hie was quite a -bit ahead of me in
years. We had ail learned ta like and

respect him. He was perfectly inoffensive,
agreea.ble. and though strong in lis party
views was neyer offensive or aggressive tawards other people, and bis private lite was
just as admirable as hie public life. In
the late hon. gentleman frein Montarville
the Senate let a mnen who could truly be
described as a Christian gentleman.
In reference te the speech of the hon.
leader ot the Governinent, I quite agree in
his concluding observations. This 'war je
Canada's war just as much as it is the
war of England; and it is aur duty ta exeit
ourselves just as much as it 'le the duty of
the people of England ta exert themees.

gentleman assumed, I judge from the tone
of his speech that ta a. certain extent hie
sympathized with those of his colleagues
who thought there should ha;ve been a dissa1utk~n in Octiober of 1914. or thuat theme
should have been a dissolution in June,
1915.
Han. Mr. LOUGHEED-Oh,
have been satisfied with one.

I

would

Hon. Mr. POWER-The han. gentleman
did not say that distinctly, but I flhink that
hbis speech indieàted Tather that his sympathies were that way. Now, if it wauld
have been right and proper ta have had a
d.ssalutian last June when the war was at
its height and when perhaps our warmaking maehinery was not in as goad running order as it is now, why ehould it bc
absolutely neeessary that we shauld not
have a dissalutian next'Octaber? That is
oomething that I do flot altogether understand. And if the han. gentleman will allow
me ta say sa, hie was not quite accurate in
his statement with respect ta thse practice
in the paost. He said that the uniform
practice had been that Parliament was dissolved before its turne had expired.
Hon. Mr. LOÛGHEED-I did not intend
ta say that. I said almast withaut any exception.
Hon. Mi. POWER-I haveno doubt the
hon. gentleman meant ta qualify it, but as
a maitter of tact hie did not. The truth is
-that thse Parliament. of' '78 held for live
sessions. The PaTliament elected in '67.
whioh. ran tili 1872, was alive for five years.
The next Hause, eleeted in 1872, -was dissolved on aceaunt af thse Pacifie scandai;
but the 1878 Hause sat for five yéars as
did thse House eleeted in 1891. It seems
ta me that thse ,normal and fair thing
is, that, unless there is some very seriaus
reason for a dissolution earlier than the expiration of the terni, thse members who are
elected for five years should hold their
seats for five years. There has been a disposition on the. part of the Government of
thse day ta take advantage of their opponents, and I think that an election aught
ta be fought out an even termas. Thse hon.
gentleman, as one Tesson for a dissolution,
I suppose in 1914, spoke ofthlie large
financial obligations whieh thse Government
had inherited from their predecessors. - 1
grant that thse Government did isenit large
financial obligations, and I think it was the
duty of this Government as a body af
prudent men ta irnmediately set ta work

ta eut down thse expenditure se as ta enable
themn the botter ta meet those obligations.
Instead of that they largely increased. the
expenditure in every departmnent of the Government and inereased it in some cases
in a most unjustifiable way. Take the
Cust>oms, thse Post Office, and oCher departmenti, and you will find that while a
large number o! employees were dismissed,
double the number were appointed ta take
their places.
There was a perfect carnival. It was a case of " lot hier go. Gailagher " during thse first twa or thTee sessions, and there is no knowing where we
would have been naw if it had nat been for
thse war. In tact. there is no knowing where
we are even witth the war. With respect ta
this particular paragraph we are dealing
with, the( hion, leader of the Government
said it must be discussed at an early date.
I 'tako the liberty ta differ with the hon,.
,gentleman tisane. Tise Ha-use of Gommons
does not die until next October. The
British Hous of Gommons died tuis month.
Did they say in England that tise House
ahould. last untul the *expiration of the year
after the war ' Not at all. They extended
the terni ot their Parliament fer eight
months. Tise lite of our Parliament extends nine months tram the present Lime.
The English House of Gommons, with the
extension, dies in September next. Our
-House does nat die un-til Octaber.. It really
does -not appear ta me that thero is any
special reason why we sisould, be in a hurry
about this thing. I say it is not an urgent
matten. This session will probably mun

extended,
it
shall be
of Commons
will be time enough ta
deal with
tisat matter somewhere in tise latter part
of the month of March. By that time things
will have developed. We may :be in a position ita say whiether the war is about coming
ta an early termination or not, and at any
rate I think that instead of adding a yean
ta the lite of the existing Parliament, thse
proper sort o! measure would be ta provide
tsai tise House of Gommons shaîl lîve until,
say. six manths after the signing of the
treaty o! peace.
-Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-That is not what
they ask.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I know that, but that
is what they ought ta ask. Thene is just
one other point ta whioh I should like to
draw the attention of the leader of tise Gov.ernment-a statement he-made tawards the

SENATE

close of bis speech, because 1 feel (he did
not intend that bis words Whould. bear the
meaning that might be attached to them.
He spoke of the presence of a number of
German settiers in Canada, as well as in
the United States, as being in a sense. s
source o! danger, or a menace. I do flot
tbink that is the case. I know, speaking
for the province from which I corne, that
we havet a large German population, or
population of German descent, particularly
in the county o! Lunenburg, and those men
are not à bit more disloyal than any of their
neighbours, and they are enlisting ko go ko
the front in Lunenburg, as well as ini other
counties.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I should be sorry
to reflect on those people, but I refer to the
Gormans we have placed in the interrnent
camp.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I feel certain the hion.

who have departed this life since last

On the other hand, as ail these seats ought

of this House.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-And carrying in
his pocket a speech which I delivered ini
tliis House on the Navy Bill, hie was on
Liberal
meeting the
e very hustings,
speakers with rny speech, saying that I wae
a great independent man, reading rny
speech, and I may say that this was the
best part of bis own. 1 arn sorry bie is not
iii bis seat just now, but I hope that hie will
retain the good opinion of me which hie
expressed then. Having said so much, 1
shall now proceed ko discuss the two very
important items contained in the speech
from the Throne. These items are, money
and mçn ko continue the war, and the
extension of this termi of Parliament, in

JANUARY 19, 1916

order to allow the present cabinet ministers
to retain their portfolios, and for the
present mnembers'elected to' oppose this
Governrnent in 1911, 'to remain in their
places a few montha longer.
1 do not
intend to make a political speech, but 1
mnust be permitted the liberty ta refer te
some of the declarations of publie men
who now occupy the treasury benches and
gentlemen who are
in that House.
Naturally, the first question which one
asks hirnself, and the question which must
have been asked of you, and which has
been put ta me a hundred tirnes .in rny
office, on the street, in the car and everywhere, is: Who is responsible for this terr.ible war which is costing se much money
and s0 many lives? I read not later than
the 15th of this month, in a very important
paper-though it is a Tory one-the Gazette
of Montreal, under the heading of "Mr.
.Lavergne's position," the following:
l'he Government of Great Britain thought
it necesary In defence of li Intereste and In

diacharge of its treaty obligations to other
countries te declare war againat Germany whlch
tnvolved, In Umne, declaration of war against
Âustria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.

-

Be there is an assertion that England began- the war. I must dissent from that.
I amn probably too loyal te say that England is responsible for the war; enly when
history cornes ta be 'written will we know
%hat nation began the war. At the -sarne
time I arn bound te say, as a citizen cf
this country and a British subject, that
if England did net begin the war, she is
dornewhat Tesponsibie for it. I shall try
ta prove that by quotations frorn officiai
bocks. Every one rnust take his share of
the responsibility, and later on we wil
exactly .know who is responsible for the
war. So, theugh I disagree with the
Gazette saying that England has declared
war, 1 say England is somewhat responsible for the war. Had England net been,
in the hast days of July, 1914, flirting a
littie with Germany, had she declared at
once that she would stand by the trea-ty
she signed with Russia, iFrance and Belgiurn, there would have been ne war, that
is my opinion. If you look at France',z
Yellow Book, what we cail the Documents
Diplomatiques, 1914, re Guerre Européenne,
you will find document No. 92, dated 29th
Juhy, 1914, frorn Jules Cambon, French
Ambassador at Berlin, to the French
Minister of Foreign Affairs, which sumrnarized it as folhows:

Jusqu'à ces tout derniers jours on s'est flatté
icI, que l'Angleterre resterait hors du débat,
et l'impression produite par son attitude est
profonde sur le gouvernement allemand et sur
les financiers et hommes d'affaires.
Jules Cambon.
Mon collègue d'allemagne ayant Interrogé
air Edward Grey sur les Intentions du gouvernement britannique, le secrétaire d'Etat aux
Affaires -étrangères a répondu qu'il n'avait pas
à se prononcer quant à présent.
8fr Edward Grey ne m'a pas caché qu'il trouvait la situation très grave et qu'il gardait peu
d'espoir dans une solution pacifique.
Jules Cambon.
To that day, July 29, 1914, Germany was

under -the impression that England wculd
stand aside'Hon..
Carson.

Mr.

CLORAN-On

accunt

of

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE- -and
by,
this attitude has produced *a profound impression on the German Government and
on financial and business men. On the
same day in despatcb No. 97, M. Cambon
says: " My German colheague having
asked Sir Edwird Grey the intention of
the British Governmhent, the Secretary fer
Foreign Affait s an4swered that lie lias
nothing ta, say-for the momnent, thcugh
adding that .he finds the situation very
serious and grave." That ls a few days
before the war; so I claim that though
England did net begin the war, -she could
have prevented it by answering firmly and
squarely *tlat she would defend Belgium
and France if attacked. I hope that when
history cornes te be written it will prove
that hadl England deolared formally that
she would -stand by the tTeaty and resiat
the invasion cf Belgium, we would bave
had ne war. I arn willing te admit that
England acted in good faith, believing
tliat tliere would be ne war, but al
sliould bear their own share of the responsibility, whether as Gevernmènts, members cf Governrnents, senators or eveu
simple electors. In the face of these facts,
I amn net saying anythinig about Engiand;
but we have te discuss the question cf war

Having said that 1 ask whether the declaration, repeated yesterday by the leader
of the Government, and repeated hundreda
of times by the leaders of both parties in
the last few years, that when England is
at war, Canada is at war, is true? I ,say
no; and I say so in the light of declarations made in this country ince Confedzration, by leadîng' statesmen, the MacCartTupper,
Blakes,
the
donalds,
wright, and Laurier hirnself. AIl. those
great patriots were unanimous before 1910,
or about then. It neyer before was said
and neyer was believed that when England
was at war, Canada was at war. The very
contrary was declared; but I remember
the Hon. Mr. Fielding, in a public speech
at Montreal saying, in defending hie policy,
that England being at war Canada is at
war. Since then this bas been repeated
"-v the Liberals; but'by the Tories it has
outif been repeated ince th.ey are in
power after the election of 1911. Duxing
that election, as I shaîl prove in a moment,
they took the opposite view; they said, no
war, ne men, no money for England. And
a member of the present Government, Mr.
Blondin, said on the platform, - We owe
nothing to England, we have been obliged
to shoot hales in the British flag te let in a
little air of liberty." 1 say thià, having
nothing political in my mmnd, but merely
narrating cL little bit of. history. I repeat
that I do not think thîs motte, repeated
yesterday with great eloquence by the
leader of this Houee, is true-that England
being at war, Canada is at war. 1 say that
such a doctrine is contrary te facts, contrary te the political constitution, and
-contrary te the declarations of our public
rien ince Confederation. In fact at one
time when England was at war, the Prime
Mînister of that day, Sir John Macdonald
himself, declared that he had nothing to
do wi&h that. In the Boer war what was

It was declared that this should not be
taken as a precedentP -Why? If we are at
war when England is at war, we are obliged
te send men te fight bier battles, as we are
doing now. Why add this rider te the
remolution declaring that we muet send
men across the Atlantic and pay for thern?
JHon. Mr. CHOQUETTE.

Because the declarations of ail the leading
statesmen of both parties until now have
been to the effeet that we had'nothing to
do with foreign wars, and that our militia
and our xnoney were to be kept in this
country for the defence of the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Hear, hear, perfectly
right.
.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Now what bas
happened? We have to go a littie into the
history of what took place during *the last
election. I muet deny the statements made
by some hon. gentlemen as to my position
on the naval question. I did not denounce
the principle of a Canadian navy at the
time-my speech is there, and that speech
has been the burden of all the Tory candidates. I quote this now to show that ail
the Liberals are not of the saine opinion.
I said, "You must not impose a great

ent as what Sir Herbert Boit had said. Mr.
Peterson is suppoaed to be a friend of Mr.
Bolt, and -must have dined with him saine
day in the week; but how is it thaît Mr.
Peterson bas neyer written that he mnay or
ought to lie arrested and neyer s4id a word
about Vhis interview? Yet Mr. Peterson
writes a letter saying that Mr. Bourassa is
guilty. I mig.ht say of treason, -but lie had

Northoliffe, for Mr. Carson, who is to a

that it would lie unfair to Maine Mr. Bourassa when he is flot willing to blame Mr.
Hoit, who said ton turnes more. In quoting this interview with Mr. Boit I do flot

Boit spoke about, but I use it te show how
unfair it is to blame other men, especially
Frenchmen' who may hold views flot so

Holt's as published in the Giazette. Now
in Ontaoeio it is said that the Frenchi asking for their rights ini that province are

did we ses in England when the question of
Home Rule was before Parliament? Mr.
Carson was prepared to bring on civil war
to prevent 'home rule from passing.

I am reading this because it is worthy to
be put down as the opinion of a prominent man and te defend the opinions of
others who have just as much right as Mr.
Boit has te put their views before the
country.
I repeat there has neveu been

This is the position of this

before the British Pa'rliarnent. They are
going to pass a Conscription Act. What wae
the bargain? No-bargain ie a bad expression-what were the negotiations -between
the Irieh people and the Government. The
Nationaliste* were against conscription, but
they ýsaid, "We are willing te permit the
Bill te pass if you will e7xelude Ireland, and
se oh." Tdiat je a negotiation; there is ne
blackmailing there. In Quebec there are
some -men who say te Ontario: "You are
trampling on the constitution te deprive
us of our right, of our liberty, of our
language, and before asking a favour cf us
the least you can do je te give us justice." I
must en passant congratulate the honeurable Speaker cf this House on the stand ha
took on this question, aise my hon. friend
Hon. Mr. Belcourt, cf Ottawa, fer the stand
hbe teck constitutionally, legally, and sentimentally-if necessary te say that-on thie
question. On the other hand, I proteet
againet the expreesien cf soine yeilow papers
in Toronto saying that it was an attempt te
bargain. I have the right te say te a man
who asks me for a faveur, "I amn willing te
help yeu, but the lest you can do je not
te trample on my rights, and te do me justice."
Hon. Mr. DAVIDý-Wibat have England
and France te do with the sehool quee;tion?
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-The question 1
arn now speaking about je enlietment in
Quebec; I did net say. a word about France.
I was answering Ontario papers that «are
abuaing us. My hon. friand, who is suppeeed ini -words à&Ilea6, te he irea4'y ta
fight for 4ba languaga und for provinciel
righte and iiberty, should be the firet te
support me and say thatlI arn righbt. Now,
my hon. friend the leader'cf the Government
yesterday said that we might be invaded
hy the Germans from the Un.ited States,
that there is a menace from the United
States; that if Germany is victerious we
may not be free. I hope Germany wil]
neyer be victorieus, and that the Allies wilI
be succeseful in the end, notwithstanding
the words of Lloyd George -toc late;- but
I make this argyment te show that many
are of the opinion that, accrding te the
constitution, our soldiere and our money
ought te -be kept in this ceuntry to defend
cureelves. I say if it je true, as the hon.
leader said, that Germany might corne here
and try to invade and conquer Canada-if
it is a fact that we may be in danger, that
ie a good argument for saying, "Then keep

our soldieres here, keep our money te defend ourselves." Though I arn sure, even if
by any pessibility Germany should be vietoTicus, tbere is ne danger of them, coming
inte Canada. They weuld be tee friendly
with the United States, and it might happen
that we would become independent, as'Belgium wae before the wa.r, or jein the United
States. But that je net the question; we are
glad te be as we are, and we desire te
stay as we are, loyal te England, and loyal
especially te Canada. But I repeat that
if, as a fact, there is danger cf invasicn
from the United States, that may be goed
reasen te argue that we ought te 'keep our
men, our army, in Canada in case cf
danger, and then those who are supporting
that view ought net te be abused and
called names.
In dealing with these two subjects in
the Speech frorn the Throne, I have unfcrtunately taken up some side issues and
tee rnueh time; but as to the two items I
would repeat that I amn strengly cpposed
te extending for one minute the terrn cf
this Parliarnent, for the resens I have
given; and I agree with the Gazette and
the Citizen that you have no mnandate te
raise in thie country a force of 500,000 men
and apend hundreds of millions cf dollars
withcut going back te the people -and asking thern if they laveur such- a policy.
If the majority cf the people give you carte
blanche I «hall be the firet to vota ail the
millions necessary and help you te Taise
ail the men you want; but I eay that you
have ne mandate te do that. On the contrary, the present, Governmene was elected
te oppose the very action they are taking
now. On the whole, having fran-kly and
honestly expressed my views, I protest
againat all those whe would say I have
uttered a word which is unbeceming to
a true and loyal citizen and elector of this
Dominion.

Why these invidious comparisons? There
may be hundreds of reasons why one part
of the country is in a position to do better
than another. There is flot going to be any
conscription in this country. There is no
need of it, there is no legal obligation to
serve. Se why should we scrutinize, and
inquire why this one and the other one has
flot gone? *We know that there has been a
generous response on the whole to the caîl

that manhood of Canada will continue to
assert itself.
Why should. I aàk my

not gone to the war? 'That is not going ta

New Brunswick has not sent men ta the

is flot 'that they are less loyal than I am; I
know they are just as loyal. What is the
good of ail this talking? Let us do our-duty
without ail these invidious, or odious, companisons. As far as Quebec is concerned, I
am quite sure that the province is bound ta

we can. Let me conclude by repeating the
words I used before: I hope there wiil be
no limait whatever ta the contribution of

that which the.neceasities of the case impose and our own capaciity warrants.
Honi. Mr. BOLDUC-I't was flot my intention to speak on the Address in reply ta the
speec'h frem the Throne, -but after the remarks made by the hon. gentleman from
Grandville I thought it my duty te zay a few
words. I rnust say that I concur entirely
with the remarks made by the hon, gentleman from Ottawa <Hon. Mr. Belcourt> in
rebuke of the speech mnade by thé hon.
gentleman from Grandville. He bias voiced
the French opinion not only in Quebec, but
in the wbole Dominion. I do not want hon.

Grandville spoke in the province of Quebec

Hon. Mr. BOLDUC-The hon. gentleman

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-No.
Hon. Mr. BOLDUC-The proof that England was againat going to war is that they
did all they coultl to prevent ài. I have
read all the despatches which were published between Gernîany and England, and
1 muet say that one of the greatest diplomats England ever had was Sir Edward
Grey. He conducted that correspondence
with the greatest ability, and if lie hiad
been able to prevent the war we are sure
tlîat a ni of bis ability would have done
so. But it was no use; Germany had
decided upon war. The killing of two nien
froni Austria-Hungary was only a pretext.
Tlîe central empires had been organizing
for the last 45 years; they had been arming
themeselves, and tlîought that tlîey could
crush everybody that dared to oppose theiin.
We muet admit that they came very near
to crushing- France entirely. Having ruined
Belgium, killing men, women and children,
Hon. Mr. BOLDUC.

they nearly reached Paris, and came vcrv
near to exterminating France. Why is it
that France was flot crushed as Belgcium
was crushed? Because England came to
hier help; because, notwithstanding Enzland's lack of preparation, they came with
ail the soldiers they had to the help of
France. And now, hon. gentlemen, whiat
hias England done? Whienwe are to]d that
England is doing nothing, I ask why are
we safe on this side of the Atlantic? How
would we have fared without the powerful
navy of England? The coasts of Canada
would have been invaded; Canada by this
tiîne would probably have been in the
hands bf the Germane. Some will say that
we wvou1d be îirotected by the Americails.
It is childish to say such things, in my
opinion, because if Germany could defeat
England, France, Russia and Relgium, wliat
resistance coul d the United States offer to
a German invasion? However, it is idie. to
talk of it; and, as the hon. nieînber for

rather than ask the assistance of our
neighboure.
In the province of Quebec
during the last election, accupations were
hurled against some minieters, but I can
say to-day that I arn proud of our leaders
on both aides of politics in the province of
Quebec. I arn proud of Sir WVilfrid Laurier,
Lemieux, Casgrain, Sevigny, Blondin and
ail those men; they are acting loyally;
t.hey are doing their duty. Notwithstanding what they may have said in the past,
when war was declared they *aàâd they
would be loyal, and loyal they are. If we
have domestie difficulties, is it for the
minority to insuit the rnajority, as the
Nationalists are doing to-day? Is it, not
be tter, as bias been stated by the lion.
member for Ottawa, to wait to settie those
differences after the war is over and peace
lias been signed? I say without hesitation
that the minority in this Dominion have
rilits, and those rights will be chamipioned with best hope of success by the

their blood with the English, French and

Emîpire I feel it rny duty to say that they

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I did not intend ta participate in this debate, but the
speech of my hon. friend from Grandville
draws me ta my feet; and since I am on
my feet I must join with my colleagues
in cong-ratulating the mover and seconder
of the Address upon the epeeches they delivered, and to congratulate the House
upon their presence among us-the Hou se,
and the Government as well; I should nlot
forget their colleagues 'who accompanied
them when they were introducéd in this
House at the opening of the session. My
hon. f riend from Grandville bas been, in
a belligerent mood this afternoon, and bas
covered conciderable ground ta lay before
this . House the grievances or reeriminatiens of numbers of people 'who have
spoken upon the cubjeet of the war since
the flrst of August, 1914. The first argumient which he tried to mnake before this
Chamber was that hie was no-t sure if he
could not establish t.hat Great Britaîn, by
its dîlatoriness in declaring itself in favour
of the Allies, had not permitted Germany
ta take for granted that Great Britain was
not ini it, and that it could. wage successful war againest France and Russia. Well,
I have heard that affirmation before, and
I am sorry for my hou. friend to say that
it is ini the " Devoir" and from Mr. Boutassa's pen that I learned it.

What wvas the answer of Sir Edward Grey
to that communication? On the 3Oth July,
before Germany had issued its ultimatum to
Russia, Sir Edward Grey communicated
this answer to Sir Edward Gosehen:
Foreign Office, JuIy 30, 1914.
(Telegraphlc)
Your teiegrarn of 29th July.
His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the Chancellor's proposai that
they should. bind themuselves ta neutrality on
sucli ter'.a
What lie asks us ln effect is to engage ta
stand by whule F'rench colonies are taken and
France la beaten so long as Germany does nlot
take Frenclh territory as distinct fronm thie
colonies.

From the materlal point of view suci :% posai la unacceptalile. for France. without f urf romn r.o.
ther terrltory in Europe being taken
could lie no cruslied as to lose lier position as
a Great Power, and becomne subordinate ta
Gerinan pollcy.
Altogether apart from that, it would lie a
disrace for us to make this bargain with
Germnany at the expense of France, a d;sg-ace
from whlch the good naine of this country
would neyer recaver.
The Chiancellor aise ln effect asks us tD bargain away whatever obligation or inter*s;t 7,e
have as regards the neutrality of Belgium. We
could not entertain that liargain eliher;
Havlng said so mucli It la unnecessary to
examine whether the prospect of a future
general neutrality agreement between England
and Germany offered positive advantages sufficient to compensate us for tylng aur bands
iiow. We must preserve our full freedom, Ca
act as clrcumstanoes may seemn ta us ta require
in any sucli unfavourable and regrettable developenient of the present criais as the Ob7oncellor contemplates.
Yeu sbould speak to the Oban,_-lor in thie
above sense and add most ý.rnesLlv tlîat the
one way of 'malntalng the good relation between England and Germany is tbat they
sliculd continue ta work together to prescrve
the peace of Europe; if we succeel in this
abject, the mutual relations of Geriiîiy and
England will, 1 believe. lie "ipso facto" m
proved andi strengthened. For that object His
Majesty's government will work in thlat wvay
wlth aIl sincerity and good-will.
Now, this is the answer af Great. Britain
on the 3Oth July, and, no one will ever
question the fact that when Germany sent

its ultimatum the evening af that day to
Russia, it was perfectly aware that Great
Britain wvas t0 stand with the Allies. Gernîany's hope was, in a sudden and rapid
assault an France, ta crush that country,
and s0 stupify the world that Great Britain

would perhaps hesitate; but as ta taking
the risk af facing a conflict with Great
Britain, there is no question that Germany
knew on the 3Oth July that Great Britain
would stand by France if France was
attacked, and if Belgium, more especially,
Germany took its risks,
was invaded.

through Ontario?
Hon. Mr. CASGRMIN-I was strongly
in favour of that, -and spoke for it more
than once in this House, and we will ha
carried away from the -subjeet under discussion if we follow that question. As a
matter of fact, the former Administration
glave a guwianite of bonde of $35,000 a mile
for the 1,050 mâlles from Port Arthurîto the
city of Montreal, and that bcan was a first
mortgage upobn that road. At thiat time I ' for
one, believed that the Government of the
country would neyer be called upon to pay
either principal or interest, because 1 knew
full 'well that the road would cost from
$55,000 to $60,000 a mile, and consequently
the first mortgage of 835,000 was absolutely
secured, and that they would get traffic
f rom Port Arthur to Montreal. That was
the condition, but as to the other section
westward froar Edmonton, I speak advisedly when I say that the former Administration did flot gîve any subsidy to
the Canadian Northern Railway. When 1

of this House were too polite to ridicule
the statement, but I could see a great deal
of incredulity on the part of members of
thîs House, who thought that such a thing
was not possible. I arn glad to find the,
Grand Trunk Pacifie, or National Transcontinental Bailway, actually being vindicated
by mèmbers of this Government in the last
few daya, corroborating 4ot only what I
have said, but going further. They have
offered to carry grain for 25 per cent lesa
than the rate mentioned, and carry the
wheat 600 miles further. The hion. Minister
of Railways (Hon. Frank Cochrane) has
made arrangements to carry wheat from a
point oalled Armstrong, near Superior Junetion, to tide water-not to Quebec, but 600
miles furthér, te St. John or Halifax, for 6
cents a bushel. Now, we were ail regarded
as Iltopians when we spoke of 8j cents. The
Government 'a taking advantage of the easy
grades and curves of ýthat road to offer the
people of this coun.try low freight rates for
carrying their grain to tide water. Then,
when this enterprise was left te the tender
mercies of the present administration. we
muat rernem.ber that we left thear an overflowing treasury to pay for the construction
of it, and it wvas largely paid for out of
surplus revenue. Having, I Vhink, proved
that 'the construction of the National Trhnscontinental Railway has been absolutely
vindicated by the present Government by
their use thereof, it is dîfficult for me to
avoid using a very familiar expression,
which is so satisfying, "I told you se." It
is a great satisfaction to be able, after ten
or twelve years have passed, to make thîs
statement. One of the great things that a
seat in this House is useful for is that if a
gentleman makes a prediction here he may
live some day.to see it actually verified.
The hon. -leader of the Government ini
this House spoke of the wonderful knowledge of. Canada that Germany had ohtained. lu fact, the leader of the Government this year seems te be inclined te
exaggerate a bit. He is su>ch a good

make such statements. He said they knew
more about Canada than his own Government did. That is no compliment te our
country.

DECEÀSED SENATORS.

Hon. Mxf.LOUGHEED-Before the Orders
oi th-e Day are called I igh0t say that
since the last sessioii of Parlianient the
Senate has been cuiled upon to nxeurn the
death of its olde-t mniiber iii ye:irs. anid
likewise in preced-eice, with one exception,
in the mernbership of this Chaxuiiber. 1 refer
to the ]oss throughi deatx of the late
Sir Charles deBoueherville. Boni iii 'May,
1822, lie -vas net far renxoved froi living
out. a century. It i «s a long span of lufe
fromi 1822 to 1915. His ancestry in lis
native province went 'back to the early
davs of the French régimie, ineairlv four
centuries ago He zsaw the advancing clivilizatien of the twentieth century einerge

Only fifty years before his birth the armuies
o! France and Engaland fought oQ the Plaina
of Abraham for the possession of the continent, and during hîs life time, it was not

only possible, -but it was probsable that hie
had often corne in contact with those who
had known Wolfe and Montcalm, and those
who had fought ohl the Plains o! Abraham'.
During his lifetime. hie saw beanrecratie
government make way for self-government:
hie saw our -representative institutions develope froin the bureauciTacy of his early
days te the democratic institutions o! the
present. He was a youth of intelligent years
when Papineau headed the movement in
Quebec and William Lyons McKenzie in
Ontario in 1837, which resulted in the rebellion throughout Canada o! that year.
When lie wvas born the colonial Empire
of Great Britain was but a serica of scattered colonies. dependent entirel * upon the
Mother Country for their support and gevernitnent. and regarded hy the Iînperial
Governiment of tlxose days as an incubus
rather than a sourcep of strengtli to the
Empire.. He lxad reached years of mature
mnanhood before Confederation ivas thoughit
ef. and hie saw Canada emerge froui a
primitive colony to be one o! the greatest
possessions in the Empire, a buttress and
an invaluable support te it at this the most
critical period in its history.
lit is needless for -me to point out the pub>lic services which hie rendered te his native
province during his lifetime. More than 55
years ago hie was a mnber of the Canadian Assernbly; wvas nfterwards Premier of
his native province; was in addition te
being a mniber of fuis Chamber, a legislative councillor of the province cf Quebec,
and during his long lifetime enjoyed the
respect and confidence o! not only the political party to which hie belonged, but te an
equal extent the respect e! those %îvhowere
opposed to himi politically. He hand beenl

lion. Mr. POIRIER-I desire to express
iny sense df -the loss which this Chamber
has sustained in the death of the Hon.
Senattor deBoucherville. lie was a typical
gentleman ef the old school. My ideal of
a perfect gentleman censists- not only in
ancestry, but in being endowed wîth the
best social and religious-virtues, and those
virtues the deceased senater possessed te
an eminent degree. lie was a typical
French gentleman, of a type that played
a large part jn the history of Canada and
which is largely disappearing-not that
virtue is disappearing in the province of
Quebec. but virtue adorned with such
superior miarks of highi breeding is becorning more rare.

There is an almost negligible quantity in

form sulphate of copper and suiphate of
nickel, a very soluble -ait whicli can be
easily dissolved, and in case of rain it is
washed away end carîied into the ground
and al&solutely lest. Afteî this buîning
process, the oie is ioasted and very mucli
reduced in quantity. Finally, in the third
stage, the product of those two operations
is melted in order to separate as rnuch. apossible the iron, silver and copper found
in the oie; and whexn the matte is prepared and in a fit state to be takzen to
New Jersey, I arn infoixned that it contains eighty per cent of pure nickel. Theie
is still twenty per cent of the gangue left
in it, and in New Jersey this twenty jp"r
cent is separated from the pure nickel.
It would be very difficult to have that process carried on in Canada at present, because this last process of reflning requires
the use of suiphate of soda, wvhic'h is a
by-pieduct of the commercial soda that
is produced quite close te the place ini
New Jersey w-here the nickel is refined: so
that in case we Rhould decide to reflue it
here we would have te irnport this suiphate of soda from the United States. A
new alloy called Moneil, afteî the naine
of the president of the cornpany, is beingrnade
in New
Jersey out of oui
nickel.
The alloy consists of leaving
a certain proportion of the copper
with the nickel, and a great dead of this
Moneil is used omrmercially.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is right that
the .Senate
should recognize the sympathy and friendship for Canada -whioli
have been expressed by the Goverinments of
France and Australia, and 1 ain sati-zfied
rthat 1 express the wish eof the Senate that
His Honour the Speaker should assume the
responsibility of duly acknow]edging those
messages whic'h lie ha-s réad to the Senate.
It ig-ht not ble inapproprinte for me at
tehe saine time to make a few observations
as to the reasons why we are occupying the
temlporary quartera in which we lind -ourselves housed this evening. We adjourned
the Senate a littie over two %veeks ago,
having up to that tirne occupied the Senate
Chamber in thèb Parliament buildings. On
Thur9day the Houses of Parliament were
burned. Canada sustained in that fire a
very serious disaster, front which I 'hope
we will happily recover at a very ear]y
period. Trhe catastrophe is one wvhich lias
been noted, in fact, throughout many parts
of the world, a-id the expressions of symnpathy and courtesy -%vhich have proceeded
from different governments and people botli
on this continent and Europe, produce a
very profound feeling- o! satisfaction in
the minds of the pecop]e of Canada.
While the loas which this country has sustained hoth niaterially and sentimentally
in the destruction of the Houses of Parliament may be great, it will be recoverahieat a comparatively early day, yet unfortunately that disaster has been associated
with a more tragic occurrence. Unhappily,
seven lives went out into that shadowy land from which they will flot return,
by reason of the disaster to wvhich we refer.
I feel assured that I express for the Senate

of those who so nobly tried to figlit

Those men are deserving- of the sanie
consideration from the country as the mnen
who to-day are fighting our battles at the

they were doing their duty trying to

th-at some recognition should bie given of
the services that tihese men rendered. 1
wish- to join with the minister iii recognizing the way in which this building has

Depa.rtment of Public Works, but aiso the

SENATE

Vais entirelv novel systemi then we shou]d
do it a-s a Senate and the new systemn
should take the form of a rule of the House.
To say that any senator, whether he be a
member of the Government or not, can
undertake te summon the senators here
'wlhen the Senate is solemnly resolved to
adjourn to a fixel dey beyond that at
'ich 'they are supposed to be euxnmoned,
indica-tes a looseness of view 'with respect
to the dignity and importance ci Parliament, and particularly of this House, that
does flot commend itself te one.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-While
the remarks made by the hon. member
from Halifax are quite .correct, that the
-nember of the Governinent has no more
power here than any independent senator,
it is well understood that the member of
the Governrnent represents the Governinent
here, and when he speaks upon a question
of this kind he speaks for the Governmnent
ms well as for himself. But, apart altogeth-er from that, wh;ether this motion which
was cerried in reference to our adjournprecedent
ruent sbould be considered as &>
is another question altogether. The question has been raised as to whether there is
any power to call the Senate together oblher
than through the action cf the Governinent
of the day. If my hon. friend will consuit
May and the authorities, he will find that
where hie treats of this very question of adjourniment, the reference is entire]y to the
Parliament çqf
Canada and flot Vo any branch
of it. In view of the objection raised 1 took
the trouble te go over iV once or twice and
came to the conclusion that th-e objection
taken 'would be quite correct and proper
if Parliament ha.d adjourned over any particular tiniè. Then Parliament could oitly
be called togethe-r before the expiration of
that tirne by the action of the Governor
General, cf course on the ad-vice of his
advisers. But if my lion. friend wilI read
the authorities carefullyhe will find, according to my jiidgment cf the interpretatien, that either branch cf the legisiature
could niove an adjourniment even with that
clause in iV if it thought proper Vo do so.
My impression, therefore, is that the constitutional aut.horities would bear out the
correctniess cf the position taken by the
Sexiate. Whether that mig-ht be considered
un-British« I arn net riew discussing, but
the war and other circumstances tha.t
'present themselves at the present moment
make the provision for meeting emergencies
particule-rly applicable Vo, the present ime.
Hon. Mr. POWEPR

I'think my [bon. friend,, in considýeriing the
'question, wil] conclude that this is noV an
ordinary time, and that an a-djournment for
a fortniaht migh.t seriously inconvenience
the Govern ment -in taking prooeeding-s in
case of exigencies that mîght arise. Hence
my impression is that under the peculiar circumstances of the present time, the
proviso in the amendment was an admirable
one. WVe eaun discuss here the question
whether iV .should be made a precedent or
noV, but if eircumstances arise similar te
those which exisyted at the time cf the adJourrument, I think it would be well Vo make
some provision in order Vo cali this branch
of the legisiature at au earlier date 'than
the period foi which it had adjourned, if
the exigencies of the times and the circumstances should justify it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Hear,

hear.

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Because ve eau readily understand that events
might occur during an adjournment cf a
fortnight that would neeessitate the calling
together of this branch of the legisla'ture at
an earlier p>eriod in order Vo, deal with any
important question that night possibly
arise.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I quite agree with
the hon. gentleman that occasions might
arise uecessitating an early cali cf this
House durinýg the a'djourniment cf theé
House, and I think that all facilities should
be given Vo the Government se that this
House .may resurne its sittings aV any time.
But I ag-ree with the suggestion cf the hon.
gentleman fromn De Lorimier that it would
be proper te appoint a small cernrittee for
Vhe purpese cf devising Vhe hest means cf
achieviug the objeet. As presently advised I amn under. the impression that we
v'illl require te amend eue cf the rules cf
this Hanse, and therefore, I think the suggestion that wasmrade cf appeiuting a coinmittee is quite proper.
Hon. Mir. CLORAN-I see a 'way out cf
the difficulty-which is net a very great
difficuliy-that would net necessiVate the
issue cf anythiug 'like this. The Senate is

ALIEN ENFIMIES

IN CIVIL SERVICE,
ETC.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Befere the Orders cf
the. Day are proceeded -with, on behalf of a

large section cf the people cf this count.ry,
and smre in very high position, I wish te
direct the attention cf the *Gevernment te
a coming event ini the very near future.
We have had considerable discussion about
Ger-mani activity in Can-ada, and possibly
the activity cf alien enemies in Governinent
positions. We hope that such activaties
and influence wHI 1;é wiped out as fast as,
possible. On the day of the burning of the
Parliament buildings an employee in the
bran ch cf the peat. office in the Union Bank
building, declared bis satisfaction with the
destruction cf the P.arliament buildings.
That is one cas.
Then right here in constructing this Chamber, I asked the policeman, "Afe there any Germans" around.P"
*He replied. - Yes, there are four cf thein,
skilled meohanics." I was confronted by
the contracter and asked what fault I had
te find. I said I had ne fault to find, but
I thought that there were .men right ber.
at the pressent momnent who were Germans.
He said, "They are not German Ca.nadians;
they are German Americans." That made
it aIl tihe worse. The peint I want to
direct the Government's, attention te is
this: there is coming froin a foreigu country an orchestra ef German enrgin and
largely of Germen composition. No-w, frein
high quartera down te lo'w quartera protesta have been entered against the bringing
in of that body of German American musiclans. I ask the Governinent if they will take
steps te prevent anything frein scandalizing the public. that -ls scanduized by expressions cf opinion in the public press.
.The enly party that can interfere with this
intrusion cf Germans inte Canada is the
Government of the day, thre Federal Gev-

erninent through its -Secretary of State. We
do. net hate the Germans, but we do net
want te be bothered with their presence in
aur midst in the present stress of cireuinstances, that is ail. On ýbehalf of a la.rge
section cf the public, if not ail those in
high places and efficiaI places, I ask the
Governient te have this thing put an end
te.

&Te plaoed.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-There la only one
opinion as to the ,necessity of daing evrrytbing possible in order ta nrelp the Empire
in*lie great struggle which is being carried
an. J1 may say without exaggerationi that
there in <'nly one sentiment on that question. It is true that there are a few exceptions, but very few, and perhaps we attach
tao muci importance ta them. As ta the
prolongation of the life af Parliament there
may,.be, and there are differences of opinion. I arn not ready ta say that the members af this Hanse, whether >ndividually or
collectively, should oppose the prolongation
or extension of the term cf tbis Parliament.
but I wish ta formulate or sum up in a
f ew wards the objections which can be
made againet the proposed extension. In
order. ta satisiy my canspicnce and.judgment-'and in order ta be able ta say later
an, perhaps, what I thmnk *ould be proper anxd in order ta afford the hon. leader
an apportunity ta meet those objections.
The objections ara:
*1. There is ne doubt -that any extension
of the term of Parliament is a derogation
from our constitution, a violation af the
letter and af the spirit ai the Federal Act
and the best proof that 'i in se, is the necessity af applying ta the Imperial Parliament in order ta make it legal.
S. The intervention ai the Imperial Parliament is a dangerous precedent which
may ho nsed and abused for party purpases
and which should be justified by lhe gravent
ciroumstances and ressens; and it must be

8ENATE

sure that the object sought for will be
attained.
3. The uncertainty cencarning the cessation-of hostilities makes it difficuit, if not
impossible, te fix a date for the axpiry of
that extension.
4. One year is mentioned, bacausa it is
supposed that the war will then be ovar.
But if it should not *than have caed, it is
intended, I suppose, te ranaw the applicatien te the Imperial Government for another year, and. even more. It is within
tha range cf possibilitias that this war
mnay ha followed by-anothar, if net genaral.
at least partial, in which England will be
angaged, and it may taka saverai years
baf ore a definite traaty ef peace is concluded.
5. It cannot be said that elections weuld
interfara sariously with the conduct cf the
war, and, anyhow, if the elactions take
place within the dalay of one yaar asked
for, the conditions rnay be worsa than they
are now, and what then about the practical
affect cf the extension cf termi asked for,
wha-t will become of the resens given fer
resortîng te such an extraerdinary measure?

6. Our constitution erititles the people of
ithis country te pass judgmant every fiva
vears, upon the deeds cf its rapresentatives.
The prolongation cf the terîn of Parliament
will deprive them ef that right.
7. That prolongation will continue te deaprive the diffarent provinces cf Canada of
the representatien te which they are entitlad
in virtue cf the last cansus, and cf the law
passed te giva affect te that census and if
ever theie was a tirne when they sheuld be
fully represented, it is now. It cannot be
denied that this abnormal state cf affaîrs
is centrary te the constitution and cannot
be continued without jeopardizîng the constitution and'the rights cf the people be.
cause somne mermbers of the Oocvernment and
of the 'House have bean elected te oppose
the war -policy cf the Governmant. It is
a matter of surprise te iiie that the great
provinces of the West, which are se jealous
of their rights, do net assert themnselves-in
a more forcible way, because generally.
those great provinces do net hesitata te say
what they think in the interests cf the
people.
Net only in the Blouse cf Gommons, but
aven in the Government, the- people cf
Canada are net represented in accerdance
with the latter and the spirit cf the constitution, and the sooner an end is put te such
an irragular situation the bettar it will be.
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

Notwithstanding the above objections if I
decide to vote in favour of the -resolution,
it will be because of the unanimous vote of
the House of Gommons, of the expression
of public opinion and on the express condition that the delay or ticket of leave asked
for is for one year and not more. When
,a ticket of leave is granted te a prisoner it
ion the condition that he will behave
weIL. I hope the Government will act accordijigly.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I quite agree with the
resolution placed on the table of the House
by the hon. leader. I think it expresses
public opinion in this -country from ône
end te the other. I presume the Gcvernment is not averse te taking another year.
When a man has a law-suit and is not
confident of succese, he is always willing
te have it postponed for a year; therefore
the Government is quite willing te accept
an extension of time. 1 might say that the
province from which I corne, and ail the
western provinces, have more te lose by
thus proposition than any of the eastern
provinces, because we .would be entitled, if
a general election were held at the presnt
time, te an increase of 27 members in -the
House of Gommons. There are issues in
regard to trade matters that we would like
to see disposed of, but there is a spirit of
patriotiam ail ever the country, and when
we consider that we have placed about
2MO,00O or more soldiers under arma, and
furnished them with, supplies, it goes to
show that the people -have taken the war
in earnest. The people ef Alberta have net
waved the fiag as much as the people in
the eastern provinces, but when it cornes
te placing men in the field te fight the
battllee of the Empire, Alîberta cornes first
and Saskatchewan second. We are quite
willing the extension cf the terni of Parliament àbould, be granted, but I should
like te give the Government a littie advice.
and I hope my hon. friend will convey it
te hîs -friends-it is this, that the Gevernment, who do n7ot want te plunge the
country into an election, should understand that the people out West, though
deeply interested in free wheat and trade
conditions, are willing te waive ail that
for the puirpose cf assisting in prosecuting
this war te a successful issue. At the samne
time, their eyes are -open and their ears
are netclosed,- and .they understand the
way things àre being conducted. politicaliy;
the -peeple, net eonly of oe party but cf
beth, are taking stock of that, -and I think

FEBRUARY 10, 1916

it is pretty nearly tirne tohat the objectionable methods cf the Milîtia Department
should be put an end te. You will find a
liue cf people at the departrnent looking
fer patronage. Those people are patriots,
but they would like te make 400 per cent
profit on 'the mnanufacture cf war munitions.
1 think the Government sheuld do something te curtail the profits. This is a war
cf men, munitions and meney, and every
dollar thmat we can save te the Empire in
this country at the present tirne rnay be
o! assistance a little later on. because it is
the last dollar that is going te win. the war.
There is ne question about that. Why
sheuld we charge the -Mother Coun'try large
aiiîeunts for munitions? They are being
heavily taxed iii England, and why sheuld
we charge them $5 for a shell'-which only
cost $ý1te manufacture.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-lt is the inmpression cf
nîiany people that the men manufacturing
shelîs and uniforms are making exorbitant
profits, and I think, the Governnent should
take some step te see that contractora receive a legitimate return only. The department should endeavour te make the money
go as far as possible. My hion. friend says
we niay have te grant another extension. 1
thiink we will. 'The present conflict is like
the Civil War between the North and Soutl.

nîly lien1. friend that lie aud his friends,
tîte inenbers cf the Govertinient, should
see te 'it that every dollar is properly expended. Anether very important question
thiat w'ill coine up after the war is over
will be what we are going te do with all
those nien who are now under arins. We
will require a few cf those dollars in our
pockets when 'the- war is over and a lot
o! those nien will be coming -back who will
have te be looked after end placed in a
position te earn a living for themselves and
their families. That is something which
will have te be worked eut by the Goveriment, and 1 hope they will take it inito

serions considera-tion. At the sarne time
I would wsggest that there should be less
politics in the conduet of public affairsz.
1 hope iiow we have got io the end of it.
Under ordinary conditions the two politioal parties would 'have had to fight their
issues on 'the hustings, but now we have
goi rid of that, and my hion. friends should,
therefo>re, drop ail politic's. It does net
matter what a 'man's polities aire, if lie is
willing 'to tender atinorereasonable figures
than his neighbour hie should get a contraet. But ýhat lias 1not been the experience thus far, and 1 speak f-rom knowledg-z
of these matters. Young fcllows have been
taken in -as lieutenants and captains, and
this, that and tlie other thing, throngl
political pull, who are nôt fit to lead men
in the field, and 1 understand that they
neyer go to the field. That sort of thing
onght to ýbe stopped-lieutcnants, ehaplains', colonels, and ail the res-t ef it-and
political pull shonld bceuct ont en'tirely.
In the -selection of officers, in the seleetion
of physicians, in the seleetion of everv
oficer, and the giving of contracta for
everything next year, I hope the Goveruiment will dtrop politics en'birely so that we
can get the best possible ret.urn for ou r
dollars, because we will need every dollar
in this country until this war is over, and
we cannot afford te fatten a lot of people
at the expense of the country a-t large.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I rise te point ont

there is ne power on earth that can force
that Governiment to go to the country in

of this country under this -message? And
there is not the siighltest doubt that our

every advantage of this extension, and if

British authorities, that the British House,
à-respective of party, wili put in the Bill

Liberal party will be safeguarded and protected. I have flot the slightest doubt. o!
it; they have done it before; thiey have
oh.anged ýrnessa!ges that have been sent over
te the Iraperial House for approval or
adoption. I huld and I state that if the
Liberal party want to çirotect themselves it is too late new to do it
here, but they can stili do it on
the floor of the British House of Comrions;
and then the present Government will have
no excuse to go te, the country and say,
"«Oh, the Grits, the Liberals, forced an
election; they would not grant us an extension unless under certain conditions
that we would not accept and therefore wve
corne before you." The leaderof the Opposition ini the House of Commons distinctly
told the leader of the Governiment and the
House o! Gommons that hie would flot lie a
party to sucli a scheme; that hie would notbe a party to give the Government a chance
to go to the country and say, " Oh, the disloyal Grits would not give us an extension
and they have forced us to the country."
I go one step further and say that notwithstanding ail those dangers which 1 have
pointed eut to this House and to the country I shall vote for the extension, but in

that the Governiinent, in niy humble opinion,

those who clsniour more loudly, are they

does flot want, as it *hias said, to hold an

takes them three or four or five davs to
get down here. Now, what happens? We
will say the Senate bas adjourned for three
weeks; à crisis arises inx par]iamentaxy
affairs necessitating the immediate calling
of the Senate. What is going to happenP
The -leader of the Goverrument in.strudts
the clerk to wire the niem1bers from Prince
Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, the Yukon, to be on hand in 48 or
24 hours. Now, that is a matter of physical
impossibility. The resuit will be that if
the Senate is called by telegram to be present within 48 hours or three days these
members etaniot be here, for it takes five
days if not more of travel froni Prince
Edward Island here, two or three days from
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, ifive oýr
six days from Victoria, British Columnbia
and the Yukon. As the bon. senator fromn
Portage la Prairie says, that would be
taking an unfair advantage of the memibers of this House. The position taken by
the hon. member is based on justice to the
members of this House and to the people.
Canada is too vast for our niembers to be
called together on a telegram, and as the
hon. member from Portage la Prairie said,
a snap verdict might be obtained owing to
the absence of those senators from far distant provinces. Hence I think the position
taken by him is a logical one whichi 1 lope
will be maintained as long as Nve are in
the majorîty; but I fear that if the Government is al;lowed to have its way, we wiIl
not be in the inajority very long.

that he proposes.
Hon. Mr. EDWVARDS-It seems to me
that this is a tetupest in a teapot. The old,
practice used to be that the leader of the
8-5
REVISED

Government took the responsibilitv of movîng adjournments. I have always been
opposed, and ami stili opposed, to the
practice of private members mnoving adjournments.
When this matter was dincussed a few days ago, there seemed to be
doubt in the minds of some gentlemen as
to who should have authority ta send the
telegranis. Well, we ail know right well
eniough that so far as oenvening Parliament is conceried., àt is 1through tlhe
instrumentality of the Governor General;
but at whose instance? At the instancc
of the Government of the day; lie is siniply
the mouthpiece; he speaks for the Goveriiment of -the day, and if lion. gentlenien
think that *he should do it on the occasion
of adjournments, 'lie w'ill simply do At again
it the instance of the Government. I think
ià is shorter, more concise and just as wel]
that -the leader of the House do it himself.
and I can 1see nothing wrong in it.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Tlie Government doez
not summon this House by telegramn.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-That may be. As
te whether there should be such a provision under the existing peouliar circumstances, I certainly think there should lie.
If the Senate adjourns for some two or
three weeks, there should be a proviso
that in case of an emergency it should be
called before the expiration of the adjournment. The only question which arises is.
who should send the telegranis? It ivîll
be at the instance of the Government undc'r
any circumstances, and I cannot see ver '\
much difference whether the Governor
General or the leader of this House is used.
Bo far as this immediate adjourniment i-i
Concernied, I do not takze any stock in the
arguments of *hon. gentlemen that in the
absence of some members living a lonz
distance from the capital, an advantage
may be Jaken. As the adjournmrent ivill
be onîy for a week's timc, nobody is goiii,to journey to the other -end of Canada
simply for the pleasure of going there and
returning immediately.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-That is his busines-.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-It m.ay be his
business, but that is what would happen.
If there is to be a committee appointed
to say who should send this telegram, let
us defer that to some other occasion, *but
let us to-day settle this question and have
the adjournment if hon. gentlemen want
it. I live in tihe ciapital, end an neyer

other, but I think that our leader should
mave 'the adjournment; and I -%ill say that
I have absolute confidence that on no
occasion wilI hie take advantage of the
Senate and send telegrams with the abject
of getting a snap verdict on any question.
Several hon.'GENTLEMEN-Na, no.
Hon. Mr,. WATSON-I have every faith
and confidence in the leader of this House,
and I do not -think for one moment that
he would take the advantage that has heen
suggested; but you are adopting a principle and are going ta make a precedent..
If you do it now, why should yau not do
it again' Until the Senate makes soe
ride by which the Senate may be c-al]ed
in sorne other way, I say we should not depart from the aid standing praotice. I have
every confidence in the leader af this House
and I decidedly abject to the way my hion.
friend bas put ,the case before the House.
Speaking - for myself, this is nat a party
matter at ail, and I arn glad that members
an bath sides af the Hanse agaree with me
in thinking that we ehould nat depart from
the old rnethed of calling this House; I
do nlot think that we should put it in the
hands of any mani ta eall the Senate tagether by telegram. I arn prepared ta have
an adjournment long enough ta go home,
but I do nlot think we ought to leave here
with the uriderstanding that Parliament can
be called t 'ogether on the suggestion of any
member until some rule is adopted by this
Hanse definirig how the Senate can be called.
Hon. Mr. MITCHEL-I do not think a
cammittee could say how we are ta be called
back here. Thè leader of the Government
could sirnplify the matter hy ha-ving the
Governor General recaîl us in the usual
way.
1 do nat agree with my hion. friend
from St. John that we should -sit here
whether we have business or not. I amn
willing ta vote for the motion ta adjourn
if the leader and the Governm«ent are satisfied. It is a pity ta keep 80 or 90 men sitting here even ta do the work that we have
been doing this week, when I arn sure they
could do better work at home, WOTking for
the patriotic fund, in wvhich I amn sure rny
lion. friend frorn St. John (Hlon. Mr.
Daniel) is interested Tiha't would be beftter
thia.n sitting here ýand looking tat eacih
othex. Surely the 'leader of the Govemnme~nt can lot us out of this tlhing tand nvot
change the precedent. Wle have been ad
journuingAfir many yeairs in the bdd way,
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS.

and 'there is no reason why we shouid
change.
Hon. '-%r. RATZ-As regards the possibility of the rider be.ing used ta ob-bad i a sm~p
verdict I arn quite willing to trust the
leader of the Government. I do not believe
hie has any intention of doing such a thing.
But I do nlot approve of this rider te the
resolution. If the country la in such a condition that it'might be probable or evein
possible that we would have to be cafled
back by telegraui within a week or ten
days' time. then I tbdnk that this Heuse
should remain here, and even if there
îs nothing to be done we will be here
ready to do anything which may arise.
We are paid by the country, and we ail
know that the Senate has been made a
laug-hing stock all over

has been cast into my face as well as into
the faces of other niembers of this Hoeuse,
"Oh, you are going to Ottawa, but you
will be back in a day or twa." If it is only
a imatter of a week's. adjoulrinaent. 1
think it is far better, if the Governrnent
is nlot positively sure we will not be required, that we should stay here, and then
we will have nothing to fear.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE: I was just about
to say in explanation of my position on this
question, that when the proposal was first
made, it seemed ta be rather a dangerous
innovation, the introduction of what înight
be called a very dangerous principle and
precedent. Had it beer predicated upon
the exigencies af the occasion, this being
a war session, and an announcement made
that it would not be regarded as a precedent, I would have less reluctance ta assent
ta it. I have nlot had time ta look up the
authorities on the question, but froin niw
casual reading and frorn what I know of
constitutional Governments, it did seern
ta me rather a strange innovation, and
therefore I looked upon it with a littie susIt seerned ta rn( a proposai
picion.
which, if continued at the present tirne
without any safeguarding by explanation
that it was in view of the exigencies af the
present session, which is a war session
and therefore exceptional, that this was
done, a bad precedent would be estahlished. If it had been predicated in the
way I suggest I would have less reluctance
ta agree ta it, but in view of the f act that
it was nat, and as I have not had time ta
look up the history of the British Parlis-

FEBRUARY il, 1916

ment, on this question, I do flot feel like
voting for it. I frankly confess that I rather
agree with the point raised by the hon.
gentleman fronti Prince Albert, and I have
always thought that the Government should
take the responsibility of rnoving the adjourrnent of the House. .It seems to me
that it is neither the duty nor the privilege
of a private member to do so. It is very
rnuch like the introduction of a Bill which
carnies with it rnoney. obligations.
The
Governnient should take the responsibility
of it. In this case it seerns to me there is
a double justification for it, because we
have a representative of the Governmnent
îhere w.ho alone knows the inner hi-sto<y of
what is going on, and therefore it will
naturally be ac-umced that wlien lie made
the statemnent to the House it was accepted
as what was justîfied by the circumnstances
and situation at the time, but wvhen it
cornes froi a private member we do not
know whether it is anything beyond the
natural tendency that members have, since
transportation has becorne s0 easy, to corne
down here and work for a day or two and
then go home ag-ain. It is a practice which
has become very common of late, and is
flot too creditable to the Parliament of
Canada, or ikely to be conducive to the
best interests of the country.
We should not adjourn too frequently. I
do not feel like cornritting myseif to what
I thought was a dangerous precedent. It
is something that rnight lead to great abuse
if it could be quoted hereafter as a precedent.
Hon. Mn. LOUGHEED-May I say a
word in explanation of the argument-I
may say At is an argument-b hion, gentlemen that the Government should niake the
motion to adjouru. Hon, gentlemen should
consider the situation in this way: that
upon this question of adjournment there
invariably is a very great diversity of
opinion. It is entirely immaterial to the
Government, if there be no business before
the House, and it seems to me that the
Governent should not take the initiative
in suggesting the adjournmnent, when the
(iovernment is flot concernied whether there
is an adjourniment or not. The practice
lias been for the mover of the adjournment,
or for some merrbers of the House to ask
the leader of the House if the Government
will approve of an adjournrnent, and they
invariably have made the motion mith the
concurrence of the Government. It seerna
to me that that is a v'ery satisfactory posiS-5bj

tion to take upon this question; that is to
say, if there is a group of memibens in this
House who are desîrous of securing an
adjournment, that they cati make a motion
to adjourn subject to the approval of the
Government to that adjournment. That is
the practice we have folloNved and it seems
to me that it is not productive of any injurious' resuits.
.Hon. Mr. WATSON-Supposing you adopt
thîs principle and the Senate should surprise the Government by adjourning whlen
we had business to do.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-You have misunderstood my position. It is that the
adjournment should not be made without.
the concurrence of the Government, and
that practice has been followed for somne
years. 1 am unaware of any such motion
having been carried against the wishes of
the Government. Invariably the wishes of
the Governrnent have been consulted, and
I take it to be the case in thîs matter.
May 1 funther- illustrate, in vindication of
the position which I have taken that I
should not move the adjournment, that a
great number of the fniends of the Government on this aide are opposed to the adjournrnent and thenefore lion. gentlemen
cannot veny well expect me to force a
motion upon my own friends against their
wîsh. I place myself entirely in the hands
of the House on that subject, so long as the
motion for adjournrnent is made subject to
the concurrence of the Government.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The hion. leader of
the House sais there is no precedent where
the Huse voted against the wish of the
Government. I arn only thinteen years in
this bouse, but I remember several occasions when the late leader of the House, the
hon. Secretary of State, Sir ]Richard Scott,
decidedly opposed adjournments, and the
Liberal party voted him down, and the lion.
gentleman from De Lorimier was christened
-Minister of Adjournmnents.
The lion.

THE SENATE.
Wednesday, February 16, 1916.
The SPEAKER took the Chair at Three
o'clock.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
THE LATE SENATOR YOTJNG.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Before we proceed with the Orders of the Day, it is niy
sad and regrettable duty to mnake mention
this afternoon of the death yesterday of
our late colleague, Senator Young, of Manitoba. As I approached this building this
morning, and saw, for the first time, the
flag flying at hall mast, ont of respect for
the memory of our departed colleague, I
was impressed with that quotation:
What shadows we are and what shadows we
purnue.
I have been called upon so frequently
within the last couple of years to perforni

a duty similar to that which I arn endeavcuring to discharge this afternoon,
that the death of Senator Young bas borne
in upon my mind the f utility and the vanity cf our strivings, and our differences and
ambitions. Any expressions of mine would
but feebly voice the deep regret which is
feit by ail bis fellcws in the loss which we
have sustained througb the death of Senator
Young.
Durimg the last session of Parliament, hie
was wjth us ccntributing valuable services
in ail the duties wbicb he assumed, but
this session only his vacant seat and his
mnemory remain with us.
He was orie cf the pioneers of bis adopted province, Manitoba. He settled there
when the boundless plains of the West
were uncultivated and unsettled and lived
long enougb to see it one of the great
granaries cf the Empire. He was actively
identified with not only the agricultural
but the commercial intereats cf, the province, to which hie contribut-ed much. For
some years he cccupied a seat in the Legislature cf Manitoba, and while its Speaker,
was one of its most popular presiding
oificers.
He was appointed to the Senate cf Canada in 1900, and brought to this Chamber a
wide experience and knowledge cf parliamentary procedure and practice. He had a
large lund cf common sense and his experience of public life gained in the province from wbicb he came, proved a valuable asset in the -deliberations cf this
Chamber. The members of the Senate flot
only honoured himi but bonoured theniselves in appointing bim chairman of several cf their committees, more notably the
Railway Committee, of which hie was the
chairman at the tume cf his death. During
the whole pericd cf his membership of this
Chamber hie was one cf the most active
and valuable cf its members and in bis
death we have sustained a loss which it
wvill be difficult to repair.
He probably enjcyed a greater measure
cf popularity amcngst bis fellow senators
than any other member cf this Chamber.
He possessed the peculiar cbarm cf personality which appealed to ail wbb met
him and particularly to those who knew
bum best.
Political lines did not bound ner lumit
the friendsbips which he made, but cf bim
it might truly be said, that his polýtical
opponents appreciated and valued his

that time, a considerable arnaunit of the
leg-isiatian ai the Dominion was drafted
in a way that camniended itself ta the people oi the West, and those wha were responsible for this legisiation adapted it ta
the requirements ai the western country.
Particularly in regard ta the iraming of
the Grain Act and the formation of the
Railway Commission, the advice af Senator Yaung was welcomed by -thase who
had the authority for briuging those measures befare the country, and I cau say

Hon. Mr. Young I found that he was a

hie meant, and what le pramised he accoznplished. In this Hause, as las beeu
properly said by the two hon, gentlemen
who spoke befare me, le acquired the same
reputation that he had lu the local Legislature of Manitoba, that ai being a man ai

that wheu he sat iu the Chair here lu Cornrnit.tee ai the Wbole le could maintain

exist. It is imaginary because the adherents
of the Salvation Army are largely of the
very poorest class. Frequently they are
brought in for the purpose of charity, and
I can say that we take a great deal for
granted for them. We ought to extend our
charity as far as possilxle, because I remember the words of the Divine Founder of
Christianity , -"Bytheir works ye shall know
them." I believe they do work that no other
church has done or can do, and for that
reason I shall gladly -support the Bill,
provided that objectionable clause is eliminated reducing the management.
The
broader the management the better the institution which is under the control o! individuals. For that reason I admire the
PZesbyterian Church, because 1 suppose to
some extent I am a democrat, but with
regard to the character and record of the
Salvation Army we can do a great deal
to assist themn in their very laudable work
in the community.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-What is meant by
the annual value o! the real esae Does
it mean an income of $50,000 or that the
value of the property would be $50,000?
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I take
it to be the annual value of the property.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL-It wouid be the rentai
value.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-It nmust be the
rentai value.
When I heard the hon.
gentleman mention $50,000 in any one province, I knew it must be rentail value, because ini the city of Montreal they have
property which I know to be worth. a quarter of a million. There is no other institution more worthy to !be encouraged than
the 6alvation Army of Montreal.
1 know
of the good work they are doing- ail the
time, and anything they can possibly do
in the same line for poor people will be
a very great benefit. to the conimunity as
it has been in tihe past.
As the hon.
gentlemnan from Halifax has just said, they
look after a class of people which apparently no church is looking after.
They
are the c.losest to niy church of any I know
of in looking a!lter the poor people.
It
would be a pity to discourage the organization which was started by 'General Booth,
whieh wvas essentially based on the relief
of poverty, which is the very thing that
made the niovement seo strong with the
people, beoause the Salvation Army are ail
poor people. If they are to become, like.
Hon. Mr. ]ROCHE.

)ther organizations, large owners of property, they will not do much good, because we know the founder of the Christian
faith did not have a place whereon to lay
his head. Poverty helped -the organization.
1 have seen it at work in Glasgow, and I
witnessed the very good work it was doing,
but it always worked as a poor organization.
Their firs-t appeal to the people was that
they were poor. If they are in any way
departing from that. as the hon, gentleman
said just now, in the intereat of the institution itself, they should be debarred from
the temptation o! acquiring a dot of property.
The acquisition of property has
drawn people away from such work as this
organization has been doing.
In France,
for instance, when weaith accumulated, the
people turned against the church. on accounit of ita weaith, and would not contribute to its maintenance, so much so that
the Government of the day had to impose
a tax for the support of the church, and
paid. both the priests and bishops an annuai stipend.
The isame thing applies to
the Established Church of England. When
they were wealthy the people did flot go to
them, as freely as they do now.
I think
the Sa.lvation Anny should be encouraged,
as much as possible, to keep up the good
work they have been daing since General
Booth started the organization, and to follow the same uines and- not depart froni
them. Diiring thle time General Booth was
at the head of the organivation, I do not
remember any legialation coming up froni
that body.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE IBOWELL-It is
on the statute-book.
Hon. MrL.CASGRAIN-Then -se much the
better. I only rose to ask a-bout the $50,000.
I think it is an annual Ïncome, whicli
%vould be the amount of revenue if they
owned a million dollars worth o! property.
Hon. Sir 'MACKENZIE BOWELL-Upon
reflection 1 think the hon. gentleman is
rigaht.

patent lapsed througb no fault of the patentee where bardships would be impoeed
if relief were not granted. I notifled the
solicitor that it would be bis duty to appear
before the committee and give valid reasons
for the non-payrnent of fees to satisfy the
comrnittee tbat the Bill sbould be passed.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I think the lion.

any member of this House who takes
charge of a Bill. The second reading is
the stage at which. some explanation ought
to be given as te the nature of the Bill and
why it is asked for, so that it will then be
in the possession of senators; but if, on
the other band, a rnere bald motion is made
that the Bill !be read a second tirne, and
the next motion after that is that it be sent to
the Private Bills Oommittee, very few rnernbers of -this House will be in that cornimittee room wben the evidence is takeii
in regard to the Bill. Then it is reported
back from the committee, and the next
motion is either for the third reading of
the Bill or that -the report of the cornrittee
be concurred in. No more explanation is
given to the House regarding tbe Bill than
there was in the first instance. Now, that

in- the impression that the committee
miglit adjust the situation and make it
more comfortable than the principle of the
Bill -alone permits it to be. There is nothing whatever in this Bill, or in sny other
patent Bill which cornes before this House,
exoept the principle of renewal. The hon.
gentleman points out that there is a clause
in this Bill which enables any one who has
undertaken te use this device ini the in-i
terirn, that is, between th-o date o! expiry
and this, to continue te use it.- I do net
know what opportunity there may have been
for that. It is true that there ls sucli a provision in every patent which. cames before
this Houe. But to rny mind that is no
reason wvhy the Hou se should reinstate a
patent. The House is not here te protect
the second individual who wants te be
protect.ed by it any more than the first;
the question is whether we should reinstate and put back the patent in the hande
o! the inventor or leave it te the public.
It is known te hon. gentlemen that in some
cases of this kind the paten.tee neyer made
use of bis patent. It had expired, and te
expiry was for more than a year--considerably more in one case. Borne company lied taken it up te develop it, and

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Why should they

Hon. Sir LYMAN JONES--They did not

they could get an improvement that would
be an improvernent on a dead patent,
it would be no use. I have had forty years'
experience of patente and know something
of the subject. What doe a patent give
te a man in Canada? It gives hirn a
right to control his invention, if hie can
establish it in the court. The reinstating
of this patent in no sense whatever transfers to the individual the right tae c ontrol
it. He gets the right te control.it if the
courts of Canada will uphold hîrn.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-What, more do you

Han. Mr. BOYER-I arn very glad my
hon. friend bas brought up this question.
Speaking an this disastrous fire in another
House, a member of Parîxament said that
the lootinga that nig-ht wa-- disastrous. We
ought ta take up the motion of niy hon.
friend from Montreal and say ta the world
at large, as far as the employees of the
Senate are concerned, they did their duty
nably and well, and I think a substantial
reward should be given ta themn as an
encouragement for the future and an expression ai gratitude froin the Senate. My
flrst fear when 1 learned of the fire in
Ottawa, was that our valuable collection
of portraits af men that have helped ta lay
the foundatians ai the Dominion had been
lost, and great was my delight when I saw
that each and every one of these great
men's partraits, which cannot be replaced,
had been saved, and remain the property
of the country. I regret very much the
destruction ai the painting in the Railway
Committee roomn of the bouse ai Commans, entitled -"The Fathers of Confederation." In that picture we liad the portraits
of ail the great Canadians who, from 1865 ta
1876, helped ta found the Dominion ai Canada. They were lifelike portraits. Unfortunatelv there is no duplicate ai the picture, and I arn sorry ta *say that it is last
for ever. The group wa aszeiubled iii the
illustrious aid Parliament bouse that stood
on the rock in Quebec. In the distance you
had the noble St. Lawrence and acrass the
river the fortresses af Lévis, and seated at
the table were such men as have g-iven us
the constitution we now enjoy. That picture has been last ta the country. Too little
care is taken in this country ai aur record
ai deeds ai valour. We should inscribe in
our Minutes the noble deeds dane by the
small staff ai the &nate. We .should ýIo

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I quite join with
my hion. friend f'rom Montreal who has
bîought this matter up in the appreciation
which he has expressed of the services
rendered by the Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod and other employees of the
Senate. I was present on that occasion
and wit.nessed what they accomplished. As
to any tangible recognition which we can
-ive to the officers and employees of the
Senate for their service on that occasion, I
cannot say anything at the moment, but I
shall be very glad to act upon the suggestion of the hon. gentleman from Montreal,
and direct the attention of the Chairman
of the Internai Economy Committee, when
bie returns to Ottawa, to the expressions of
appreciation which we have heard this
afternoon, and the desirability of some
recognition beîng given to the officers and
employees of thé Senate for their services
on tbe occasion referred to.

we believed we were scarcely able to force

who discovered that there were unclaimed

they were dealing. Their original account
had been closed: subsequently they opened
accounts in the same banks in which
money was standing to their credit. In one
bank, to my linowledge, no mention was
made to them that they had money standing to their credit, although they had been
dealing there for years, until the list of unclaimed balances was published. Then one
of the parties dernanded his money and of
course got it. I mnerely cite that as an

could understand why if there is no dlaimant or owner for a money balance it should
be deait with otherwise than the law provides for real or personal property for
which. no claimant or owner appears. In
the latter case the property is escheated to
the Crown and in nîy judgment the unclaimed balance ou-ght to be treated on
exactly the saine principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I will not express any opinion on the motion made by
the hon. gentleman fromn Grandville until
the matter comes up regularly on the production of the correspondence. I only rise
to make this remark, that some hon. gentleman has spoken of a bank having knowledgé of a special deposit lying idie for

and the party would not be notified by the
bank that he hiad a bagatelle, a lew dollars
or a few cents, remaining of an account
that he had neglected to close. There should
be more precision in the affirmation that
the bank knew that a certain client had a
deposit that he seemed to have forgotten

amusing.

British Columbia considers this service necessary should be sufficient, and yet it la submitted to the Judgment of some other mndlvidual ln whose opinion nmre eastern Interest

should know better than any one else what ia

The Custome Act does flot prescribe any penalty against shipping Canadian goods through
a foreign port. neither does it provide that
this shall fot be done. It only states that
transhipment must be done under the inspection of a customs oflicer. Ha. the Customs Department any right to refuse the free entry of
these goods Into Canada? If the Customae Department thinks the transhipment should be
supervised by one of their officers it la up to it
to appoint hlm, otherwise there la nothing ta

The Globe adds, as a note at the end of
the article, that it has been given to understand that neither the railways nor the
officers of the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association opposed the granting of this
right ta British Columbhia, and they ask the
'question, "IVho, then, stands -behind the
Minister of Customs in refusing it?" The
mnatter was also taken up in Deceinber by
a paper called Industrial Canada. In that
article they say, in part:

of Vaucouver prohibited the admission of Canadian goods arriving by sa If they have passed

They then point out that the distance

from Vancouver to, Halifax

is 1,450 miles

greater than from Vancouver to New York;
that New York is nearer to the great manufacturing centres of Eastern Canada, that
Hamilton is 655 miles nearer to N&ew York
than it is to Halifax. They further point ont
that this request for the appointment of a
customs officiai te clear goods at another
port, to pass goods through in bond, is
nothing new, inasmuch as it ie done at the
present time in Vancouver. The United
States maintain an officer there for the
,purpoee of dealing with tea and other products coming fromn Japan which. are carried through in bond by the Ganadian
Pacifie Railway, and handed over again ini

SENATE

*Hon. Mr. DANIEL-I have no serious
objection to its going to the Private Bis
Committee, but if the Bill authorizes this
corporation to engage in any matter of
business in connection with their affairs,
I think it would be better to refer the Bull
te the Oommittee on *Banking and Coinnierce.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-Even suppesing it
is a matter of business, it is not a Bill for
the Banking, and Commerce Committee.
There is nô banking and commerce connected with it in any shape or form.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-1 can Only refer to
the general practice of the Senate since 1
have been here, that Bis of this character
invariably go to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. EDhWARDS-A great mistake
is made on that very subject, in my humble
opinion. The previous Bill was also referred to the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee although it is not for banking and
commerce, but a private Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANtLEL-I amn stating the
practice cf the House.
Hon. Mfr. EDWARDXS-The practice cf the
House in many instances is wrong.

that knowiedge spread throughout the Dominion. Since bringing up the subject 1
have been in receipt of correspondence
frein severai parts of 'the iDominion and the
United States. One corning from the United States ie signed "A friend of Canada."
He tells me flot to put ail the biamne on
the guards. I did not put the blame on
the guards, but this friend of Canada says
there are others outaide of the camp, citizens of New Brunswick, who are worse
traitors, who are doing ail they can to
have the enemy evade the supervision of
our military authorities. 1 arn at liberty
now to say -that if the Minister of Militia,
or of any department cf the Governinent
would like to have the naines of the men
who are parties to this betrayal of the interests of Canada and the Empire I shall
give thein. I arn not at liberty at present
te give the name to the publie, but I shall
certainly censider it my duty to give it to
the authorities. For instance, a somewhat
prominent citizen doing business in New
Brunswick has, during the past several
months, watched the shiprnent cf war mnateriai from' the Humphrey's Mill in New
Brunswick to the Militia Departinent at
Ottawa, and I«arn told has byeen communicating the information to the head Huns
in St. John and -Halifax. That same mani
is allowed te violate provincial law and kili
garne out of seasen, te violate the Federal
law and fish eut of season, and violate the
provincial law by selling liquor illegally.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-Does the hon. gentleman know that as a matter of fact? If he
does he has a right te put the information
before the House ,and state the man's
name.

Hon. -Mr. CLORAN-I amn not an informer.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-You have a duty.
Hon. Mr. CLORAIN-I'say I shahl give
information te the proper authorities, but
I do net think in the interest cf justice
and of liberty in Canada that I should give
names now. I might frustrate investigation
and allow that man te leave the country.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-That is correct.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Do you understand
that?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-Yes.
Bon. 'Mr. CLORÂN-Well, then, be satisfled. This citizen of influence, who evidently enjoys the protection cf both Provincial and Federal Governments in his
violations of the law, has a pedlar te

te know the name cf the German Jew pedlar?
Hon. Mr. MtR-PHY-Yes.
Hon. Mr. ÇLORAN-Well, I can not give

these conflicting statements ceming from
men in high. positions in this country Uiat
1 teck Uic trouble te look inte this question. What I want te know and what the
country wants te know is which cf 'those
statements is truc. If neither is truc, la
the man stili in command cf that camp?
I have rccentiy learned that he is looking
for promotion i.n thc Militia Dcpartmcnt.
New, there is the condition cf things. What
are the people te think cf the Governmcnt
cf this country in safcguarding their rights,
;safeguarding the interests cf humaiity
and cf Uic Empire? That is the condition
cf things I want Uic Governmcnt te probe.
It makes ne difference te me pcrsonally
whether the commanding officer is in his
gravc-athougb if he were guilty cf that
act he should be in bis grave-or in a peniteritisry, but the people cf this country
are anxious te know wliat the Oovernmcnt
are doing in this matter. I have mentioned
only one instance; J1 have others which I
could state te this Parliament and put the
Goernment on their guard. Prisoere cf
war, our bitter enemies, are net only aliowcd te escape, but can pay $50 or $100
for being allowed te escape from the detentien camps in Canada. It is a national
disgrace for which the Governmeut, must
be held responsibie. I shall have some
other questions te put te the Govcrrnent
to-morrow in regard te this matter. New
dcvelopments arc arising cvery day. I am
net blaming the Government as a whoie,
but if they do net take immediate and effective measures te prctect the country
against this crying cvii, this outrage and
this scandai, they shall and must come in
for condemnation.
Jt is Up te them te protect us who arc
scnding our sens and daughters te the
front, and te proect the interests cf the

Empire. If they cannot protect our interests within our own borders what is to
become of-Canada? How many Canadians
can travel through Germany to-day free
and unmolestcd? What oipportunity wo)uli
they have, if they were so inclined, to perpetrate crimes against civilization and
humgnity, snch as Germain agents are perpctrating in this country? None. There is
the force of the Kaiser and here is the
weakness of the King. 'Germans can go
into London, Mentreal or Ottawa and fire
our public buildings and destroy our munition plants. Only last cvening two Germans with masks and a satchel passed the
guard at -a munitions plant which they
were prepared te blow up. What twe Canadians would attempt a feat of that kind
in German or Austria territoryP Not one.
We are aslccp, hon, gentlemen. we are in a
slcepy hollow, and the Germans are getting thc bcst of us, not only in the trenches
at the front, but right here in Canada. It
is up te the Govcrnment te protect us from
a recurrence cf these outrages. I ask how
many Canadians are in the employ cf the
German oGovcrnment. The Government de.
not nced te answer. I can answer fur thcm.
-Net one. 1 ask for a returu cf the number cf Germans ini thc employ cf the Canadian Govcrnment. I cannot give the answcr, because I have net the officiai record.
Parliament should be teid hew many Germans, cither by birth or extraction, are
holding positions in the public service in
Canada. The country is entitled te know
that and must have the information. The
situation is fraught with danger. We have
enough te fight against on the battie front
without having te protect ourselves inidividually against German raiders in Canada, especially in our own camps and under
the control cf our own officers of Canadian
birth, and holding Canadian positions. I
say it is time for the Government to take
action in this matter and give the people
proper protection in regard to alien enemies.
The motion was agreed to.

who may be available for that purpase. The

get them, but it only can be done by an
organization of the cauntry's resources in

understand that over 249,000 men were enlisted for averseas service. According ta

There has probably been an increase ini
these figures ai eight per cent during tihe
past five years, but estimates are flot very
reliable in sucb a case. According to, information received, unofficial, but I believe
reliable, out of the 31 battalions and other
units firat raised and chiefly in the First
Contingent totalling 42,195 officers and men
-only 12,498 were native-born Canadians.
Succeeding contingents have done ne better as the proportion has net run higher
than thirty per cent-almost the total remaining sevenly per. cent being British*
hem. There are now, in round figures,
probably 1,000,000 men of British or Canadian birth who by reason ai their age are
available for service, but some organized
steps should be taken, 1 submit, as in the
United Kingdoni, Australia and New Zealand ta find out how the country stands in
relation to, these men-who of them may be
willing, and who are not free-for sorne one
or more oi the many reasons which may
properly exist.
To raise a second 2W,000 men canna-t passibly be as easy as recruiting- the first 250,000. Moreover,- this large number, if and
when sent ta the front. must be maintained, and it bas been estimated that the
casualties will net be leas than five per
cent manthly oi the total force. This means
that we shall have ta, provide each month,
to, maintain our army's strength, at least
25,000 new mon-or 300,000 in a year. There
can be no question that the additional 250,000 ta, bring aur quota up ta, 5W0,000, and the

300,000, if roquired, annually ta keep it at
that figure, will net be obtained under the

must, therefore, introduce some ether method. (1 deubt if we could do bettor than
try as a prelim'inary what ha. been se successfully acomplished in England under the

there that the requisite total ai enlistments

inta file Houseof Giommons by the Right
Hon. Walter H. Long, cabled the "National
Registration Bill," on June 29, 1915. Mr.
Long stated that its ebject was ta obtain
.complete, general and satisfactory organizatien,- and explained:
This Bill 1. Intended to provide the machinery
which wili give the organization wlthout which
we cannot secure*what we ail want-the maximum of output with the minimum of cast. The
present systemn la of a sonieWhat haphazard
klnd. Thie proposalI n the Bill Is that there
shall le a compulsory registration of the peopie In this country, maie and female, between
the ages of 15 and 65. That registration wiil
nlot be a central onle. It is essentially a local
registration. Its results will be avaliable flot
only ta aur larger local authorities. but to our
centrai authorities. In the forms which will lie
issued to everybady particulars will lie asked
for as ta age and employmnent, and each persan
will be asked ta state whether he or she will lie
prepared to vclunteer for any fox-n of labour
with whlch lie or she la especlly acquainted
other than that in which he or she is engaged.
Each will receeve a certificate stating that lie
or she bas been registered, and I hope and lielieve that certificate will be regarded as a badge
of hanaur. This registratian will lie under the
control of the Local Gavernment Board, but It
will lie conducted by the borougli and urban
and rural autharîties thraughout the countrY

with the advice and assistance and under the
contrai of the Registrar-General, as ln the case
of the ceneus. The cast will be borne by a contribution fram the exchequer and there are
guarded penalties ln case of non-fulfilment of
obligations.

This measure became law and proved
generally acceptable. though the recuits
have not been made public. It was not
inilitary in its nature or coercive in that
connection, yet it afforded an excellent
basis for an improved recruiting systes
which brought Kitchener's army up to at
leat 2,000,000. More, however, was needed, the cali for men was insistent, the need

The Earl of Derby was appointed flirector
General of Recruiting in October 1915, and
lie appealed by letter-through the facilities
given by registration-to every man of military age in the kingdomi who had flot yet
enlisted and was not engaged in munition
or other national work, asking himi to
make the voluntary systemi successful by
doing hic IIbit "; asking him to help in
the time of his oountry's peril. With the
ald of the National Registration a tremendoue recruiting campaign ivas inaugurated,

with the following limes of action and bases
for enlistment:
Every existing recruiting body wili be made
use of ln the scheme, which will be carried
out by the aid of the national register.
Everybody who recognizes that the state haP
a right to cali on hi. services shouid enl.ist,
and those found. ta be fit wIll be attesteil

Those who wish to join the colours at once
will be aflowed to do no; the rest will go

It le hoped that It wili be many months before the older married men are called on at

Pay and allowancee at the rate of three shillings a day will be granted to men 'who are,

A subsequeiit clause provided that " for

active military service of persans ta -whorn
the foregamng provisions of this Act relate,
any such persan may be requiTed ta submit himself for inspection by a registered
medical practitioner ta be appointed for

ing false information and secrecy was provided for. The returns eventually ehowed
109,183 men af military age. It will be noted
that this Registration Act was purely military in purpase and effect. 1 might add
that in bath these Dominions and also in
South Africa a system af compulsory training exists and was just getting into preliminarY Nvorking order when the war
came.
Now I want ta say a word as ta the situation here. The total maIe population of Canada between the ages of 18 and 45, by the
census ai 1911, was 1,653,646. For the purpose of the statement I arn now making I
shall classify them according ta their places
of birth; but I can only get accurate information on this point of the ages between 20 and 44 inclusive--this makes a
difference ai a litle over 100,000 in the grand
totals, but as the proportions would not
vary much, the figures I give can be accepted. I arn putting the married and
single together, and include the widowed,
divorced and unknown, but this does not

Ust.Hon. Mr. MASON.

Single men now are under conscription there and are being steadily brought
under training.
In Britain the voluntary system has prodnced fromn five to six million men who at
least are willing to serve: in Sout.h Africa,
wlth a population of mixed races and a
inajority of one with which we were at war
ftfteen years ago, over 100,000 men have
been obtained: in New Zealand, with 1,000,000 population, 40,000 men are in arms and
over 100,000 have offered: in Australia,
aocording to the recent statement here in
Ottawa of the Prime Minister, the Hon.
hir. Hughes, Australià had by February lst,
1916. sent 145,000 men to the front and
enlisted 240,000, out of a population of at
least 2,000,000 less than ours. Surely we
cau do at least as well proportionatiely, and
do sô in an orgauized, effective way.
Ail the more is registration necessary in
view of*the fact that large numbers of our
young men are said bo be leaving the country to evade military duty. Australie now
has the following regulation:
. No male British uubJect whoee age exceeds
seventeen y sars and dose flot exceed forty-five
years ghall leive, or attempt to leave. the Comnmonwealth imlesa a pessport han been issued to
hlm by the Department of External Âftairs.
Any persan authorlzed for the purpose by the
competent naval or milltary authority, or any
police constable or officer of Customs, may arrest wlthout -warrant any persop who attempts
to ieave, the CommonweaithL in contravention of
this regulat4on.

This would have a double effect here-it
would keep in the country thosie required
for military service, and also those needed
for industrial work.
Surely our young men must soon begin
to sec that if Great Brîtain goes under in
this vast war, we go too: that Britain's
navy is the only safeguard of our commerce
and our shores and has been so for a hundred years: that British money and financial interests are at the base',of ail our progress sud thsit if they go our prosperity goes,
with a rush: that common gratitude, aside
altogether from ties of union and allegiance
to a common throne, bind us to do our
uttermost in this struggle for and with a
nation which has nursed our infancy,
guardied our childhood and protected our
manhood; that if those long, thîn lines in
France were once smiashed, the German
guns on the coast could soon command the
coast of Eugland, and that one of the first
demands o! a victorious ènemy would be

family, by the obligations of a Christian
cxvilization-yes, even by the self-interest

and by every sense cf manliness and duty.
Let us have a register which *will show
where hie stands and why.
Should the exigencies of the war make
the depletion of men in the more important
industries-and
in
transportation and
financial institutions, eto.-more distinct,
and render aid trom the women cf our country necessary, I an' convinced that they
would rise te 'the occasion. In Great Britain
500,000 women are engaged in the making
of munitions and in other work involving
drudgery and dîscomfort, in order te release
the men for service and many of these
women have hitherto hardly known what
work meant. It would be in Canada as it
is in England, only one more illustration
of the self-sacriflcing spirit for which women
are noted when necessity calls.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-I do flot know
whether this matter could be brought before the House as a question of privilege,
but I am quite willing, as I am sure every

He addressed the executive committee declaring
that the Government was not committed to adhering to the old economic policiez, which the
experience of the war had shown must be readJusted to the new conditions.
Representatives of Canada, Australla and

Several Important resolutions were adopted

adopted, declares:
«The experience of the war has sbown that

time of national perti lie In the possession by
this nation of the power to produce Its requirements from Its own soil and its own factories,
rather than In the possession of values which
xnay be exported and exchanged for producta
and manufactures of foreign countriee."
Another resoluUIon, for reciprocal trading relations and tarifts. developed some opposition
from the adherents of the traditional, fres-trade
policy, but finally prevailed wlth practical unanimity. It provides, Ilfirst. for preferential tradIng relation between ail British countries; second, for reciprocal trading relations between the
British Empire and allied countries; third, for
favourable treatment of neutral countries:
fourth, for restriction by tariffs and o'.herwi»
on ail trade relations with enemy countries, so
as te mak-ý It Impossible to return to pre-war
conditions."
Other resolutions adopted provided for the
Government's Immediately consulting with Canada. Australia and other colonies on the problems arising as the result of the war, particularly with reference te a reciprocity agreement
and the regulation of future trade relations with
Germany and Austria.
Every one of us can remember the opening up cf the western provinces. It is but
a few years since those provinces vere
opened up, and it is wonderful to see wbat
has been accomplished in that short period.

That in connection with opportunities for Increaeed agricultural production it is necessary
to bear in mind the Importance of:
<a) Improved methods of production with a
view to a better return to, the producer;
(b) Assisting tils purpose by proper instruction and demonstration;
(c) Increasing the acreage under production;
(d) AttractIng immigration of a type whlcil
would aid In ensuring a large and permanient agricultural population;
(e) Stiinulating and encouraging co-operation among the producers; and.
(f) Providing cold storage and abattoir facilities.
The Prime Minister further observes that the
agricultural production of Canada le of a bigilly diversified character and la spread over a
great territory comprising an enormous area,
of fertile land of which only a emall percentage
it at present tîlled.
The conditions of soll climate and situation
are so varied as to emphazize trhe necessity of
pursuing methods of cultivation and purpeses
of production which are especially suited te
any particular locality under consideration.
The great area. of territory embraced within
the Dominion createls unusual problems which
affect:
(a) Distri.butign of preducts In our home
markets and the trade thus created between the several. provinces and their
various communities.
(d) The transport of products to our national ports from which they shall eventually reach their destination abroad;
and,
(c) Their transport te the market of destination abroad.
The Prime Minister states that so far as ls
compatible with conditions herein *entioned
it ia manifestly In the public Interest that before export the preduct should 'be converted
through manufacture In Canada into the form
in wbich it is proposed te be consumed or used;
thus encouraging and stimuiating those Industries subsidiary te agriculture which. can be
cari ied on successfully in the Dominion.
Important questions as te the marketing of
our food preducts, Including consideration ot
the time at which and the methods by which
tis is accemplished. should receive careful atThe value of co-operative efforts
tention.
ameng the producers, and the Importance of reducing the present great discrepancy between
the price received by the preducer and that
paid by the consumer, should net bie overloeked.
It has been represented te the Governnient
that large numbers of persons whe before emigrating te Canada had been engaged in agricultural pursuits, have net settled upen the
land in Canada, but have -been attracted by

tunities for a vigorous and effective policy of

immigration which should have as Utn object
the purpose of attraoting te our shores immigration of a suitable type, and of inducing the
settiement of an agricultural population upon
the fertile uncultivated lande which are ahunidant both In Western and In Eastern Canada.
In tie connection Inquiry ahould be made as
to the means by which and the Unes upon which
the Pederal Government, whether upon its own
sole. initiative or in co-operation with Provincial Governmnents can best carry out an effective scileme ef colonisation.

Governments may be afforded te those who
may see empleymcnt.
The Prime Minister furtiler observes that the
question of trlinsportation, whether by land or
water carniage, la for reasons above indicated
closely connccted with the preblemis under consideration. With tis should be censidcred the
advantages which would undeubtedly be derived from permanent Improvement of highways
which are In truth an important part of our
transportation aystem.
The approachlng completion of twe additional

As Canada has been and will be for many

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIFN.

Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-I must confess at
once that while I think what je suggested
je highly desirable, 1 arn unable to agree
with the bon, gentleman as to air the possibilities that have been euggested. 1 think
it is true that the most crucial tirne in the
histôry cf Canada has arrived, or soon
will arrive, and At behooves Canadians in
every walk of life ta study the future and
see how we are ta emerge frorn the difficulties which in my humble opinion are
likely ta overtake us. ~I arn not one of
those who entertain the opinion thet many
of thé manufactures which are dormant taday are dormant because of. the war. Canada is at the moment going thraugh a period of artificiel developrnent just as it wvas
for many yeare prior ta the war. For perhaps fiteen or twenty years prior ta 1914
Canada lived under e.bsalutely artificial
conditions. Enormous arnaunts of capital
had been expended for the construction af
railways and for developrnent, whieh gave
an impetus ta this country and which gave
meny Cenadians, in my humble opinion, a
wrong impression of Canada and its possibilities. But for the war -I coneider thait taday ve would be snflering from a moet terrible depressian consequent -on the abnormal development which. LI have elready
described. Now, we are ternporarily saved
from that depression by the immense crop
ai lest year and the higli prices charged
the year before and the very fair prices
obtained this year, and the eirrnous manufacture af munitions of war. Just so long
as the war laste, and, juet so long as Canada bas fair crops, J think this condition
overwill continue, but -alter the war is J
not irnmediately perhaps, but within a reasonable period efterwards-will corne a
tirne when a great rnany Canadiens who
are not thinking to-day will begin to think.
Many of our people imagine thet we are
existing- under natural conditions, wheréas,
as I have seid, we are living entirely under
artificiel conditions. The tirne will arrive
in the history of Canada when aur strongest and rnast capable business men should
lead in the administration of the afiairs of
our country, simply because I believe we
are approeching a period ai stress such as
this country bas neyer known. I *arn told
by corne that I arn a pessimist. Well,. my
lufe has nat dernonstrated 'that I arn e p essimist, but I1 belleve in looking et conditions as they are; I do not believe in

times, and live upon the natural and the
producing resources of Canada, which. are
prirnarily agriculture, lumber, rnining., and
fishing. We will enjoy, of course, a certain
measure of industrial expansion, but il cannot believe it possible that we can expect
any great industrial developrnent aftei the
war. -I will tell you why. A great rnany
do net realize how the world is going to
be inrpoverished in consequence of this war.
The purchasing power of the world will be
enorrnously rednced. It is true that the
ptirhasing power cf the United States
will not be reduced, because they are temporarily enjoyig prosperity unparalleled
perbaps in the history cf the world; but
if they expect that after the war they are
going to seli largely abroad q think they
will flnd theniselves greatly rnistaken.
You cannot reduce the wealth of the world
te the extent of perhaps two or three hundreds cf billions cf dollars, as it will be
reduced by this war, and do the sarne business afterwards; that is perfectly inpossible. I will admit that immediately after
the war there will be a period cf reconstruction 'in Europe, during which there
will be a further extension of credit, just
as there has been an extension of credit
for carrying on this war-which simply
meane that though not parallel with the expendiiture for the war, will be an expenditure which. does net imrnediately bring
about returns--siimply a further extension
cf credit,.and rnaking the debts cf the various countries involved greater than they
were before. Now, under*tliese conditions,
the question for us is what is 'Canada going
to do? As has been suggested by rny hon.
friend who rnoved this resolution, every
ieans -possible should 'b. taken to attract
the best kind cf immigration to thîs country that we can get; every means should
be taken for the developrnent cf our agricultural resources and cf everything which

the period which I have described a great
deal of the borrowed rncney in Canada was
net expended in thse best interests cf the
Dominion. It has been expended upon
railway construction which Canada dees
net require now, and is net likely'te require in the future. One' cf the strongest
things we could do in this country is te
appoint -a commission te determine how
many thousand miles cf existing railway
can be dispensed with in tihe best interests
of Canada. Our condition was this: before
the war we owed abrcad $ 150,000,000 in

That was our liabîlity. Our lîability bas
enorrnously increased consequent on the
war. We will have a large pension fund
to pay. One cure would be a large influx
of population; in niy opinion thait is the
only thing which would assist Canada out
of the. extreme difficulty which 1 thinis is
going te overcome it. The queotion iB, are
we te have that immigration? A great many
believe that we are. Personally, I should
like te see it, but II de net know where it is

Han. Mr. LOUGHEED-Tiis is ratiet
an extraordinary Bihl wiici has been

the firet place, I might say to hon. gentlemen that it is very undesirable that a Bill
embodying a policy so unique and important. and particularly dealing with
money, should originate. with a private
memberHon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Why not?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-And more so that
it should be introduced in this branch of
the legisiature, in which a money Bill cannot originate. In the fiast place the messure is confiscatoxy. That is a subject
which should alone be deait with by the
Goverament of the day. It involves a ruost
important policy, and defeats a well-recognized principle of parliamentary practice
and procedure, namely, that a money Bill
cannot be introduoed or originated ini this
(Jhamnber. It ia not necessary for me ta
dwell upon that feature of the Bill. Hon.
gentlemen will perceive the anornaly atoneS,
and the evasion which it would be of a wellestablished. principle of parliamentary practice, not only a principle of practice, but
a rule of Parliarnent. A money Bill can
only originate in the House of Commons,
and then must be deaiit with by reconimnendation of -the Crown. Thse hion. gentiemans Bull proposes that ail unpaid balances

quite clear, and it must be manifest ta every
lion. gentleman, that if legislation of this
character can be introduced or can orig-inate
in this House and that a private member
by legisiation can say how public moneys
shahl be expended, we are absolutely ig-noring one of the best estahhished principles
and rules of Parliament. I think I should
not enlaige ta any greater extent upon this
Bihl than I have already done, except ta
say that we appreciate the generoaity of the
lion. gentleman from Grandville in appr.opriating the moneys of others, and we appreciate his patriotism and loyalty in appropriating this money on behaîf of thé

The SPEAKER-I arn ready-tW hear the

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Drop

Ifon. Mr. DANDURAND-With reference
to this point of order, I would draw
attention to perhaps an unconstitution2i
eature of my hon. friend's Bill which bas
ot been touched upon by t~he hon. leader
f the Government. - It je the att.empt by
his Parliament to appropriate to the
)ominion Excheque-r sums of money which
hould be escheated to, the Provincial
Govern.ment. In these deposits, there are
undou.btedly nuimerous sums which are
unclairned. because of th-e death of the deposi4tor, and bcause of the absence of heirs.
These sums undoubtedly go to and are the
property of the Provincial Government.
8o that this is one f urther reason why ithis
point of order ehould be maintained.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-With refeenoe to
he question raised by the hon. leader of

rinciple appears to be so plain, as laid

MARCH 15, 1916
my hon. friend bas in his mind. It la no
more a money Bill to amend the Bank Act
than to amend the ïMilitia, or Post Office
Act.
I quite agree that 1 would be out
of order if I were to in-troduce a Bill to
spend public rnoney, or to ask the ýGovern*ment to put some amount i the Estimates
to spend. I would have no right to do
that; but 1 take the Bank Act and say that
sucb balances as are shown ini the reports
of the banks might be disposed of in ithe
way the Government think *best. I arn
surprised that a lawyer of the ability of
the hon. leader of the Government in this
House, and a gentleman of the experience
of the ex-Speaker of the House of C'omnîons
shou]d say that this is a money Bill.
hon. friend froni Delorimier bas raised a
constitutional question dealing with irnniovable properties andi rights in the province of Quebec. but I do flot think he can
seriously say that the moneys of bainks
which are under the control of the Federal Government belong to the province.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-AII our revenues
are under the control of the Dominion rjovernment.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETrE-The hon, gentleman is speaking as the president of a
bank which holds some of this money.
Hon. Mr. DÂNDUBAND-No, I was flot
speaking as such.

Hon. Mr. Choquette-That la what I amn suggesting.
Hon. Mr. Lougheed-My hon. friend ls aware
that atter a certain period goes by these funds
become the property of thue Crown.
That is what I arn suggesting. At the
Lime we thought that there was alzeady a
law to that effect, anmd it disposes of!the constitutional point raised by the hon. gentleman from Delorimier, ince the money already belonged to the Government. The
hon. gentleman .cited section '114 of the
-Bank Act, to show ithat alter a certain tirne
the mnoney belonged to them s long asé
it was not claimed. I will cite cases later
on. 1 think 1 had botter ask foi an adjourniment of the debate now%,as :I rhould
like to consult -the authorities.
Of
course I have great Sespect for the opinion
of the hon, leader but it is only the opinion of one lawyer. His opinion may be good
if lie supports it by some authority. I say
that this is flot a nioney Bill. I have some
doubts about the matter, and 1 shail just
leave it i the hsnds of the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-There ia no question
that the point is well taken as far as the
second clause of the Bill is eoncerned. The
first portion of the Bill does not atternpt
to dispose of these unclaimed balances
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-There mîght,
perhaps, be some doubt about that, though
I arn not asking the Government to spend
the inoney. I was just suggesting that
the moneys shah 'be used for such a pur-.
pose. If I1were asking the Governnient te
dispose of the money fto pay somethingfor instance, if I were te say the rooney
would be used te pay the widows or descendants o! these people-that would be
a different proposition, but when I say
that the Governrnent rnay taike it for
the patriotic fund or some other purpose. I do flot dispose o! it at ail. They
apply it for the public good If the money
were to be taken to build a coîhege or hospital. or some institution the point wou]d
be well taken, but when we do not dispose
o! it that is a different proposition, and 1
think clause 2 is still in order.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUE7I!rE-d ar n ot
surpriped at bank directoré holding. the
view that they shduld not give the rnoney
to the Government, but as the Bill is
framed, it cannot be said to be a rooney
Bill or that it should not originate i this
House. I have not the authorities under
my hand just now, but I would be very
rnueh surprised if the Speaker should declare the point of order well taken. I was
about to cite what had been stated in the
public press and newspapers supporting
the Governinent advocating the principle
of the Bill and saying it was a good thing
and ought to be done. I amn surprised that
the leader of the Government is now raising this question, because when I first

the other. This Bill proposes to declare
what shahl become of a certain amount of
money that is left on deposit iu the bank.
Is that not an indirect mode of coilecting
money for the country? You might just as
well say, "«We wili tax you for holding
that." ît is an indirect mode of disposing
of the money, and it would be equally out

heirs to dlaim this mouey it belongs to the
Provincial Government. Apart from that, let
me say 'that since the hon. gentleman introduce4 this question a few days ago, 1
took some littie trouble to ask bankers
what course they adopt in order to »scertain,
if poslsible, the ownera or -heirs who would

information received frorn the -bankers in

where they lived. In fact, 'the manager of
the Bauk o! Commerce informed me he had
travelled miles and miles te induce sme
of the bheirs to corne in and take the money
that had been lying there for twelve years.
Thse chargea againat the banks ini that

in reducing- the royalty on coal in the firet

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That je Order in
Council -No. 103: the explanation je as follows: Under the late Coal Mining Regulations lande were acquired by purchase, at
the rate of $10 an acre, and the -royalty an
the coal was fixed a%10 cents per tan.
Under the new regulations. coal mining
righte are acquired under lease, at the Tate
of $1 an acre per annum, and the royalty
je fixed at 5 cents per tan.
Owners of coal mining rights acquired
by purchase, who were large producers,
deinonstrated. ta the depa.rtment by a comparison that they were paying a higher rate
for their rights than those who acquired
by lease.
As this -appeared te be clearly the case,
the royalty on coal mined from lands acquired by purchase was reduced from the
10 cents ta 7 cents per ton, such reduction
to take effect from the firat day af Jainuary,
1915.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (Acting Speaker)
-The lion, gentleman has just cited a paragraph from Bourinot at page 427, but I do
not believe that it applies to the present
case, because from the statement made by
the hion. gentleman from *Compton, he
simply desires to read what purports ta be
a speech made by an hion. member of this
House, and to ask if that is a correct report
of his speech. He has not stated that hie
intends to make a motion or to act subsequently. Some action may be in bis mind,
according to what will appear to him to be
necessary. It will be then time to see what
is the value of the action he takes, as to the
regularity of the procedure. So far I decide
that the hon. gentleman is in order in
reading-the article and putting the question.
Hon. Mr. POPE-mn raising the question
of privilege in reference to the remarks
made by the Speaker of this House on the
27th June, as reported in Le Droit newspaper and other newspapers in Canada, 1
desire to say that 1 have had a translation
into Eng-lish of the article, which appears
in the paper in French.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (Acting Speaker)
-The hion. gentleman bas the original text

Hon. Mr. POPE-Yes.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Wîll the lion, gentleman be kind enough to let me have the copy
of Le Droit while hie is reading the translation?
Hon. Mr. POPE-Certainly. The translation reads as follows:
The Hon. Senator Landry.
This morning, says Hon. Senator Landry, I
was following the beautifui procession of the
St. John Baptist Society and although far from
mY home cltY, I stili could believe myself in
the midst of my own people. I went in to the
church and there saw faces which were not unknown ta me. At the foot of the Altar, I saw
Zouaves lined up for a guard of honour; in
Quebec we also have Zouaves. 1 ss.w the Garde
Champlain ln the chancel; in Quebec we have
a Garde Champlain. I saw volunteer soldiers of
His Majesty.
I heard names familiar to me;
no need to speak of the Recoliets, we have them
in Quebec.
The speaker in the pulpit once
iived in Llmailau. I beiieved myseif at home
and I remembered that this suburb already
formed a separate municipality. I have been
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Mayor of Limoilou and 1 must tell you that I
ceased being mayor of that place to become the
father of the little Ontario chlldren. 1 am not
one of the position-seekers spoken of by Mgr.
Latulippe.
The Presldency. 0f the Association.
I was cailed ta the presldency of the Association CýLnadIenne-Française d'Education d'Ontario and I shall devote myself to the revindication of our rights In this province. 1 want
to crawn my career. I want to crown my poiltical life by obtaining wlth your help the revindication of our rlghts and the triumph of the
cause we are ail fightlng for. The stand I assumned In the Manitoba, Alberta and KCeewatin
questions snay have designated me for this hrgh
position. The stand I assumed In ail those circumstances praved that I could lay aside ail
party affiliations
where the rights, of the
minority were cancerned. We have waged an
arduous fight In the House and through the
newspapers, and I dlaimn a large share of the
work undertaken for the Cathoica In Manitoba.
The trip to Rome.
I went ta Rame, continues the Speaker in
the interests of the minority, for the arrivai of
an Apostollc Delegate was destlned ta muzzie
the French Canadian ciergy and thase fighting
at hi. aide for the triumph of our Interesta. 1
went ta Rome to prevent the nomination of a
delegate, because we feared he might fail ln
the clutches of the chiefs of that day. Rampoila, Cardinal Secretary of State, answered
that my efforts were late; the delegate had been
appolnted the very day an whlch I salled.
The Canadian Government had asked for a
delegate ta settie the Western schoal question,
but on that same day the second reading of the
Bill was adopted by the Engiish niajority of the
local Hanse. The question was not ssttled, and
those who have read the documents now part
of history understand that I continued my fight
agalnst the delegate as weii as agalnst the
Government
Laurler's Poiicy.
That question was settied by a compromise
between7 the judges and Mr. Greenway's party,
thait la ta say between the oppressors and the
jut.ges. But the Manitc>aa school question was
neyer settled. We obtained a Privy Council
order to the Manitoba legisiature demanding
that the Cathoics' situation be remedied, and,
in defauit of this, ordering the Federai Government to pass a remedying law.
The Order was passed, and was followed by a
iengthy. useless discussion which lasted until
prorogation. When the time camne for the matter to go into comxnlttee, the discussion hung fire
until second reading and noth.ing was settled.
Later came the establishment of the Alberta

isted in the WVest stipuiating that majorities
might have whatever schools they like, and
minorities should have separate schoois.
Honourable Fitzpatrick was then Ministerof
Justice. Laurier presented a Bill favouring new
schools. Sifton ma.de hi. noisy exit from the
Cabinet, and Fielding threatened ta leave also.
Laurier withdrew his Bill; the rights of the
minority were thus sacrificed. To-day. the Catholic mlnorlty in the West are on suffrance
and their rights are ephemerai.
The Keewatin affair.
Later, when Keewatin was annexed, adds Mr.
Landry, I became absolutely separated from my

MARCH M6 1916

friands, although I was then presîdent of the

Senate, a position condemning me to silence. A
speaker has no rîght to speak. 1 abandoned mny
own friends to fly to the remecue of Keewatin.
Titres Buis were then on the Table. The firet

The underworld of Eistory.

express the wish that questions like those of
the Dli-lingual achools shbuld, bc settled accordIng te the spirit of the constitution. Nothing
dangerous In that. But our enemies eyes were
open; they protestedt strongly. To cain these

Senator Edwards submitted a sub-amnendment
with a long preamble. forbidden Dy the Rules
saying i was Inopportune to decide on the question. I deciared the motion out of order. and 1
ws right.

Strike in the Sonate.
My decision, saya the Speaker, was reverued
by aIl the Conservatives and aJ. the Liberals
flot Frenchi Canadians.

It was a fight between

parties. I did flot wish te fan the diames, but
a few days later, the fanatic majority rose up
anew against me on a question of patronage. I
saw the Premier, and told hini the only thlng
I could do was leave tae Chair. The Premier
advised me te resume the Chair. 1 refused
emphatically. On the day of Prorogation, I resumed. the Chair deciaring that the Premier, In
a letter te me, thoreughly approved of my attitude. That lçtter. If read, wouid have ferced
a Minister of the Crown te resign.
No Politics.
No. the question ls flot dead. adds the speaker.
When I acceptcd the presidency ef the Association, 1 placcd the condition that tais question
shou'id be lifted from aIl party strife and edectioneering manoeuvres. It is net just te blame
the Government for an act they did not commit or for an omission for which they are not
respensible.
I published a manifeste. I made a tour of
the Ontario centres; I wished te come Inte contact with the French Canadian clement of the
province.
Stili wc have two elements fighting against
us. First the Orangemen who are waging war
te the death on French in Ontario. What right
has orangeism In this country? 1 understand Its
existence in Ireland at a certain time, but should
the orangemen bring their quarrels and diwaeneiens into this country? It may be remembered
that at Belleville, King Edward VII then Prince
of Wales, refused te pass Deneata the arches
He had undererected b>' the Orangemen.
steod that, far frem Ireland, It has ne reason ef existence In the land.
The Rous of Commons and the Senate both
repeatedly refused them Incorporation, finaîlly
they reeived a Charter as s mutual protection
society.

Second Enemny.
Our second enemny la found in the population
which, refuses to be French and established In
this country. I shall flot place on the same level
ail English speaking mnen, for we have on this
platfea'm a man who consecrated hîs life to a
fight for our rlghts. The cause of ibis unnatural
league between the two elements we do not
lcnow.
I amn actually In correspondence with the
Âpostolic Delegate te, try and arrive at a compromise honourable to all. There la talk of
an appeal to the Privy Ceuncil, but Defore the
decision of the Ontario Courts ls known we
may have another appeal, and this time to the
Eternal city. We are ready te receive her decision, and we await i with confidence.
Injustice of Clause 17.
We are trying to, make the Ontario Government understand the Injustice of Clause 17. 1
wrote the Prime Minister asking for an Interview, but Ilîness chaîns hlm to lits bcd, and hie
tells me lie shall hear me when hie is better.
and I hope we shaîl reach an understanding. If
notwlthstanding our efforts and persuasions, we
cannot obtain an honourabie compromise, I can't
say what we shail do. but I shaîl answer like
KCitchener when he was asked when the war
wouid end; IlI cannot say 'when the war will
end. but i will begin towards May.
We are only beginning our fights. Promn the
province of QuebecI ve are receiving ammunition and encouragement; It ie good to know that
a whole province ls with us and that we have
brothers who wll heip us.
Tlhe, students In seyerai achools gave up their
achool prises to give the money to the Canadian
fighting men In our province for the revindication of their rights.
Denominational fichools.
Ail amendments to our constitution muet corne
from the British Governiment. One clause says
the provinces have exclusive jurlediction, but
in this senne that the rights enjoyed by a certain class In 1867 must De maintained after
Confederation. And In 1867 the separate echools
already exiuted; the Act reads:
IDenominational fichools Il. They are schoels
where the precepts of religion are taught.
Do you understand that In a Catholic school
it le possible to confide Your children te
Protestant teachers and Protestant inspeotors?
It ts an anomaly. Such an anemaly exists however, and I contsnd we have flot the Denominational schools granted us by Cenfederation.
Clause 17 constitutes an Intervention In the
Catholic scheols because It orders double Inspection.
Privy Counicil.
If the Ontario Courts concludes the speaker.
are flot favourable to us, we shaîl carry our
claimis to tac Privy Council, and we will ask
the Mother Country If our children from Ontarie and Quebec have no ether right than that
ef giving up their Ilves in the service ef the
Empire. We shall call for Justice, and shall
obtain It, because it la Engiand's policy to render Justice te ail.
I finally hope. that with your hetp. ladies and
gentlemen. and with the help of ail those Who
occupy high position in the country, we shahl
work to repulse the common enemny and obtain
victery; it may be that after years we shall
obtain what we wlsh for and Ottawa shall be

lion. Mr. POPE-I rise to a point o! order.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I arn speakîr.g to
the point o! order.
Honi. Mr. POPE-The Speake&r decided
that it was a question of privilege and I hiad
a îîgyht to proceed. The Speaker is entitledI
in the sarne respect from the hon. gentleman
as froni me.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-The Speaker could
not decide the other day that it was a question of privilege, because he had not in his
hands the proper documents. He said if it
was a question of privilege lie could proceed
without notice, but that was only conditional. He neyer deciÙed it was a question
o! privilege and could not decide that before
lie knew the subject that was to be brought
up. It is not a question o! privilege.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I arn not sure that
1 understand exactly what is the question
before the Chair, whether it is the right to
immediately follow the reading of this
article by a motion, or whether this is a
question of privilege or not. His Honour was
correct in saymng that the gentleman who
occupied the chair the other day did not
decide that this matter was a question o!
privilege because it was unknown to him
what the matter was, but lie decided that
any member had a right to rise to a question o! privilege at any tume. If the question is as to whether this is a question of
privilege or not, having heard it, I would
like to draw attention to the authority that
1 read already referred to, Bourinot, at page
4124, as follows:
It mnay be stated In general terme that they
refer to ail matters affecting the rights and
immunities of the Bouse, collectiveiy. or the
position and conduct of members in their refrresentative character.

It affects theni.
ceeds:

Then the quotation pro-

Prima facie any question affecting a memnber
Is considered a case of priviiege.

I have no concern with the large bulk of
the article that was read. Of course the
reference to the Irishrnen does not affect us
in

any way.

Hon. Mr. LAND1tY-I know we always
went hand ini hand.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE--I wish to refer to
what, in rny judgment, is the essence of
the article: that is, spéaking of the maj ority of the Genate as fanatics. Nuttaîl, in
his English dictionary, says that a fanatie
is «'a person filled with religious frenzy;
Hon. Mr. LANDRY.

fanatical; enthusiastic; wild; mad; vfsionary; and therefore by analogy presurnably
incapable of acting impartially or giving a
fair judgment on any question." Now, 1
ask whether that is not a question of privilege when applied to, hon. members of the
Senate? Webster defines a fanatic as -"one
who is wildly extravagant, especially or(
religious subjects;- and ianaticismn as
frenzy; violent agitation; temporary rnadness; fury; delirium. 1 enerely ask if that
is the condition of the rnajority of the S;enate. 6urely there is a question of privilege
for the Senate to deal with-and I arn only
dealing with the question whether it is or
is not a question o! privilege. That is al
1 have to say on it. In my judgment it isz
erninently a question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (Acting Speaker)
-I have before me Bourinot, who states at
page 427:
Precedents go to show thst the Canadian
House of Commons. In Its deuire to deal
promptly with ail questions affecting its mremnbers. han generally waived the strict rules that
govern matters of privilege properiy speaking
and given every poible faciUity for inquiry
thereon. but when a memnber proposes to make
a motion touching another memnber, lt i. irequently found conventent that he uhould 'atate
hie intentions In bis place. and then give notice
that he will mnove It when motions are called ia
due order on a subsequent day.
Now, as the matter is flot one th-at has
arisen yesterday, as I understand, because
I was personally at preceding, discussions
on the matter,- I would suggest that the
hon. member from Compton should pro-~
ceed by notice of motion, which will» very
likely comprise the substance of the charge,
or of the malignant part, -as he believes
that to be malignant, in his motion, so
that the niembers will -have the advantage
of seeing that part of the article which isz
impugned.
Ho n. Mr. POPE-lt is always my pleasure to abide by the decision of the Chair;
and as it is very important that the Senate
s hould have sorne work before it, I therefore, froni the economic and every point of
view, quite agree with the decision that
you have given, lSir, and shaîl take the
first opportunity to bring the matter up
aaiîn according to, the rules of this House.
Hon. Mtr. SPROULE-I do not wish to
dissent from the decision or to take any
part in this matter, but it seenis to me that

addition to that it was found, on some few
occasions, that children, who will bite
every thing they get hold of, have poisoned
themselves by biting these matches. I
believe there was a case in Prince Edward
-Island where a w<jman dissolved the phosphorus part of these matches in water in
order ta poison some people or children,
and she succeeded in doing- so. But this

already taken by the Government in the
appointment of a commission. What will
be the situation ai Canada after the war,
and the effect of the cessation ai hastilities
on aur economic hife, is a quesition that
hardly any one can enswer. We are in an
abnormal condition, employing thousands
ai people in trades that will stop when the

thousands ai men returning ai ter having

But 1 do not rely as much as do a number
of Canadians who have -expressed themselves on this problem, upon European
immigration after the wvar to find the increased number cf banda that will do the

1 fear that when this war is over, and seven

for farm hands throughout Europe that people will net think of ceming over to North

towards our shores. My conviction is that
w-e will have to rely upon the tens of
thousands cf young Canadians who will remmr and w-ho should be encouragsd to setdle on the land. WVe will also have, to
wvhat extent I do not know, but I hope te
a large extent, the ex-service men of England, Scotland and 'lreland, who having, uprooted themselves from their own country
for a couple of years may make up their
minds to seek larger opportunities in Canada. 'It seemis te me this will,bs a someuhat limitsd source from which we will
draw, and I fear w-e shaîl be some years
without sseing a stream of immigrants corning as heretofore from northern Europe to
settie in our northw-sst. Thers is another
source *frou w-hidi w-S can increase our
wvealth, naniel-. the development of our industries.
I -beiiev-e Canadian
industries will have to rely more on the foreign
than on the domestic markets, because I
ftar that wes will flot have the M00,000 or
300,000 immigrants that we got yearly during the last filtesn years, to increase the
consumption of Canadiani .manufactured
zoods. But il the home market does not give
our industries those advantages which thsy
fouud during the last 15 or 20 years, it
sesms te me that Europe, devastatsd
Europe, bled white, will be unable to find
within its ow-n borders aîl that it will re-

quire to rebuild those immense areas cf
country which will have been devastated.
My hon. friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Edwards) stated yesterday that Europe
would be so mweakened financially that it
would have to continue 'borrowing in order
to bring about its proper restoration. That
may be, and ' hat will probably ibe, but it
is not our preblem; it will be theirs. There
is one sure question-that the devastated
parts of France, of Belgium, of Russia and
many other parts will have to be restored, aud that those countries will, by
borrowing or otherwise, at once undertake
the task cf rebuil-diug.
The French Government has already appointed an important commission of engineers, architeets,
and other mnen o~f knowledge, to study the
ineans of restoring the devastated northern
part of France.
That, commission has
invited the world to send representatives to
an exhibition which will take place in
May next in Paris, in order to have them
exhibit the plans and the goods that they
could furuîsh towards the restoration of
that dlevastated country.
I may say that
already some Canadians have been moving,
and the lumber snerchants, manufacturers
and woodworkers have already met and put
up portable houss which -will be needed
by the thousanda in northern France, and
have sent soms over to Paris. In this work
they have had. the closest co-operation of
the Minister of Trade and Commerce and
some of the Provincial
Goveruments.
±Now, I. do not know if this. effort which
France is making to 'draw the attention of
its allies, and possibly of the neutrals, to
the opportunities which will await them
in that country, will be taken advantage
of by the divers trades aud industries of
Canada.
The
Dominion
Governmnent«
should lose no time in sending first class
business men as representatives cf the
Dominion iu those lands to survey the
ground and ses what should be done to
direct the attention of Canada to the opportunities which are already offeringthemnselves and which will ail the more increaae as we near the hour when peace will
be declared.
It is true that we have commercial representatives in most of those
countries, but I wculd impress upon my
hon. irieud w-ho represents the Government
in this .House the necessity at this timie of
enlarging our representation by sending
keen business men who could examine into
the conditions there snd into the opeuings
which offer. My hon. friend I rom de Sala-

the appointment of such a joint committe

gratuitously to the country.
Buch a committee could sub-divide itself
so as to have one committee per province,

varjous aspects of the question so as te
make suggestions to the Government. My
hon. friand is chairman of a commission
which will have to tackle quite a large
problam. 1 wondar if hae could not avail
himself of the suggestion I make to appoint sub committees o! members of both
Houses living in the same community and
who could be easily assembled. because it
is'out of the question to ask members of
this House and of the Commons, after recess, if selected from every province, to
meet et a given place, at Ottawa, for instance. When the session is over we al
know that members of -Parliament and
senetors are desirous o! returning to their

appointed and provincially organized, perhaps they could help in the work which is
confided to the care o! my hon. friand. 1

towards placing men on the land, by a

Resuming the postponed debate on the motion

of the Hon. Mr. Mason:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for a

up to the first day of March, 1916.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-I did not intend to move the adjournment of the
debate last night in order to make a
speech, or to answer the remarks made
by the hon. gentleman from Toronto, but
simply to read his remarks and see what
was in them, because I did not catch them
as ha spoke. In looking over these ramarks I find thay are just a racapitulation irom statistics, collected fromn papars,
not only in this country but from other
countrias beyond the seas, rafarring
specially to Lord Darby's scheme of racruiting. I do not intand to go ovar his
ramarks, but I juat desire to put a ques-

that comrnittee, can this Bouse take action
on a Bill without the evidence relating to
it being brought before the Bouse? In one
case the committee report that the Bill has
been rejected.
The SPEAKER-If I understand the hon.
gentleman wants to raise a question of

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-No, I want a ruling.
The SPEAKER-That will come Up on
the eonsideration of the report which is on

to raise and. discues the question when il
is reached.
ESCAPE 0F PRISONERS. FROM D'ÊTENTION CAMPS.
A QUESTION 0F PRP.TLEGE.
Hon. Mr. G¶RROIR-Before the Orders
cf the Day are called, I wish, on behaîf of
Col. Morris, who had charge of the camp
at Amherst -when the escape of prîsoners
took place, to make a statement. I do not
wish to refer to the recent debate on the
subject in this Bouse, as under our rules
When

the' papere are
on, it may be desirable to go into the matter very fully. I need only say that inost
serious charges haee been publicly made
and her.alded throughout Ibis country in the
press againet'an officer in charge cf a very
important office. . If they are ailowed
to go unanewered they will do a great iiijury to the repulation o! a man whom I
believe to be an honourable and competent
officer. The hon. member for Victoria Division (Hon. Mr. -Cloran) in the debate
which tdok place a few days ago upon bis
motion for papers in connection with this
matter, -stated thal Germans had escaped
frorn the detention camp at Amhberst and
that they were allowed and encouraged to
escape by the cornmanding officer in charge
of that camp. As lie says, that is a grave
and serious charge. Col. 'Morris is a British officer who bas had considerable experienceHon. (Mr. POWER-I rise to a question
of order. I hold that Col. Morri~.. who.
as f ar as we are concerned, is a privale
person, and not connected with either
Bouse of Parliarnent, cannot bring bis case
before us in the way the hon. gentleman
has undertaken to do. it is not a question

of privilege, and. flot being a question of
privilege, it cannot corne up except upon
proper notice. The hon. gentleman has no
right, as I take it, to bring it up in this.
way without notice.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-We want a ruling.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR-I amn arguing a point
of order. The matter, as 1 understand it,
ie one o! very» great public interetthat an officer in the militia of this country,
holding an important office, should be publicely charged with what niight. to say the
least of it, be a crime.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Might be!

It is.

Hon. Mr. GIRRQIR-It is a matter o!
public importance and o! sufficient gravity
to dlaim consideration before the Orders
o! the Day are called. I arn prepared. at
the close ci my remarks, to move the adjournment of the House if necessary in
ord.er to bring tbis matter properly before
the Bouse. 1 arn not as conversant with
the rules of the Senate as I should be, perhaps, but I think I arn within my rights in
dieuesing the malter in the way I have
followed. I asic the ruling cf the Chair.
The SPEAKER-If we read clause 25 of
our rules we find thie:
No notice le required for any of the foiiowing motions:
,For the adjournimelt of the Senate for the
purpose of bringlng Up a question of urgent
public importance (which the mover shall state
on rleing to speak) before the House proceede
to the Orders of the Day.
If the hon. gentleman wants to move the
adjournment o! the Senate fer the purpose
o! bringing 'up a question o! public importance, then the House rnay permit hlmn
to go on.
Hon. Mr. ROSS <Middleton)-I beg to
move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Taylor, that,
the lion. member from Antigonish be now
heard.
Several hon. GENTLEMEN-No, no; order, order!
Hon. Mr. POWER-The hon. gentleman
eannot get over the rule o! the House that
way. This case may be a matter o! some
importance to Col. Morris, but it is not a
matter of urgent pubjic importance, and
il is only in ca*ses o! urgent public importance that a member 'bas the right to move
tihe adjournment of the House without notice.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I would point out
also, in regard to this matter, to satisfy
the conscience of the hon. senator fi--Nova Scotia, that Col. Morris was irever'
mentioned by me. It is true I sd the
word "commanding officer" in laying before this House and the country the condition o! things applicableSeveral hon. GENTLEMEN-Order, order!
The SPEAKER-The -bon. gentleman may
discuss the point of order that has arisen
under rule 25, but he cannot go into the
merits of the question.
.Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I do not want to go
into the merits of the question.
The SPEAKER-The point is this: no
notice is required for a notice of adjournment for the purpose of bringing up a
question of urgent public importance. The
question that arises is whether that is a
question o! urgent public importance?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I contend it is not.

The SPEAKER-I want it proved that it
is urgent.
Hion. Mr. CLORAN-It is very urgent
tliat it should noV be discussed.
Several hon. GENTLEMEN-Order, order!
Hon. Mr. POWER-I do flot yet know
what His Honour the Speaker has ruled.
Does His Honour rule that this is a matter
of urgent publie importance'
The SPEAKER-No, not yet.
Hon. Mr. POWER-It is the duty of the
Speaker of this House to keep order, and if
a question of order is raised, to decide the
question.
The SPEAKER-Yes, it is my duty to do
so. and1 that duty I shall do without being
requested by any one, even by an exSpeaker. To my mind the question is not
urgent. Now you may reverse muy decision.

GAULT DIVORCE CASE.
REPORT 0F COIMMITEE ADOPTED.
Hon. Mr. -ROSS (Middleton) nioved the
adoption of the twenty-fourth report of
the Standing Committee on Divorce, te
.whoma was referred the petition of Andrew
Hamilton Gault, together wi.th the evidence
t.aken before the said committee.
Hon. "Mr. CLOR4N-I shffould like to
know w.hat we are going to concur in. 1
have no evidence on which to base my
judgment.
Hon. Mr. ROSS <Middleton)-The Divorce
Committee have followed the usual practice and&reported to the House -and laid on
the Table ail th1e exhibits and evidence.
It la for the House to Q-ay whether the
evidence shall be printed or not. The
committee are donie with it for the present;
they have returned the evidence to the
Houie 'with their report.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I know where 1
stand *and where ail other lion. members
stand. We are asked to pass iudzment on
a case without evidence. The chairman
tells us it is on the Table, but the table is
not in our possession. Eizhtv-sîx menibers
cannot have that copy at one and the saine
time. It will take a whole session to pass
it around froin one to the other. Why not
print the evidence in this as in other cases?
How can hon. gentlemen pass judgment on
a matter -of vital importance of which they
know absolutely nothing? It would take me
a day or two to ponder over that evidence.
and the samne with the other eighty-five
members of the House. I have no interest

in the niatter, but 1 should like to know
where we stand. Canl thîs honourable Hcuse
be ûa11led upon to ppè judgment without the
evidence beingy placed in the hands of eachi
individu-al member?
Hon. Mr. POWER-The bon. gentleman
Hie takes
15 raising a question of order.
the view that we cannot, proceeding in the
cidinary way, consider this report now, and
on that hie asks the rulingu of the Speaker.
I think the uniformn practice of the House
up to the present tinie has been that when
thie committee do not find in favour of
granting the divorce the evidence is not
printed. The printing of the evidence is a
niatter of some cost. Generally the evidence,
when prînted. is not particularly edifying
in its character, and when the papers are
onq the table of the House any lion. gentieman who wishes to look at theni can see
theni. There is no reason why we should,
contrary to the practice of the house, spend
good mioney in hiaving a document printed.
After ail, the-printing is a mere matter of
convenience. .We might do business without any printing. A great many Houses do.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I cannot agree with
the hon. gentleman with reference ho this
niatter-not that I want the evidence, 1
do not read these cases. The point I want
the Speaker to decide is this: Can the
committee act in one way -in one case and
in another way in another case? Now, the
ex-Speaker telle us that when a committee
make a recommendation-take the Divorce
Committee-tbe House accepts that renonmmendation, or must.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL--I fully
concur in th1e remark made by the hon.,
gentleman froni Halifax, that the hon.
gentleman might save ail the discussion
by moving that the evidence in this case
be printed.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I do not want the
evidence in that case more than any other;
ail I want is a ruling; I want to know
where 1 stand. This committee rejects
We bave no evidence
the petition..
whether that committee acted unanimously or whether it was a majority vote.
The ex-Speaker tells us the evidence in
the case is at the disposai of. the House,
but it is childish to put a copy on the
Table and expeet 86 mien te read it during
the next 24 hours.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL- I
suggest bow the lion. gentleman can get
the evidence.

that it has been almost invariably the

been no exception, for promoters of Bills
of this kind, where thene bas been an adverse report, to withdraw the Bill and
hence dispense with the necessity of
pnînting the evidence.

Does the first part refer -te the -sale of
matches, and the second part -to their use?
Does the first part allow themn to sel
mîatches up to the lst July, 1916, and the
second part allow people to use them?

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-This is the explanation furnished by the Parliamentary
counsel, Mr. Gisborne:
Under the exieting Act (1914, c. 12) the
manufacture, importation, sale and use of
matches manufactured with white phosphorus
was forbidden. The prohibition with respect to
the tiret two, manufacture and importation,
were for'bidden frorn the tiret of January. 1915.
The second two, sale and use, were- forbidden
from the tiret o! January, 1916.

MARICH 21, 1916

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-That is, -the sale
and use were forbidden from the let January, 1916?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, it was
divided into two sections, viz.: the manufacture and importation, and then the sale
and use. Now, the second two, sale and
use, were forbidden from the let January,
1916. The Bill is to extend the tixue within
which white phosphorus matches may be
sold and used. The time is extended to the
first day of January, 1917, and the Bill is
to be retroactive, so as to prevent prosecutions during the period, between the firsat of
January, 1916, and the present time. It
appears that there are considerable stocks
cf white phosphorus matches stili in the
country, and it is to prevent dealers and
shop-keepers from suffering loss. The
manufacture and impartation have already
been stopped.
Hon. Mr. BOLDUC, from the committee,
reported the Bill without amendmnent.

A QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.
The SPEAKER-Before the Orders of the
Day are called I wish to make the fol]owing
declaration as to a question of privilege:
There is on the Offler Paper for to-morrow a notice of niotýon whichi i * to be
submitted te this House. I consider it a
direct attack upon me, based on the assumption that in a. speech at a public
meeting heid in Ottawa on the 27th day of
June last, Ris Honour the Speaker of the
Senate made injuricus and unjustifiable remarks about the members of the Senate.
This motion is a sequence of the readin;
the other day of what was assumed ta 'be
a correct -report of the speech delivered by
me on the aforesaid date. When asked if
the report was correct, I refused to answer
immediately, because I claimed the right
to have two days before being obliged ta
reply. My refusai ta anàswer was taken, by
the lion. gentleman who put tire question,
as an admission that the repcrt was correct,
though I then aet forth that -I was flot rnfusing ta give a definite answer but merely
claiming imy -right te reply at the pro'per
time. The motion now be'fore the House
positively assumes that His Honour the
Speaker of the Sonate made injurions remarkz about the Senate. I might have the
righit te cempiain of the procedure followed
in this case, but 1 rhalnot do se. WVithout
further discussion I shahl give immiediate]y
the reply expected by yeur honeurable
House. My answer is this: The translation
of the remarks att.ributed to nie *wvhich I
have read mn the Debates cf this House, is
flot a correct re.port of my speech. If the
translation la a good one-and I have ne
reason to abelieve it is not-then I may say
that' neither the French report nor the
Enghish translation renders the sentiments
which I expressed in that speech.' I have
been incerrect]y reported.

EXTENSION 0F THE LIFE 0F PARLIAMENT.
Mr. DAVIS-Before the Orders of
Hon.
the Day are called, I desire to ask the
leader of the House a question. Some time
ago this House passed a joint resolution of
both Houses with réference to the extension
of the life of Parlianent. Has the Government ever had any reply since it was passed
and forwarded to the proper au-thorities,
or received any word with reférence to it?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I really cannot
answer my hon. friend with any degree of
certainty. 1 understand. it was forwarded
to England for the purpose of the necessary
législation being enacted to give it the
forcé of law. I shall be very glad to make
turther inquiry about it.

tiens of a lirnjted character have been organized for the purpose of carrying out the
ides, which is embodied in thie legisiation.
If At can be carried ont successfully by the
banks, tbey are ini a very much better position, 1 presume, cwing te their command
of capital, than would amaller orgaizations,
te meet the requirements of the farinera in
the difeérent districts throughout the Dominion ci Canada. I have no doubt that hon.
gentlemen will very heartily approve of the
prineiple of the Bill and that it will reoeive
the second reading.
Hon. Mr: DAVIS-I have lived in the
wsetern part of this country, and been in
the cattie business for a good many years,
and I do not know what agriculture interests have been asking for this. It appears te
nie that it is givin-g another concesion to the
banks te enable thein te get more security.
From my experience, any man who has a
tract ai land which ie cleared, no mortgage
or liens against it, can go 10 the bsnk anid
borrow money if he Je willing to pay such
rates cf interest as the banke charge. The
people of the West are flot asking Parliament te give the banke the right te lend
rnoney on chattel rncrtgage. What they
vwant is cheaper rnoney, and 8 per cent je
net cheaper rnoney. The people of the West
and other parts of the country censider
their security as goed as that ef a railway
corporation, and if a Governent can guarantee the bonds of a railway cornpany te
enable thein te get cheap money, the
fariners do not see why stepa should net be
taken te enable them te borrow rnoney at
4 and 5 per cent instead cf 10 or 12 per cent.
But in tbis case they have asked for bread
and yeu give them a etone. You are givi*ng
the banke a rîght te lend mnoney at 8 per
cent and take a chattel mortgage on the
éorrower's stock. I have ne doubt the banks
would be willing te lend the money at 8
per cent without tbis legielation.
Hon. Mr. DE VEBER-I do net think the
purpose of the change in the Act je what my
hon. friend froin Saskatchewan imagines it
is. We have had in the West hea-pe and
heaps of advice. We have been advised te
go into mixed farming, and every fariner
has been advised te get a few head of cattle,
but many of thein have net hadl the rnoney
te de so. If a farmner 's naine ie good he
can go te a bank and borrow the rneney,
but the loan muet be repaid at the end ef
the year before he can get any more advances. The banks wili net extend the boan

beyond the year, and the farmner muet sell
hie cattie to pay the note. If the boan could
be carried for three years by paying the
intereet yearly, at the end cf the three years
the farmer could pay hie debt frein the increase cf hie stock, and have as rnany cattie
as he had in the firat place. 1 think the
intent cf the Bibl Je te enable the bank te
lend the meney fer more than one year. In
Lethbridge, semeing the neceseity cf sornething of tbis kind, the Board cf Trade induced a number cf ue te join in forming a
general poel, leaving our rnoney in the pool.
The fariners, have paid the intereet, and in
nearly every case vhere it hae been geing
fer three yeare they have paid the principal. I do net think the banke wiii mun any
chance of loeing when they make such loans
if they give the borower an extension cf
tino,'but he could net repay the incney
under the old eyetem.
Hon. Mr. MeS WEENEY-What je the
rate charged?
Hon. Mr. DE VEBER-The regular charge
je 8 per cent.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Thie Bill je in the
intereet cf the farmers, especially in the
West. I dc net knov hov il wili affect
farmers in the East, but rny hon. friend te
my right (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) told mie
that, as he understoed it, in Quebec they
had ne forrn cf chattel mortgage, se that
the fariner ini Quehec wiii net be benefited
by this begislation.
Scine hon. GENTLEMEN-Oh yes.
Hon. Mr. BOeTOCK-I amn gba te know
it je going 4e hebp fa.rmers all over the
country. Rt je begisiation in the right directien, and wili be of Berne assistance te the
fariner. I presurne the interpretatien of my
hon. friend frein Lethbridge je correct, that
the bahke will be allowed te extend such
boans longer than 12 nmenthe. This Bill
alec deals vitb another question which 1
do net think my hon. friend the leader of
the Governnient brought eut exactly. I
understand the firet clause extends the
privilege of iending rnoney te a feamer
on hie seed grain. On a former occasion
we amended the Bank Act te
allow
a bank ite lend a fariner mn<ney te buy
seed grain, taking security on hie crep,
but if rny recoblection je correct, that Act
was te end in 1915. *As I understand, the
firet clause of this Bill etrikes eut the section in that Act which liinited the lime,

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-With. the permission
of the hon. leader of the Opposition, who
moved the adjournnient of the debate, I
propose to take àhis place and say a few
words on the resolutiofl xoved by my hon.
friend f rom Montreal. The other evening
I moved the adjournmerit of this debate,
and made it clear that I was not mueh in
favour of the proposition laid do'wn in this
resolution, for several reasons. In the first
place the 'Prime Minister had already taken
the initiative, a committee has been appointed, and this question has been taken up.
The resolution of council covers the ground
completely. A committee of which my hon.
friend the-leader of the House ie t.he chairman, having been appointed,.1I do not
see'any sense in appointing another cernrnittee cornpoeed o! the same members, to
cover tb.e saine ground. However, as I
said before, il th-is committee proposed by
rny hon. friend is not going to cost the
ccuntry any money I arn not opposed to
it. The trouble is that we have had s0
maniy committees and commnissionls for the
last four or five years in this country that
a great deal o! the public revenue is going
in payment therefor, and I do not ses that
it .has resulted in any !benefit to the people.
WVe have had ail the commissions we require. The object o! the proposed investigation, as laid down by the Prime Minister
and by the 'hon. gentleman from Montreal,
who rnoved this resolution, is a very good
one, but a great many of our people have
peculiar ideas with reference to what is
going to take place in this country after
the war. My hon. f riend who spoke the
other svsning has been called a psssimist
because he sees what is coming. I have
read statements in reliable newspapers that
we are going to have fiftesn millions of
people in this country three ysars after
the war is ended. I should like to know
on what that opinion is based. We have

o! duplicating the committes of which he

Government anàl the members o! the different local Governments sliould get together and take Up this whole question. It
would have a better effect. Legislation lias

present.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-Get prohibition in
the country.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I am nof discussing
prohibition. There is no doubt that agriculture is the basis of ail prosperity in
Canada. You can talk about railroads,
manufacturing establishments, universities
and ail that sort of thing, but you would
have no raiiroads or mines or universities or
anythîng if you did not have the agricultural cornmunity. The farmers are the backbone of the country, from whom all prosperity must emanate, if you are going to
have prosperity at ali. Then why not try
to better the condition o! the people who
are taking the wealtVh froni the soul, instead
of hampering them in their operations?
WhaV do ws find? Everybody has a good
word for the farmers, but. if they ask, for
bread thsy geV a stone. The farmers in our
part of the country have asked permission
to market their produce wherev.-r Vhey xvishi
to, but they are told they cannot do that.
The wealth o! the country wvill coins frorr
ths Northwest in the near future, because
ws have the fertile, arable land. We have
producsd mronderful amounts of grain, and
shahl continue to do so, but our farmers flot
only cannot market their grain where they
could get the most for it, but they are teld

Hon. Mr. POPE-I have liad considerable
difficulty in bringing this question before
the attention cf thi hon. body. With the
various efforts that have been made ta
ohetruet me, ail of which, 1 preaume, are
according to the regulatiens and miles governing tâis hon. body, I have no f ault ta
find. 1 arn not prompted in this matter in
the elightest degtee by any -personal feelsig either fer or against the hon. Speaker
o! this House, et the particular question
with which ho vas dealing vhen he made
the speech in vhich he used the unfortunate utterances which have been recerded
in the public press cf this country. :When
I firet brought up the matter I thought I
had only to cali the attention of the hon.
Speaker ta the report cf hie speech published in !le 'Droit, Le Devoir and soins
other papers vhich I do not produce, ta
have the matter explainéd; therefore, in
order ta call hie attention to this matter I
gave the following netice:
That ho will call the attention of the Senate
te certain remarks sald ta have been made by
Hie Menour our Speaker, accusing the English
members of the Senate of belng fanatics, and
saying aima that he has a letter froni the Prime
Minister which, if read, would force the resignatien of a- member of the Cabinet.

I thouglit it did not matter vhether I

word that je bandied abeut in Canada, unfortunately, tac mucli. It ie a word that
lias been used in the two central provinces
cf Ontario and Quebec toc mucli by public
speakers, by newspapers., and by even sorne
magazine writers. The hon. senator from
North Grey the other day gave us the dictionary definition of the 'word «'fanatio as a man wild with religious frenzy, or

majarity of the hon, gentlemen -Who compose this Ohamber are not in that clas.
Being a native of the province -of -Quebec,
and having live there ail my life-I regret
ta say a very censiderable portion of the
time ini public 11f e-I arn not afraid. of ay
application of the word fanatie ta me as far
as I amn personally conoerned, because I
arn oo weli known ta ail the nationalities
and creede in that province. But the statement attributed ta the Speaker has a bigger significance than that, being retroactive and comprehensive, and I regret sinoerely that on my simply.pointing out the
mattet he did not at once seize the opportumity te make an explÉnation. However,
he saw fit ta taise a technical objection,
which. le had a perfect right ta do, as far
as I underotand, ini view of decisions by
the several Speakers who have been oalled
upon fremn Lime ta ime ta rule upon sucli
question.
Referring ta, the Debates, I find that the
hon. Speaker rose in the Ohamber and aaid:
'«I consider it «.direct attack upon me."

the assumption that In a speech at a publie
meeting held in Ottawa on the 27th day of June
last, Hia Honour the Speaker cf the Senate made
injurlous and unjuetifiable remarks about'the

assumned te be a correct report of the speech delivered by me on the aforesaid date. When
asked If the report was correct, I refused te answer immediately, because I claimed the rlght to

refusai ta answer was taken, by the hon. gentlemnan who put the.- question as an admission,

and energy, and especially as a man who
bas done more to bring bis party into power
in the province of Quebec than any manl
in either House. I arn asbamed to see that
not a man among bhis political friends ini
this Heuse rises to defend hini, especially
after his effort to smooth away the unfortunate aspersion eontained. in the resolution of hie political friend. I have no

thought that the matter was over, and that
the hon. member for Compton oiught, as is
custornary in the Senate and the other
HQuse, to take the answer of a ininister, or
a member, to a question es final. But
thougb I have no brief to defend the
Speaker, I would not have it said that nobody on this sîde of the House, when there
is not a man to rise on the other side, bad
the courage to defend his friend. I was
merely going to raise a point of order when
I uaw the bon. member for Compton standing up to proceed with his resolution. The
point of order in my rnind1 was to the effeet
that the Speaker, having given an answer
without any protest at the trne, it ought
to have been taken as ending the incident.
But I was not sure of the point, and
thought it better to let the hou. member
go on with his motion. Speaking about
pie, I would say to the hon. gentleman for
Comptonl that if he bas good pie-I mean
a seat in this House-b'a owes it very rnuch
to the Speaker who fought éo bard in our
province to place bis party where it is now

jectionable words referred to in the resolution. That denial might possibly apply to
some other portion of the speech. Now,
what the House really wants to know is if
his -honour the Speaker used words derogatory to the niembers of the Sonate. I
therefore think that the opportunity ehould
be given his honour of categorically denying that hie used those words, and that we
should not proceed with the discussion of
this motion until that opportunity is given
his honour.
Several hon. MEMBERS-Hear, hear;

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Therefore, if my
hon. friend wilI permit this proposition to
mould itself into the forni, say. of a resolution I would suggest that the Hon. Sir

the Speaker to ask bum if lie -bas used
words derogatory to the Senate, as coinplainedý of in the motion, and then report
to this House.

Hon. Mr. CLORÂ&-I would suggest that

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Then will my

Hon. Mr. POWER-The hion. gentleman
said this would apply chiefly in the province
of Quebec, as I understand it. It seems to
me that if the notice je put in anr English
newspaper and the debtor happens to le a

Hon. Mr. BOLDLUC-Does the clause not
state that it is to be published in two newspapers, one French and one Eng.lish?
Hon. Mr. POWER--Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-Not in the Bill

Hon. Mr. POWER-There is nothing
of tha kind in the Bili, but i the Bank Act
there is a provision of that sort. It seems

ing at the fact 'that a similar mistake was
made when the three cent postage rate was
introduced, my own feeling is that there
must be some freak officiai in the Post Office
Department by whonî the Postmaster General is misguided. I trust that the Government will be able in a short timne te furnish
the public with a three cent stamp of which
it may be literally said that "he that runs
may read. " The present on is net that
kind.

Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Jt seems te me that
the last innovation is in the wrong direction. It is net an impTovement, but rather
a reverse step, when you remember.that se
many twe cent stamps are required-a one
cent stamp for a paper, a two cent stamp
for receipts, cheques and many other papers,
and you require a three cent stamp forI
letters. Il you make a three cent stamp,
and it should be generally carried by business men, then they are often likely te be
short of the two cent tamp, and of the one
cent stamp. The first arrangement, it
seems te me, was very much better than
the one which prevails at the present tinie,
because when business men carried two
cent stamps and one cent stamps, as they
usually do, they couid use a twe and a one
for a letter, and a twe cent stamp fer a -receipt or a cheque. The two cent and the
one cent stamps could be' used for the

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED: I shaîl take the

what should be done under the circumstances. 1 have no doubt that the designer
of this stamp, in concluding upon the design of the present three cent stamp. considered that he had solved the problein
very successfully; but apparently he has,
not. So far as my hon. friends question is
concerned:
If It la the Intention of the Government te so

I f ancy that that will be too difficuit, a
subject to undertake.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-For the first
Urne I have exaxnined the present three
cent stamp, and il must confess it is a most
extraordinary design. If the hon. leader of
the Government will look at it, I think he
hirnsel! will draw the attention of the Postmaster General te the advisability of issuing a decent three cent stanxp.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Many people, and I
amn one of them, buy ail one cent stamps,
and then they are sure not te deceive or te
be deceived. On a circular they put one
cent, on a cheque two stampm; on a letter
three stamps. With only one cent stamps
there need be ne mistake.

would be the Arctic Pilot, which I proceeded ta get from the British Admiralty,
but I arn sorry to say that 1 did not flnd
any more information in the Arctic Pilot
than we already possessed. 1 may be perhaps forgiven if 1 repeat some of the things
that I have been saying se often in the
Senate on this question. Nine years have
passed since I brought up the subject in
this RHouse, and when I look around this
Chamber and ose the great number cf new
senators who have corne in since that time
it shows the advisability of re-stating sme
of the facts. In ail those fine long years
I have followed up this question, have read
everything that has been written on the
subject, and have always taken a very deep
interest in the navigation cf our northern
seas. I believed then, and I believe new,
that the route from Hudson bay through, the
straits to the Atlantic, will neyer be cernmercially practicable. Therefore I think it
is right ta caîl for those documents, and
to ask whether it is opportune at the present time, with a large deficit staring this
country in the face, ta go on with this extraordinary expenditure, which was estimated under a former Administration at
a certain sum but which, according te the
figures ta be brought down, will be found
te more than double the original estimate
of the cost. There is the great expense cf
building 450 odd miles cf railway from Le
Pas te Port Nelsen, threugh an uninhabited
country, in which for the first 150 or 200
there may be here and there littie
-miles
spaces fit fer agriculture, but which for
the last 200 miles nearing the shores of
Hudson bay, is absolutely useless, net
even having any valuable timber. I want
te say that I have ne pelitics in this matter. I know f ull well that this work was
begun by a fermer Administratien; but,
perhaps that Administration was net as
well informed as it sheuld have been when
it undertoek this preject. But new that
this werk bas been geing en year after

great difficulty attending the carryin)g out
ef the enterprise. The railway, wvhen cernpleted, can only possibly de business for a

one knows, Port Nelsen and Hudson baý
and the straits are abselutely clesed ti,
.navigation for eight or nine menths ini
the year, and during the remainder of the
year navigation by this toute is ment dangerous. -It seems te me, therefore, that it

weuld be enly right fer the Government te
stay its hand, for a few years at any rate,
hefore spending more money on the project, and especially on the development of
Port Nelson. I have hers a map which,
with the permission cf the House, I shal
ley on the Table and invite hon, gentlemen to look at it, since we are here te
look after the public interest. I ask bon.
gentlemen to look at this map, and say il
they know of any harbours in this country
or elsewhere which present such difficulties
in providing terminal facilities. The map
speaks for itself. On the main shore lime
the water in shailow, and when the tide recedes there is actually a mile and a quarter
ef abselutely dry land left at low tide.
Then the channel cf the Nelson river, from
its mouth for twenty long miles up stream,
is so shallow that a channel' will have te
be dredged nearly ail the way. The deep
water begins twenty or twenty-two miles
frem the ceast, and from there ta the shore
a channel will have te be dug through the
depesits cf silt that *have been carried
down by the Nelson river; and this dredging will have ta be done every year at
great expense. in order to keep the channel
open. Owing to the permanency of our
tenure of office in the Senate we, have the
satisfaction of being able ta follow up
questions like this, and become thcroughly
familiar with them. This in essentially a
matter whioh this House should look inte
carefully. In the other Ohamber where
they have so many things «te occupy their,

this thoroughly. No one seema te pay any

is completed I dlaim that it will be of ne
commercial benefit, and the people of the
Northwest, who have been advocating this
enterprise in ail sincerity, perhaps, weuld
net advocate its completion new if they
were better informed on the subjeot. The

one by Commander Lowe, and another by
Commander Wakeham, you wiil find there
is ice in the straits every month of the
year, snd there are terrible etorms about
the middle af Aug.ust. It has been impossible ta enter Hudson Straits before the
middle ai July every year. The etraits are
550 miles long, and there is a current
semetimee 9 miles an Ïhour running through
them with the ebb and flow of Vbhe tide.

Now we all know the peculiarities of the
tide. It is not changed underneath at the
same time it changes on the surface, therefore a tremendous iceberg rising 40 or 50
feet or more above the surface, and probably extending down below the surface ten
times that number of feet will be carried in one direction and the surface
ice in another, and woe to the vessel
that is caught in the surface ice,

Hon. Mr. WATSON-It is not ofien I take
exception ta the remarks of the hon. gentleman, but on this subject I do. I have some
sympathy with the hon. gentleman's idea
that at the present time the Government
should mot spend a very large amount of
money at Port Nelson, but so far as the
building of the Hudson Bay Railway is
concerned, I think he is a little laie in
the day ta suggest that it should be abandaned. He says it is a good job that some
of us are constamtly in public lif e and able
ta look back and advise the mew-comers as
to what has taken place in the past. The
firsi committee of the House of Gommons
upon which I had the honour of being a

SENATE

representetive cf the people was in 1883
when I was a member cf the cornmittee
called fer by the late Joseph Royal for
the purpose cf getting information on the
navigation of Hudson Bay. At that time
we had the power te caîl for persons and
papers. We had the Bedford whalers, 'whe
h.ad traver-sed that route for yaars, and
we obtained all the information we could
get. At that time we carne te the conclusion that the navigation cf Hudson Bay
and strait8 was practical for four rnonths
cf the year.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-That is net eneugh.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-Well, that bas been
incmeased wonderfully by modern inventions. We know that Hudson bay is as
open as the Atlantic or the Pacific, and
the Hudson straits are 60 miles wide witbeut any obstruction in them, and clear
open watem, except for ice certain seasons
cf the year. There is ne doubt about the
navigation. No person claims that Hudson
strait is full cf ioe at a.ny season cf the year.
One cf the inventions helpful te navigation
te which I refer is wireless telegraphy. A
vessel coming inte Hudson bay wishing
te know if there is open water through the
straits, can be advised by wireless if they
can ceme through, which would have the
effect 'of lengthening the season two or
three mionths. It bas been suggested that
vesspls can go in there from six te eight

Hon. Mr. WATSON--Those wrho make

te stering wheat at Port Nelson, the people
cf the Northwest have edvoceted that as a
means cf gettiug additionel value for their

there then on thse prairies, as it is sometirnes stered in Sasketchewan. The railways have had to put an embargo on it. 1

in regard to the location cf the terminal.

The sarne objection that is urged against

moted firat and promoted by ahi our Governments. 1 notice that in another place a
member cf the Government discussing the
question cf f ree wheat claimed that we
should manufacture ail our wheat in
Canada, take ail the proceeds in Canada
and hîve within ourselves. That cannot be
done. If Canada is te progress she must
have wider and freer relations with the eutaide world. It is now about forty years
since Canada adopted the pretective policy,
and during that time the agriculturists of
this country have, te my mind, been handicapped; they have net had a fair field or
a fair show; and the agricultural interests
have been handicapped at the expense cf
the manufacturers, who have been building
up the industries of Canada under a prctective tariff. To my mind that should bie reversed. I think the first interest should be
that of the agriculturists. Most cf the small
tewns and larger cities have offered extra
inducements te secure mar;ufacturing industries; they are off ered aid in the way cf
protection by the Government, while municipalities offer exemption f rom taxation,
f ree sites and se on, which gives them an
advantage over the farmer. They are therefore able te pay hîgher wages while paying
less taxes, and the result is that young
men are induoed te go off the farm te the
tewns and cities and engage in manufacturing rather than stay on the land. Now,
there is ne question that the one who produces the most wealth in this country is
the farmer. He takes it eut cf the ground"
not necessarily -"mining it eut cf tbe
ground-and the saccessfui farmer produces
more wealth, man for man, than any manufacturing industry we have in Canada. For
that reason 1 arn glad te zee that the
mever of this resolutiof placed agriculture
before industriai and trade interests. I
trust this committee will be appointed, and

and I trust that when they de make a report

past and put agriculture first and industrial interests second.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-The motion thiat
iny lion. friend fromn De Salaberry lias
Hon. Mr. WATSON.

placed before the House is, 1 think, a very
important one at the present time. The
questions with which this committee will
have to deal are very wide, and they affect
the whole interests of the country. My hon.
friend in moving bis motion quoted the
Order in Council drawn by the Government
ini appointing- the Economic Commission of
which the hon. the leader of the Government
in this House is cbairman. Any hion. gentlemn who lias studied that Order in Counceil
will at once realize the wide scope
of that commission and the enormous
amount of work that they must have
before them if they are going to deal with
the questions referred toi in that Order in
Council. The whole scope of that commissien is very wide, and I have no doubt my
hon. friend the leader of the Governient
realizes the tremendous ameunt of work
that hias been placed on his shoulders and
those of the members of the comissqion.
Therefore I think that the motion made
by my hon. friend from De Salaberry, that
a committee of this House should be appointed to hèlp consider one or two of .those
questions, is a very wise one, because we
cannot pay toc much attention to those very
important questions that affect the country.
It has been said that we ought to bend al
our energies te the pushing forward of the
war. 0f course, everybody agrees with that
statement, but at the same time if we were
only te devote ail our energies te that particular work, and not think about what we
are going to de when the war is over, we
should find that we were in a very bad and
We have to"consider
awkward position.
to-day what .is goîng to happen to this
country as soon as this war is over; and
although we cannot tell what the position
is going to be either in this country or in
Europe when the war ends, as no one at
the present moment can tell when it is
going to finish or what the conditions are
going to be whien it is finished, at the same
tinie, we can consider the conditions that
exist at the present moment. In Canada
for a long timie we have been doing a great
deal to encourage the agricultural industry
of the country. Each Government in turn
lias done its best te develop the agricultural industry and te increase the production fromn the land as much as possible.
First of ail, they have established experimental farms, secondly, they have arranged
lectures at farmers' meetings ail through
the country for the purpose cf educating the
farmer. They have helped the industry by
further division cf the Department cf Agri-

culture inte various branches-the dairying
industry, the work of inspection cf the
varicus parts cf the country, then the fruit
industry-and the amount cf wcrk that has
been given te the placing before the farmers
the desirabiiity cf their using and planting
the right kind cf seed and watching the
germination cf the seed-,all those questionh
the Governinent have deait with, and the>'
have been dcing a great deal tc educate the
farming ccmsnunity ail thrcugh the country
cn these varicus questions. Then again,
in the case cf the live stock industry, the
work dcne by the Gcvernment has ail been
for the purpose cf educating the f armera
te carry cn a better system. But, nctwxthstanding ail this, unfcrtunately the agriculturai industry has net shown the saine
anqcunt cf progress that we might have
expected in this'ccuntry at the preserit turne
as the resuit cf the attention that has been
given tc pushing the education of the fariner
and the farming industry thrcughout the

fcrrnerly, the quin.tity has actually decreased. I regret ver>' mudh te gay' that
in a large num-ber of cases in other matters
relating te agriculture the saine condition
can be shown; and if we investigate the
question of labour, we find that t>he ameunt
of labour .empioyed b>' fariners te-day is
not as great as it was seine years age. The
reason for that apparently is that the ceuntry has progressed and the price cf farim
labour has inereased cf late years se that
the f armer bas found that he h-as net been
able te go -iii for such intensive farming as
he formerly did. The resuit shows that the
fariner cf to-day is net empleyîng the saine
amount cf labeur per hundred acres as he
%as some years ago. This, cf course, dees
not help te better prodimtien in the agricultural indus'try, and I think that it is
a question that this comnitittee and the
commission cf 'which rny hon. .friend is
chairman sihould ver>' carefully consider.

Then again, we corne te the question cf
the market fer the fariner. The market
to-day is a ver>' important cone ail through
tlis country. We have the farmers in the
Northiwest to-day with large quantities of
wheat on Ïhand, -but on acceunt of the exracrdinary conditions ln transportation they
are unable te get their grain te market, and
alse the>' are net -able, on account cf the
conltions under whicéh they are ýplaced,
to borrow rncey on that grain. This ties
up the whole situation froim the agricultural point cf view, and in the samne way
in British Columubia 'the question cf market

minds oïf the fruit grower and the farmer
generally. H-ad it net been fer the fact

also for the lurnbermari and others who are

I read an interesting article an the question ai banking, which. I desire ta quote ta
a amali extent. In this article, which vas
written by Mr. Win. Olson on the promotion of national industry alter the war, he
points out that the British banks adhere
ta legitimate banking, and that the German
banks are nat banks in the British sense,
but great industry promoting institutions,
and he further goes on ta say:

And we might add in 'this country the develaping and opening up -of new portions

Then he goes on ta say:

gtereotyped reply, «IThat la flot a banker's busiuezs."

That is an important point. IL shows the

has certain advantages, but it also has disadvantages in this way, that the larger corportions, whose directors and those immediately.responsible for the policy of the
bank, cannot possibly be in such close touch
with the different portions of the country,
,and they are apt not ta consider the building up of any particular part of the country
in the saine way that would be done by a
smaller bank whose interests were in that
part of the country. This question is therefore one that is going ta interest not only
this country but also Great Britain and
the whole of the British Empire as soon as
this war is over, and 1 have brought it to
the attention af the House in this way. and
think it is one that this committee should
consider and look inta. 1 should like to
quote also the resolution that was passed
at the meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom, held on the 29th February. 1916.
This particular meeting of the Association
of the Chamber of Commerce was called
in EnglaDd the other day, and a large number of resolutions were senmL in froin ail
over the country ta the secretary, and certain resolutions vere selected froma thoEe
as the most accurate and the 'best resoluLions representing the ideae ci the différent
chambers assooiated together for this purpose. The resolutian. that -was chosen >ta
deal with this banking -question reads as
iollows:
Thas Him MaJestym Government be asked ta
take Inta consideration the present banking
system in -this country (Great Britain) with a
view of ascertaining whether any steps can be
-taken ta further facilitate and encourage Industri-al -enterprise.
Severai supplementary resolutions in this
division refer to the assistance rendered to German commerce by credit banks and sirnilar Inlstitutions, and deprecate facilities being in the
future given to enemy banks ta operate in the
United XKlngdom.
I quote that resolution as showing- the
feeling of the people in England at the present time on this whole question. They
h-ave corne ta realize that although their
banking system, as a banking system, is a
very good one, at the samne time it is not
supplying the necessary credit for the development of the trade, and industries of
the country. 1 move that the debate be

a Mllitary

Court-Martial held ln Halifax. N.S.. in connection with said escape.
.And wili inquire of the Government whether

any criminal proceedings were taken or are
contemplated against the ofifcers in charge of
said camp?

He said: The matter referred te in the
inquiry was first .brought before the House
on the 14th day o~f this month, by the
hon. member for Victoria division (Hon.
Mr. Cloran), w'ho made very serious charges
against the officer in charge ot the detention camp at Amherst, 'N.B. I was naturally shocked at the time te think that any
person holding the position that that officer
occupied should have ibeen se remias in bis
duty as the hon. gentleman frem Victoria
division alleged. I 'made cit 'my business te
make some inquiry into the matter and, in
order te present te the -House scsme facts
which I think should be presented in order
te clear bis character and re-establish his
reputation if it has 'been taken away frem
hini (wMich I very much doubt) by the remarks of the hon. gentleman, I have seen
fit to address this Chamber very briefiy on
this matter. The hon. gentleman tram Victoria division in his speech, te which I
have already referred, used these words:
It le a wei known tact, flot to the general

speaking of Senlator Dennis who had asked
a question which the hon, gentleman declined to answer. The hon. gentleman then
proceeded:
The other statement la this. that instead of
being shot the commanding officer of that camp
was aentenced. to 12 years ln the penitentlary.
So you see, hon. gentlemen, that the hon.
member for Victoria after having this poor
officer shot, then sentenced him to 12 years
in the penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-After he was shot.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR-Further on he !,ays:
Prisoners of war, our bitter enemies. are flot
only allowed to escape, but can pay $50 or
$100 for belng aliowed te escape from the de-

public of the Dominion. but te the people living
in the neighbourhood of the Amnherst detention
camp that Germans have escaped, and what la
more lamentable, ver. alloved and encouragedl
te escape, by the commanding officer ln control,
of that camp. Trhat ls a very grave and serions
condition of things, which I vith six or zeven
aenatorz in ibhis honourabie HoLse, endeavou-red
te confront.

The hon. gentleman did net see fit te
name the senaters who 'were associated
witbi hini in his very grave a.nd laudable
purpose, and on account of that tact they

mill net be entitled, and are net te be given
the credit which accrues te the hon. gentleman for the speech which he made on that
occasion. Further on he used these words:The statemnent has been broadly made, flot by

a newsboy in the street singing out his, papers,
but by hon. senators on the floor of Ibis House,
by ministers and ex-ministers of the Crown,
that the officer responsible for this condition of
things ln the Amherst detention camp vas shol
by order of a court-martial held ln Halifax.

That surely must have been known to thE
people et Nova Scotia and te the neigh.
bouring people ot New Brunswick. Furthet

responsible.

So you see that the charges made against
this officer were of a very serious naturt.
On another occasion, later on, the hon.
gentleman spoke again upon this same question, and said he was sorry that he had
been misuniderstood in connection with the
charges he had made against Col. Morris.
He said:
Col. Morris, one of the Empire'a soldiers. a

man with a reputatioui as an honest, honourable, upright citizen. and with a record as a
soldier that does hlm credit and bis country
I neyer

named any oflicer particularly as responsible
for this condition of thIngs ln that detention

put hlm up as a man of straw to say that there
was nothing against CoL 'Morris. I neyer said
there vas. I did flot know Col. Morris, and
bave no intention of naming him, flot kunowing

Evidently the hon. gentleman had made
some inquiry into this niatter, and found
that his statements, which were founded
upon newspaper reports and anonymous
letters, were net justified, and he' deemed
it his duty te say something to offset the
injury which he had done to the good nanie
of this officer. I give him credit for bis
apology upon that occasion, and for his
repentance as an hon. gentleman suggested,
but atter aIl it may be that while the
charges which were made by the hon. member against this offleer have been published
throughout the cou.ntry, possibly the act
of repentance of the hon. member, on the
occasion to which I refer, has neyer been
mentioned in the press, and this officer may
be stili lying under the charges tfhat were
made against him on that occasion. Speakin- for myseif, I think it would have been
far better had the hon. gentleman waited

MiARCH 30, 1916

untîl the papers in connection with this
matter were brought down, I say it would
have been better, wiser and more generous
for him to have waited before making
charges of this kind about a man like Col.
Morris, than whom I believe there is no
more honourable, no braver or truer officer
in the wholo British service. Now I might
say that Col. Morris has a very distinguished record in the service, as the following statement will show:

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR-I arn afraid the
hion. gentleman will have to go down and

Hon. Mr. OLORAN-WelI. that is supposed to be stated in the report. I want to
know.

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR-I have not read the
report. Now, if the lion. gentleman will
possess his soul in patience for a few
minutes, I shall read the opinion of the
court as it is mont pertinent to this inquiry.
The length of the tunnel is given here.
Proceedings of Court of inquiry-Escape of
Prisoners of War, Amherst.
Finding.
The court having heard the evidence and
baving examined the locus is of the mind that
twelve prisoners escaped between 6.30 p.m. on
the 17th inst., and one on the l8th inst., and
that some of the escaped prisoners left on the
Maritime Express from Amherst et about 8
p.m. and the remainder by the St. John Express
at about 1.30 p.mi.
The prisoners made their escape through a
tunnel which. they dug by breaking off the lock
from. the sand room door and replacing it with
one which they purchased, thus being qble to
enter the sand room at any time during t)4e
day. when on being Iocked ln by their confederates they worked without being disturbed.
At night they entered the trap door ln the prisoners' lavatory, marked A on the. attached
plan, and after having worked et the wall between the lavatory and sand roomn from botb
sides, made a passageway and were thus able
to work et the tunnel both day and night.
The tunnel extended about fifteen yards, cornIng to the surface just in the rear of the coal
shed et a point which the sentries in the
vicinity. on a snowy night such as the one of
the escape, could not see.
The court la of opinion1. That there ia no evidence to show that any
officer, N.C.O. or man was corrupted or bribed

to assist the prisoners liiescaping.
2. The constant changlng of officers. N.C.O.'s
and men of the Internmeflt Camp Staff and the
difficulty of adapting the present building with
is outbuildings for the purpose of a prison,
have been contributory factors In the prisoners'
escape.
3. The tîme between 5 p.m. and 8 arn. is too
long without a roll call.
4. That the hole under the trap door in the
lavatory should have been regularly inspect.ed.*
5. That the sand roomn and other unoccupied
rooms withln the camp should have been inspected periodically.
6. That the police supervision at night was
It should flot have been disconnot suficient
tinued between il p.m. and reveille.
T. That there has flot been sufficiently carefui supervision of the purchasing of articles by
prisoners outaide the canteen sales. 1'risoners

fui supervision of an officer.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR.

8. That there appears to.be no proper metbod
of lssuing keys and taking receipts for them by
the Provost Sergeants or Corporals on being
appointed to or relieved of their positions.
Under the present systemn If a key le lost or
even given to a prisoner. it would appear toi
the court to be impossible to definitely lix responsibility for its custody.
9. The Instructions to the police escort taking the prisoners to the dentist are too Indefimite. They should be ln writing.

MOTION WITHDRÂWN.

Hon. Mr. LOU.GHEED-I explained yesterday that owing to the incorporation in
the present Act of a certain clause in the
Canada Shipping Act which applies to this
Act, the Harbour Commissioners are pre-iluded from iqnpositng such substantial toils
as will -permit of their administering the
harbour properly, and it ie therefore proposed to leave out the lines in the present
Act making that provision.

The Order of the Day was called:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the mo-

tion of the Hon. Mr. Pope, seconded by the
Hon. Mr. Taylor:
That this flouse deeply-regrets that ln more

where chattel mortgages and bis of sale
are not in force by virtue of a statute-and
1 understaind that to be the case in Quebec-we have laid down a procedure whieh
will take the place o~f the procedure
adopted in the other provinces where bills
of sale are in force. 3o.nsequently, if the
hon. gentleman will look at the Bill1 he
will seé that the subsection which we are
amending bas only reference to a province
where bills of sale cannot be used. Wre

Hon. Mr. BOLDUC-I may also say the
expense of publication will surely be met
by the debtor, and when a man is unable
to pay the amouint he has borrowed, and
has given a chattel mortgage, ii will be
better for hinm to pay only for the notice,
and to do away with the publicatio n in the
newspaper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I should like to
look into the matter a littie further.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-In that case I
would be willing to let the Bill stand until
to-morrow. 1 might say the Finance Department do not approve -of the amendment;
it is something unique to be introduced into
the Bank Act, and it is thought that the
notice the bank will give by posting up a
notice in a post office will be very much
more effective than a notice published in a
newspaper some distance away.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-For myseif I
should be satisfied with a notice in the post
office.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The amendment provides for bath. That covers the ground.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Of course, the
debtor will pay for it. Il expensive advertising is to take place without being effective, we have te take into consideration that
the debtor will have to pay for it eventually.
Hon. Mr. WATS0N-I think the post
office notice is better.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I think so, too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I understand
the hon. gentleman from De Sala'berry, who
moved this amendment, would like ta discuss the matter; therefore I would suggest
that the committee rise and report progress.

Hon. Mr. WATSON-What about lawThat the Standing Conmittee on Publie yers?
Buildings and Grounde have power te consider
and report on the plans propesed for the reconstruction of the Parlisment Building, and
ama te act in canjunction with any other erninittee whatsoever deaUng witb the sme subject-mnatter.

Ho said:, The matter ta which I propose
ta eaU attention is one which, 1[ suppose
strictly speaking, should ho deait with by
the Minister af Publie *Works. That minister is in the last resort resaponsible, but
the Sonate are sufficiently intorested in the
reconstruction af the Parliarnent Buildings
ta express an opinion on the matter. Inasrnuch as nearly one-half of the reconstracted building will ho oocupied by the
future generation of senatars, what we
think about it ehould have same weight
with the Governrnent. Somebody representing the Sonate should have a word ta
say with reference ta this important work
in which they are se rnuch intereeted. Hon.
gentlemen rnay say that eGhe plans of the
proposed reconstruction were on 'exhibition in the roorn of the hon. ïMinister of
Public Works at the other end of the building. That is a fact. These plans were there
for a few heurs, and rny hon. friend from
Moncton tells me that they were alse at
this end of the building, but if e, .1 have
net -had the good fortune ta sec them. I
wvas juet going te say that the plans are
very handserne, and some cf the thinga
they show are matters we should alI approve of. For instance, the plans show
that there are ta be, in the reconstructed
buildings, staircases leading all the way

hon, gentlemen, when a building is ta ho

to use -that building, or who have been
using it, if it is -a case of alteration, as it is
in the present instance, know botter from
the practical experience of years what it

SENATE
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-There
is one in the Imperial Parliament.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Another thing: I
think it was stated that the intention was te utilize the *Library building as a reading room. Now, I suppose the
Library is about the finest Toom in the whole
Dominion of Canada, and the proposai te
unde*rtake to use that roomn just as a reading room is one that will nlot appeal to a
mani of culture. One or two -other points I
wish to say a word about: When the addition was made te the Gommons end of the
building a few years ago, there was one
thing which I think every one feit, and that
was that there was a great want of euitable
committee rooma for the business of the
Commons. The fruth was that the Railway
Committee room of the House of Gommons
upon the third floor was se large and its
acoustic properties were s0 imperfect, that
it was really a very unsuitable place for the
meetings of eommittees, and because bhe
Gommons were rather aggressive, bhey had
taken "p8ssion-of two oommittee zooms
which really belonged te the Senate, the
comgnittee reoms east of the old tower, and
the Sonate was pushed out of tlhose rooms.
When the addition was made some few
yeara ago one would have bhought that the
first thing that-would have been done was
te have supplied good committee rooms for
the House of Gommons. In8tead of that
there was not a single committee room supplied. There were sitting zooms and business -offices for the members cf the Coimens, but not a single committee zoom.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-Except the big
Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The Railway Committee room was there before; the only addition made te the Gommons building at thiat
time which could be looked upon as being
used for public purposes was the restaurant.
1 trust that a similar mistake will not be
made now. It is very desirable, cf course,
that members cf both Houses should have

members can, if neces6ar>', get meals.
and I found that the architeet proposed to
put that lift just inside the main door of
the Parliament Buildings on the right band
aide, where it was actually put. 1 pointed
out te hlm that while lie thouglit it was
more symnietrical to have the lift there
opposite the iift on. the Commons end, if
we were te have only one lift it ehould be
put where it -would be used by officers and
mnemàbers of the Senate, and that is the
place where it would lead up te where the
principal officers have their offices, and
where a number of. senators b2ave their
zooms. The architect looked upon me as
more or les cf a barbarian, laoking culture, although lie was net a Geriman, afld
he put the lift where hon. gentlemen kxiow
it was placed. The resuit was that as far
as regards the officers and the bullc of the
members of the lEouse who wiehed te go
troni the ground floor up te the next floor
above, it was pracbically of ne use. It took
as long te get around te where the lift was
located as it did te go te the other staircase and walk up. I mention this tLe illuetraIe the f act that arohitects' views are

on exhibition looked very nice, indeed, but
pradtically Ihey gave only the exterior cf

interior, but 1 may mention soine cf the
things that we hear. I have eeen it etated
in, th. newspapers, I think, as having been
mentioned in the House cf Gommons, that
in. future there will b. no living rooms for
the Speakers of the two Houses. I do net
propose te discuss Ihat question, because
it is a very doubtful problein, but I bhink
that the proposai te t.ake away bthe zesidential rooms f rom the Speakers cf the two
Houses is a very questionable polie>'. That
is one cf the things that the committee
miglit consider. Then, again, it bas been
alleged that there is te be no restaurant in

first time that 1 spoke in regard to it I said,
what I amn prepared to repeat here to-day,
that if mnan's ingenuity had been set to

devise one that would more effectually produce that result. What did they do to yenThey made a subtilate that building?
terranean passage, 75 yards long, where it
was damp and at Urnes wet, and there was
a constant decaying of vegetable matter ail
the tîme; then with fans they drew the air
from the outside, through that long underground passage into the building, and, alter
drawing it, heated and circulated it through
the building. And that is the system that
experts thought was stamped with perfection. Now, I do not think there is a medical
man who bas ever given the subject oi ventilation reasonable thouglit, who would
waste 15 minutes considering it without
deciding that it was absurd. Put a thousand
people into this reem, with the temperature

suggest to any unie -the wi&dom of providing
exits abover te carry off the impure air?
Instead of that, fans were arranged to
bring the air down again and send it eut
throiigh th-e long passages. That was' the
system ini operation until the day the building was bur'ned down. Could any one think
of a poorer device for~ providing ventilationé
True, tbere 'were some windows up near the
top of the building, but instead of the cold
air coming ini that way, the hot air was
foreed out. The cold air would naturally
corne in [below, nearer the ground, being
heavier than the hot air, and the hot air
[rom the respirationýs of the human lungs
being hotter and charged ivith carbon,
would niaturally go out above. That would
suggest the wisdom of getting cold, air from
as near the ground level as possible. That
is just what neyer was done. In looking
over the plan that was submitted.to us the
jother day, I -asked, "Is there any provision
made for a better s-stem of ventilation
than the one adopted in the old building«"'
'One of the architeets said, "Yes, it is very
much better." 1 said, "What device have
you? Are you 'bringing in the air froua eutside above ground"? Hie said yes. 1
asked, "Where are the windows?" Hie

to look over the plan carefully you found
that ail those -windows are to 'be in the

corridor around the chamber, and a row
of roins outside that corridor; therefore,
you can net have' -the outgide windows

ean only open into the rooms, and fromn
the >rooms into the corridor. Prs.ctically, the
systemi of ventilation is much the saine as
the old one, in se far as any viritue might
accrue fremin bringing pure air f rom, the outside at the proper place. Thexi look at the
lighting of this building which we now
occupy. It is lighted by a imn who
assumes te be an authority on lighting.

The Prime Minister bas already nominated
three members fromn the Conservative side
of Parliarnent, and 1 understand that Sir
Wilfrid Laurier bas been asked to nominate
three other menibers. Up to a day or two
ago Sir Wilfrid had not doue ao. It is ta
be hoped that no lime will be loet in indicating his wish as to who those members
shall be. I have no doubt it will be the
intention of Sir Wilfrid ta nominale one cf
those thTree from the Senate. I might say
that I have already been asked by the Prime
Minister to act as one. I amn sure that committec will be only toc glad to receive suggestione fromn either branch of Parliament
as le the structural features, or as te the
details in carrying out the work which is iu
view. The object of *the Government is
purely that of making thase buildings not
only an ornarnent to the Dominion cf Canada, but cf making themn most useful for
the purposes for which they were designed,
namely the accommodation cf Parliament.
It must ual be averlooked thal there ie
more or less limhitation of room in the buildings, and in dealing with the features mentioned by my bon. friend frcm Halifax as
to tJhe absence of 8peakeré' residences in
the building, that feature will ual be overlooked se far, as <providing neoessary

day Lord Haldane, speaking in England,
made these remarks:
I want te aound a warning of what le in store
for us. I amn more afraid of an engine for concQuest in peace time. whlch the Germazia. were
busy prejartnçr befare the war, than I arn of the

42-centimetre guns. This engine Is educational.
The most modern torm of continuation school la

book school and It behooves us ta be prepared
for -the shock of this competition whlch la coinIng after the war. Germany is training the
youth of the land In special skiIled trades. ta
outdistance competitors throughout the world.

Probably no man knows more about what
has been donc by the German people in that
line than Lord Haldane, who has given
great attention ta the condition ai things ini
that country; and I think that his reconimendation ta the English people alsa applies
ta Canada-that if they want ta be in a
position ta compete in the markets ai the
world, they have ta do everything that is
possible ta train skilled workmen for every

class of trade.
Commission recommended certain lines
along which the people of Canada should
be instructed. They recommended:
1. Hand training and prevocational cducation in the common schools aiter the age
of twelve to reveal 'the bent of the child's
ability ta itscll, ta its parents, and ta its
teacher.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-

2. Something in the -sehool classes ta
make boys and girls want ta continue at
school as long as they can.
13. Some provision in the way oi secondary industrial and technical education for
those who can continue at school from 12
ta 16.
4. 'Continuation classes Ia be attendcd
while young people are following some accupation ta earn their living.
5. Evening classes for workmcn and -workwomcn.

6. Middle technical schools ta which men
and women can came back for periods ai
from six months ta two years' after they
have been working for somes years.
This is for the purpose of carrying on the
ediction of childrcn after they have leit
the sehools, and enabling the work people
ta keep up their education, and lurther improve themscives, so as ta be in, a position
ta compete with the workmen ai other
cauntries. Thcy alsa, pointed out that in
making their examinatian as they had been
instructed to do by the 'Gavernment, they
found wherever they mot the various
bodies that they interviewed, that there
was a general feeling that .technical education bail not been carried far enough.
and that further efforts should be made in
that direction. There is one point about
this question that I should. like ta put before the leader of the Government. Inu this
country the inquiry an technical education
was undertaken by the Dcpartment of Labour, and the report of the commission was
made ta the De artment oi Labour, where
it has remained. In most other countries
this question of technical education is
taken up by the Department of Trade and
Commerce, and dcpartîments of that nature,
and it seems ta me that techuical educatian is much more s question for the Department ai Trade and Commerce than for
the Department of Labour in Canada. A
minister who is dealing with questions ai
commerce and the dcvelopment af trade
throughout the country would be brought
more immediately in touch with the industries interestcd in the -training af the
people on these technical lines, than a
minister who is dealing with the question
ai labour. Therefore I would suggest ta my
hon. friend that hi6 committee should make
lines
a recommendation along th-ese
when preparing their report. These a-re
same of the questions with. which this Gainmittee -shoiild deal, snd I think they could
be practically workcd along these lines.

APRIL 4. 1916

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN-1 should like 10
occupy the time of the House a f.w moments largely ini endorsing mueh that has
been said by the hon. leader of the Opposition, particularly in relation to the future
of Canada. Aller the war there will be
enormous changes. The mnt hopeful 'view
that can b. taken in liat il will be, a
period cf readjustment i which there will
be great disturbances, and that then we
will'settie dowax like the. rest of 1he world to
a new condition of affaire, with the prospect of a loÙg peace, and great development. Much stress* has been laid in this
honourable Hous. and elsewhere on the probabilities, and importance of immigration.
To me that does not seem quit. as important as the question cf effectiveness cf th.
work of th. people of Canada. I migit
illustraI. that by referring to the. history
of the last ten years of the census period,
of the province in whose representation i
this House I have the honour 10 form a
part. The increase of population ini Nova
SeMils between 1l00 and 1910 was trifling.
only nme seven per cent. Thiieures.. of
lhe products of our manufactures vas nmre
127 per cent. To put il othervise, the. value
i 4901 per head of its population vas

$51.50.

In 1911 thal per head >value had

risen to $106, or $107. In other yards, 1he
sarne population was producing in manufacturing articles momewhat more thaui
double what il had produced before. The
sarne thing is true cf lhe f arm. The value
of the farmes iu Nova 6cotia increaaed. lu
tiai sme period aome 60 per cent, aud the
value of larm producté nme 48 per cent,
sornething like $7.000,000. In other words,
Nova Scotia was vamtly richer per head of
population-though. tii. wealth was possibly
somewhat unequally divided-ast the. end
of th. tien years than et the beginning of
the decade. Whether we get a grea.
immigration from Europe, which I rallier
consider doubtful, or possibly from - the
United States, desirable though it wili
b. to utilize our transportation facilities
and other things vith which Ibis ountry is so lavishly provided, it is less
important than in-creasing 1he efficiency
cf oui produoers, a.nd less importa.nt
again than the proportion between 1he
people who are directly producing and creating wealth, aud thome who at beat are
occupying themmelves with subsidiary occupations. However, the point I especially
wish to endorse is the necessity cf preparalion for conditions after the war. Such ar-

rangements, la my view, should be undertaken very shortly bo prepare for what w.
may caîl the diplomatic relations between
thim country aud 1he Mother Country.
There is no question that those relations
wili be very much dloser aud more'importsut than they ever have been; and that
Canada will have ils ahare in layig down
the basis on which th. development, not
only of Canada, but of the Empire aud ils
Allies, will h. carried out for a terrn cf
yeara. Ritiherefore behooves the Goverument cf Canada, acting for its people, to
prepare as carefully end f ully as, possible
to0 train men 10 take up that department of
public service, who wili b. familiar witii
diplomatie business, familier with 1h. personnel if possible of the people who demi
with il on behaîf of the Mo'ther Country,
and cf the coher nations with whom w.
will be brought in contact, and so te speak,
speaking the language in which business cf
liai kind is carried on, and familier with
the precedents cf the. lime. If that is net
doue ve vill undertake 10 settle great
problerns and carry on business cf lie mcmt
vital importance by men who, while 1hey
are carrying on thal business sud establisiing these precedents, are only learîn
theur trade. The sarne thing is aise true cf
commerce. There is no question t.hat Cmiiadla will b. persona grata with thie Allies
in her efforts 10 obtain business lu Europeau counîries, .especially France, Belgium
and Russis, vidi, as the hon. leader cf
the Opposition remarked, vill be a fruitful
field for Canadien enterprise. Il is lierefore cf ireat importance that ve should
have men trained 10 deal with such questions, men enlightened as te the possibilities cf th. miaket. Il is net only necessary
that lie article we -arc m'anufacluring
should b. good aud suitable for the market,
but the way il is packed aud the form in
wiich il is put up are ail important. Il
would be well, therefore, in the interest of
Canada tiat the Government should decide
in good lime t0 have a competent staff of
men acting under whatever department is
thought best, naturally the Department of
Trade and Commerce, to rneet on equal
terme 1he clas o! men with whoma they
would have 10 demi. Il is penhaps perilous
ai tuis parlicular lime 10 speak of munitions. Il is a many-sided question, but
any on. who is at ail familier with lhe
question will admit liaI in the 16 mentis
or so cf 1h. war in whici we have bcen
eugaged, lhe manufacturers cjf Canada have

SENATE

shown ability to produce with great precision, and ingenuity in dealing with large
quantities, and large figures, and they have
received a training which they would not
have had in ten years of peaceful. production. For example, 1 arn told that the rejactions o~f munitions which. began with 18
and 20 per cent have sunk to 2, 3 and 4 per
cent ini a great many cases. That is a valuable asset which can be used to advantage
in times of peaos, and it will ba well for
the country if during the period of transition we have a staff of people competent to
make that ingenuity and resourcefuinesa
available in the production and distribution of things other than those for which we
have a sure ma.rket, the products of our
fields sand farina.
Hon. Mr. 3MNE-I should lika to say
a few words as a manufacturer. 1I think
this committee bas a great field for its
activity. It is ail very well to talc about
outside markets in trade and commerce.
This proposition means opening up the
markets for Canada. 1 have been in the
rnanufacturing business a long time, and
know something about the conditions whÉich
exist. One thing we have to consider is
that i Britain and other Enropean conntries the wages are very rnuch lower than
in Canada and the United States, and yen
have to consider this point, of 'which probably hon. gentlemen are not aware-although 1 k-now it-that the International
Union of America controls -the labour market of Canada, and bon. gentlemen know
that labour is a great item ini the expense
of manufacture. There are certaijl.limes of
manufactures probably, suoh as agricultural implements, that you could oeil te
Rusas, and other counitries, but the conditions there are not the saine. Labour is
so much cheaper in the Old Country than
it is in Canada that we cannot compete
with tbem. I would draw your attention te
the fact that United States bas a population
of over 100,000,000.
Here we have about
7,000,000. Supposing that we have 8,000,000
-and bion. gentlemen know we have flot tbat
--our borne market is small cempared with
that cf the United States. Tbey have their
100,000,000 and part cf Canada as well.
Many millions of manufactured goods that
we import frorn the United States could be
made in Canada provided we could get them
made.
But the United States manufacturers corne mbt this country, compete with
us, and drive us almost out cf our own
mnarket.
They can do that very well,
Hlon.

Mr. McLENNAN.

because in making the large amount of
goods whicb they manufacture, they can do
it more cheaply, and can keep the prices
right. If tbey can only geL enough money
froin Canada te keep the men and factories
going, tbey will prosper. A little while ago
there was a lot cf talk about using Canadian manufactured goods. I arn very sorry
te say that a great many people think goods
produced in the United States are better
than those produced in Canada; therefore
they buy mjàny articles produced in the
A great many farinera
United States.
coming in to our country from the United
States think the American article is better
than the Canadian, and give a little more
for it. In the West we cofnpete witb the
United States firma, and I arn sorry to say
we have sold goods almost at cost.
The
conditions in the West are pretty bard for
For instance,
us in our particular line.
from Chicago te Winnipeg the freigbt on a
steve weighing 400 lbs. is 50e per hundred
lbs. That is nearly $2. Frein my town we
psy nearly $1 per hundred, which brings
tbe fraight up te $4, giving them an advantage cf $2 over us. -We
know that the
rnoney which goes fromn Canada into the
United States neyer cornes back. We neyer
see it again. We are only adding te their
wealth and depleting our own. I think it
would ha well for the committee te study
tbat question.
The immigration question is going te be
a very serious -one. When this war cesses
the United States will not be m-aking as
rnuch money se tbey are deing to-day, and
Lhey will corne into our markets, as they
always do wben there is a depressi<rn in
their own, and will slaugbter their goods
in Canada. I know the facts and apart
frein the shell-making I do net think,
there is a manufacturer who is making any
money at ail. In the Iset two or three
years we bave net been making a cent.
It would net do to say tbhat, because people
weuld not believe you; but it is the war
that bas enabled manufacturera te make
serne rnoney eut cf producing war material.
I feel it my duty te say a few words te
yeu as a rnanufacturer knewing tbe conditions that exist, and tbe comrnittee must
consider tbe wbole question as te how we
are geing te protect our ow-n -facteries. We
will bave :to meet the 'competition of the
Americans wbo will be looking for markets
everywhere, and will be in a better position
thari ourselves 'because they specialize,
whereaa we have te make Lwe or three
i
things to try aud keep out end up.

APRIL 4, 1916

agree with the hon, gentleman who said
that wo ouglit te do everything we can for
the. fariner; but I say that this Governinent
is doing that now and ioading it on te the.
manufacturera. Take the war stamp. we
have te putL a etsmp on every letter, every

taxed on. cent. They have a littie protection on their apples, but thie manufacturera have te psy it aIl, and tiiey are the
fellowa that have te suifer ail the turne.
The, fset is thie, that when that committee
meets, I waut thoin. with the information
1 am. giving thein, te study this question,

and

try and even the thing up.

It

is ahl veli enough te talk about immigration, but we will net ge't immigration for
a long turne except grein the Un'Ited States,
viiich is net a good te us as the. European
immigration, 'because they bring nesriy
everythiing iuto Canada frem their ovn

SECOND REMADING.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the. second
reading of Bill (68), An Act rehating te the
Superior'Courts of Saskatchewan, sud te
arniend the. Judges Act.
He said: This Bill makes -provision for
the salaries of certain judges who must
necessarily be appointed under legisîstion
that has been passed by the province cf

Saskatchewan. It has iieen enacted by the
Saskatchewan Legislature that the Supreme
Court of Saskatchewan shall disappear and
that hereafter there shall b. twa courts,
viz., the Court of King's Bench and. the
Court of Appeal. This legislstion ,comes
into operation by proclamation ofthe
Lieutenant Governor in Council. In anticipation of that Order in Council eoming into
affect at whatsoever time ini the discretion cf
the Saskatchewan Government they may
prociajim it, it ie deairable te place upen our
statut. book the necessary provision for the
payment of the judges who wiii conatitute
thif Court of Appeal. Thia Bill accordingly
makes provision theref or.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I do not rise for the
purpose of opposing the second reading of
the Bill, but just te suggest that perhsps
the leader o! the House vas siightiy in
error when he said it became necessary for
this Parliament te provide for the salaries
of those judges as the local legisîsture had
provided for the, creation of the. judgeships.
1 do net think that atatement is quit.
accurate, because the. hon. gentleman probably feels in hie inmost heart that the local
Government will not bring their Act into
operation until vo make provision for the
psyment cf the, judges.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, that je true.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I have no doubt that
the hon. gentleman will be prepared te furnieh statistice viien we go into committee
to show that vo have at the present tirne
in the province cf Saskatchiewan a judicial
corps which je quit. large enougii te handle
sîl the. judicial business vhich is te b. done
in that province; and it seerns te me that at
a time hike this, viien those in authority
are trying te impreas upon ahl the people
of Canada the desirability cf being very
economical, we ehouid flot undertake te appoint unnecessary judges and pay sdditionsi salaries for work that is net realiy
necessary.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is scarcely'
necessary te peint eut, in snswer te whst
my hon. friend heom Halifax has said, that
unfortunately under our constitution we
have very little te say about the matt.r. As
my hon. friend knows, the British North
America Act makes provision for the. province te exercise their discretion as te the
judicisi machinery that they may consider
necessary, and the Governinent of Canada
18 called upon te make the neoessary finan-

SENATE

cial provision to give effeet te, their legisiatien. IL seems to me rather unfortunate
that the authority is divided in that way.
However, I suppose upn. -a final analysis
of the situation the provinces themselves
should be in a better position than the Féderal Government te determine what judicial
machin-erý' is necessary for their requirethe British North
However,

Arnerica Act so provides, and throws upon
this Government the necessity of making

i. what we are new doing.
Hon. Mr. 'POWER-We are ail likely to
take liberal Tiews I>f things when smrebody else pays the bill.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, 'that 15 true.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I do not rise to
oppose this Bill, because, as the leader cf
the Governrnt says, flhe Govuernment is
pretty -well foroed te bring this Bill before
Parliament; but in connection with this
matter, I should like te ask the leader cf
the Governmeift what has become of the
commission, or committee, 4that was appointed smre years ago for the purpose cf
consid1 eriîng the question cf the county
court judgesP
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-What was that?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I understood it was
a commission, or committee, te deai with
the question cf salaries of county court
judges ail through the Dominion cf Canada,
appointed smre time age, and I neyer
heard that any action was taken in regard
te tthe matter.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I do net recali
it.

Hon. -Mr. jBOSTOCK-It has alirsys
seemed te me t.hat with regard to county
court judges, especialiy in certain parts of
the country, the remuneration they receive
is net adequate te the duties they have te
perform. 1 quite understand that sorne
county court judges throughout the Dominion gel a salary that is a good deal
more, probabiy, than the work that they
have te d~o Is worth; but in certain cases
the ceunty court judges are very much underpaid, and it seemns a hardship and a difficulty te, get good men te perferm the duties
of county court judges. In the section of
the Judges' Act, section 33 cf chapter 138
says that.

saal, either directiy, or Indirectiy as directer
or mnanager of any corporation. company or
fIL= or In any other manner whatever, for hlmself or others engage In any occupation or business other than bis judicial Caties; but every
such Judge shafl devote himaeif exclusively te
*uch Judicial duties.

Tixerefore, we expect every man, wben
he is appointed a couty court judge, te
confine himseif to hit judicial dulies, and
I do net think the salary that ls paid at the
present lime is adequate in a large number
of cases.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Unfertunately,
owing ko uneontroflable conditions, uniformity of saiary bas le be adopted Iby the
Parliament of Canada in the payment cf
judges. JIf the aame discretion cou-id be
exercised in the payanent. of judges that
business corporations exercise with referenoe te, their employees we could pay judges
in accordance with the work lhey perforrn.
There are smre judges, at least Judges occupying judiciai positions in large centres,
who are overworked and inadequately paid,
who are -entitled te a very much larger- aiiowance thbm they receive; and there are
ather judges, ocdupying corresponding pôsitiens ini less busy districts, who receive
the same salary, and thus we might say
are overpaid. But I fancy that it weuld be
utterly impossible te put legielation through
Parliament leaving it diseretionary with
the Depattment cf Justice, or wilh the appeinting power, te pay judges in proportion
te the work which, they do. -As to t~he county
court judge3, of course, they are net paid
salaries as large as the Superior Court
judges; but if we are to judge cf the adequacy cf the salary by the nmber cf applications, or the number cf gentlemen who
are willing te accept vacancies that may
arise trom lime te lime, the Government
wouid be justified in assuming the position
laken by sorne that the salary is adequate
te the labours performed. There neyer has
been, I may say, within my knowledge a

very great dearth cf applications for vacancies that -arise from time te, lime. TheG<overnment has been able, by a <faix amount
of industry, te induce gentlemen to go upon
the bencli for the salaries which have been
aiready provided-I am now spcaking of
county court judges-but in aIl eeriousness
the pay of judges is net proportionate te
that cf other professions. There is ne doubt
that the great rnajority cf judges who accept
those positions would make very considerNo judge of the Supreme court of Canada abiy more at the bar; on the other hand,

there is this to be considered, that a very
liberal allowance is made by way of superannuation, and there is the assurance of
continued émolument during the lii e time
of the occupant of the office. Howevér, it
lias been a very controversial subject and
.one which lias been discussed from Confederation down ho the présent time, and it seents
to me that wé are no nearer a solution of
the difficulty as to the inadequacy of judges'
salaries to-day than weré those who preceded us 25 or 30 years ago. However, we

CUSTOMS TAiRIEF -ÂMENDMENT BILL.
BEWOND REIADING.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill No. 61,- An Act to axnend the
Customs Tariff, 1907.
He Daid: The object of this Bill is te
amend the Customs Tariff with respect ho
three items. One lias as its object an inicrease of 50 cents a barrel on apples. I
miglit say that representations have been
made, not only from British Columbia, Jbut
fromn the province of Ontario, as to the
desirability of inereasing the tariff upon
apples so as to promote the orchard industry and make it more profitable than it
has been.

Hon. Mr. Mo8W.EENEY-To eat apples.
Hon. Mir. LOUJGEED-Evidenoe 'that
lias been submitted to the <iovernmenthlas

established f airly conclusively that the
applé producers, both of Ontario and British Columnbia, have been produeing apples
at a loss. The evidence taken of the
cost of .producing ap.ples in the province of British Columbia, which. apples
corné inLo compétition in Canada with thosé,
produced in the Western States, particularly the Pacifie States, Oregon and Washington, establishes that the labours of the
British Columbia producér have been going
for nauglt, and that very serions losses
have thereby been sustained in that province. The increase of tariff nécéssary ho
stimulate the production of apples is comparatively small, and the Governmént lias,
therefore, felt justified in bringing down
to Parliamént an incréase to the extent indicated in the Bill now beforé us for our
consideration. There Is an item also increasing the duty upon fuel oil. Undér
what was known as the War Revenue Act
of 1915, a duty was placed upon oil of 5
per cent andér the preferéntial tariff and 7j
per cent undér the intermediate and general tariff. It is now proposed that a duty
shaîl be placed upon item 267, reading:
011.. petroleumi (flot- ncludlng crude petroleum lmported to be refIned or illuminating or
lubricating oils), '8236 specific gravlty or
heavier at 60 degrees témperaturé, per gallon.

SENATE

British preference tariff à cent, intermediate tariff j cent, general tariff j cent.
This oil, as crude ail and in addition the
residue of other crude or petroleum oil,
alter undergoing refining ls that covered
by the item. This oil, as well as the residue of certain other crude ail is used for
fuel purposes by railways, manufacturers,
and by transportation companies such as
steamship companies, etc. The other item,
267-a, really is a reduction in the tariff.
That applies to a claas of oul which entera
into use in traction englues and in that
clasa of motive power which. is se largely
nsed for agricultural purposes througliaut
the West. It is estimated that ta the agricultural community of the Northwest particularly it will effect a saving of about
$25,000. While the Government are, therefore, placing a very slightly increased tariff
upon the cruder fuel ails, those used by
large manufacturing companies, they are
reducing the tariff on that clasa of ail which
enteis into the consumption of the agriculturist. Under those circumatauces, as I
have already said, Parliament feels itself
justified, awing ta the representations that

the necessity of the moment for increasing
Our revenue to meet the increased expenditure due ta the war, ta introduce this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-My hon. friend has
referred ta this Bill as a means of increasing
the revenue of the country. With regard to
the first item mentioned in the Bill, the
increased duty an apples, I undeîstand it
is mainly for the purpose af assisting the
apple growers throughaut the Dominion,
and probably in Britishi Columbia more
especially, rather than for the purpose of
increasing the revenue.
Hon. Mi. WATSON-Hear, hear.

in îeally an econamical manner. The apple
industry, of the West, especially, has had
considerable experience ai liard tîmes, but
I do nat consider that this duty is gaing ta
relieve the apple grawer ta the extent that
my hon. friend prabably thinka. There are
other questions in cannectian with thse distribution af apples and the placing af them
in markets that will very materially affect
the wliole situation. Thse duty that the
Goverument proposes te put on apples, is
almost one miglit say, a prohibitive duty.
It will amount ta somethiug like 30 cents a
box, or 90 cents a barrel.
Hon. Mi. LOUGHEED-We are nat irepasing that amaunt oi duty; we are
increasing it ta that amount. The present
rate is 40 cents.
Hon. Mi. BOSTOCK-Before it was 40
cents a barre!; now it is 90 cents. It is an
increase af over 100 per cent. At the lest
election the promise was made in British
Columbia by the present Minister af Agriculture, that if succesaful in carrylie would aee

the

coming
into- British Columbia was placed at thse
same standard rate af duty as the rate on
apples gaing iuta the United States. Since
that time the duty on apples going ista
the United States lias been reduced rather
tlian increased, and therefore at tise pieseut moment we are increasing tise duties
on apples caming inta Canada, while the
people ai thse United States have loweîed
their duty. Iu the United States tariff
other reductions liave been made which are
very valuable ta this cauntry and have
materially helped oui industries, and we
are showing oui appreciation of those concessions by incîeasing very highly the duty
on apples caming inta Canada. It bas been
said tisat the American gîoweî has been in
the habit ai dumping apples into Canada
at prices considerably belaw their real market value. I bave a few figures showing
tlie prices at which apples bave been invoiced tram Ameian ports for the purpose af shipment ta 'Canada. In tlie year
1914-15 apples weîe invoiced at Winatcbee
at 55 cents a box; at Seattle an November
25, 1914, they were invaiced at 35 cents a
box.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-.My hon. friend has
referred ta the apple grower as not having
made any large amount af money af late
yeaîs. I admit that they have not been maling a fortune, but I do nlot know that the apple
garower has done very much worse than
people in ather businesses thîoughout the
country. The position, as I understand it,
is that apple growing and the placing of
apples on the market is an industry that

boxes of apples te a barrel. On the arne
day 27 boxes cf apples were invoiced. at
Seattle at 40 cents a box. Ninety-one boxes
at 51 cents a box; 7 boxes at 45 cents a
box. Then last year, on Nevember 16, 615
boxes of apples were invoiced at Seattle for
90 cents a box. Now the contention la made
that by putting on thii duty the grower
will receive a rernunerative price for bis
fruit, but the fact that the increase of diity
is not going te Taise the price to the consumner would show that -the change of thie
duty will flot very rnaterially help the
grower. WVe know that there has been a
great over-production of apples, and thorafore the grower need net expect ta get sny
better prices for his apples under this inicreased tariff. It rnay increase the coat te
the person buying apples ini Vancouver or
t the coast, because it will probably have
the effect of keeping Anierican apples out
of British Columbia. The question of transportation will very materially affect the
question of the price of apples in the Northwest. With regard te thc position of t.he
grower of apples in British -Columbia, lest
year they shipped frorn Okanagan district
30,000 boxes of apples for Australia; and
talking te a grower of apples the other day
from that part of the country he told
me that they had orders te ship 40,000 boxes
of apples to Australia this ccming season.
I do not sec how the duty on apples ccrning
into this country is going te help the grower
in getting a price for apples in Australia.
The same thing applies te South Af rica.
Last year they ahipped 11,000 boxes of
applef; te South Africa, and I understand
that that mnarket opened up very satisfacterily, so that the opportunity of increasing
the business between this country and
South Afrîca witlî apples, provided they can
get proper transportation, is very hopeful.
I do net, therefore, appreciate the objecL of
the Government at this time in increasing
the duty on apples coming into this country,
whic'h, of course, is a pelicy that is open
te a considerable amount of discussion.
With regard te the duty on cil my hon.
friend te !y right (Hon. Mr. Edwards) and
I, co-operating with gentlemen interested
in the Forestry Association, have urged
upon the railway conmpanies the necessity
of taking precautiens te prevent forest
fires. TZe Railway Commission and other
bodies connected with the Government have
*also aided, wvith the resuit that the railways
have altered theif locomotives so as te use
oil as a fuel te a very large extent on their
lines.
Having gone te the expense and
S-8i

trouble cf making their locomotives oiuburning engines, and providing other appliances for the using cf cil instead cf coal,
the Government now cornes down and imposes an increased duty on cil. iSome Urne
agô a petition was presented te the premier
ef British Columbia by a large number cf
firms in that province, opposing the agitation which was then being carried on to have
a duty placed. on crude cil impcrted into
Canada. lIn that petition they pointed out
that the use of crude cil in.-the place cf coal
had enabled manufacturera in British
Columbia te develop their industries te an
extent whieh would have been impossible
had they been cornpelled to continue te
use ceai. 1 understand that that pet4 tien
was forwarded te the Governrent here, and
they know the large number of firms
interested in this matter, and understand
their anxiety that no duty should bo placed
on cils used for fuel purposes. These manufacturera will, cf course, be perfectly ready
te pay a duty if it is required te increase
the revenue cf Uic country, and provide
money for the purpose of carrying on this
war. but otherwise I think they are justified
ini feeling that they have net benu very f airly
used in having a duty placed on oil in ibis
way after ihey have been, in certain instances, as* in thc case cf transportation
companies, almost forced te adopt oi] as
a fuel, ini order thai the foresis cf ib.is
country might net be endangered.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I desire te say a word
with reference te this change in the tariff.
il strikes me se very strange that the fruit
growers cf this country ean get the ear o-f
the Government and have changes made
i the tariff te suit themeelves, while the
wheat, growers in the ig provinces cf the
West, who produce dollars where the spple
growers produce cents, cannot get a hearing. My hon. friends are aware that the
wheat growers cf the West have been after
the Government for several years endeavourîng te have the duty taken off
wheat. They demand a free market; they
do net want protection, but the Government
will net liaten to them, notwithstanding the
fact that they are producing the wealth
cf the coutnry. The Government may obtain a little revenue out cf this duty, but
it ie rnerely a drop in the bucket.
With

That illustrates one cf the difficulties wi.tl
which we are faced cf securing immigration cf a desirable character ta settle and
colonize aur lands. There is another very
important question that this comni*tte will
have ta take into consideration,. and that
is the question cf immigration. Without
immiglation we cannot settie aur lands.
The question ai immigration and colonization are se interlocked that there la no
use of discussing one withaut the other.
We have advocated frein time ta time the
promotion cf immigration froni the British
Isles, s0 that we might thus secure a
class cf settlers -more desirable than it
wae thought we could. abtain ironi any
J will flot say the Donmather country.
inion cf Canada has exhausted immigration froni the iBrîtish Isles, but I
might say that the agriculturist ironi the
British Isles is scarcely available any langer
as an immigrant. I understand froni very
goed authority that to-day there are not
mare than 300,000 families in the United
Kingdem engaged in agriculture-a number
which is entirely inadequate for meeting
the requirements of the United Kingdom,
aund from which in the future we cannot
expect ta draw our immigration-There ia
the question ta be considered by Canada
frem what channels we shail draw eur immigration. There are many ecenomic considerations that miust enter into a proper
dealing with this particular subject. We
have no desire ta make this an alien country, and yet at the sanie time we have ta
go into alien countries for the purpose of
procuring immigrants to settle aur many
milliens of acres of land throughout the
length and breadth ai Canada, and more
particularly in the Prairie Provinces. The
question arises as ta aur being able ta assimîlate ta aur civilization and to aur palitical conditions those aliens whom we must
bring into Canada if we are to settie up this
Dominion. Those are economic problems
that are difficuit ta solve, that cannot be
solved superficially, that must or shauld be
dealt with by thase who have given the best
part of their lives ta the study ai those very
impertant questions. That is a prablein
that should receive the very best consideratian and theught at the hands af this canimittee. I was particularly struck, when my
lion. friend frani De Balarberry introduced
this motion, by the dîfficulty which miust

in dealing with these questions on account
of the conflicting views which are voiced
by different persons. My hon. friend froni
De Salaberry grew quite e'ptimistic as to what
the future af Canada must necessarily be
immediately after the war. In fact, it was
one of the firat occasions on which I saw my
hon. friend from De Salaberry become
thorojughly enthusiastie in his prognostications of the presperity to follow the cessation of war and the declâration of peace;
and I must say, as one having aome interests in the West, that at once 1 grew quite
hopeful, and advanced the values of my
variaus interests as I listened to him. But

second the motion, and pointed out the
dire disasters that must necessarily follow
the development ai Canada immedîately
-after the war, I must say that xny spirits
rand my hopes and optimism disappeareden
tirely. That is one of the difficulties that
we are called upon to face. Hon. gentlemen
occupying very important positions in the
commaercial. and financial world view this
subject from entirely different standpoints.
One urges upon the Government the necessity of preparedness te meet an unprecedented wave of prosperity; and then some
other gentleman of equal standing, on whose
judgment we would rely quite as much
out
points
of the other,
as that
that there is no necessity for taking
any steps; that the only preparedness we
will have to make will be to meet disaster.
Consequently, we are up against this peculiar difficulty, and 1 certainly cannot f ail
ta feel some curiosity as ta the prophetic

predictions upon
phase, and as to what the .finding af the
eommittee will be. There is another view
of the situation which one should not overlook, and that is the unprecedented prosperity of our neighbour the United States,
whose economoic, climatic, racial and social
conditions, are practically the sanie as aur
own, and whose prosperity during the last
century has no parallel in history. When
one consîders that a century ago the population of the United States was appraximately the saine as that of Canada to-day,
while Europe, froni which it drew its population, would not represent one-third of the
population of the Europe of to-day; that

in the world. In the past they have been
prepared for southern countries like iltaly,
Spain and South America. Owing to the
number of trawlers that have been taken
from the Scotch and Irish figheries, and
from the coast of Engiand, a demand is
now springing up for our fish. As hon.
gentlemen are aware, in the pasi nearly
ail the flsh consumed in the British Isies
würe used fresh, bein.- taken from the trawlers almost the day on which they were
caught; but at the present time nothing
hias 'been done, and nothing can be done to
put our fish, on the British market until
transportation facilities can be secured. In
the past, for instance, our lobsters--of
whieh there are about $l,000,000 worth
caught ini Prince Edward 'Island waterswere shipped mostly to France, Norway -ad
Sweden, a gerat many of them going
through Great Britain. Before the var
those were taken at about 27 cents a case
from Prince Edward Island right .through
to Nancy, Havre and other ports in France.
Last year the freight went up to 106 shillings.a ton, or four times as much as it was
before. 1 have muade inquiries of the shippers and they tell me that this year they
cannot get freight less than $3.50 a case,
and can get no guarantee of delivery ini any
particular month of the year. As hon, gentlemen are avare, the contracte are made
about this season and deliveries are made
from month to month. At the present time
no guarantee wiii be given at any price to
deliver freight at any particular time, as
the owners of the ships dlaim that they do
not know what day their ships may be
commandeered by the British Government.
I tbink it would ibe au excellent thing if
our Government would appoint a mnan who
would be in touch with the British Government to arrange these matters as f ar as
possible. This applies not only to lobsters,
of which $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 worth go
from the Maritime Provinces; but it will
also affect the shipping of cheese, butter
and other things that go from the Maritime
Provinces to the other side of the Atlantic.
While merchants are seeking means of
transport, the Government at the same time
having such an agent might help to relieve
matters. It wo'uld be of very great assistance in putting shippers in communication
with àteamship companies that would be
in a position to take our freight acroas, because no arrangements can be made,
and no
sales
can
be made
until
the freights have been arranged. 1 mvss

Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Many years tago I
took considerable interest in a committee
soniewhat 6imilar to the one proposed in
this resolution, and I thînk great good vas
the result of its work, especially to the
agricultural cîsas of the 'country.
It was
confined to much narrower limits than this
reeolution, because I ee that the proposal
is that tihis committee ýshould inquire alone
or jointly wîth a like comrnittee o! the
Housue cf Commons, into what is .being done
and what could be doue to Ibest prornote the
agricultural, industrial and trade interests
of 'thi6 country bhoth during and eafter the
war.
A few of the question that present theinselves to my mind in connection with this
proposed inquiry are these: at this lat"!
stage o! the session, what can that coinmittee do? It muet be authorized to continue its operations a! ter the close of the
session o! Parliament; otherwise it can d,
very little. It would add to the importance
and value of the committee if At were made

and used Lb. land for growing beet root.
Wbat waz the result? I visitecý there rnany
years ago, and the land whieh 1 could have
purchaaed for $8 or 89 an acre years ago
was aelling for 880 or $90. Why had it increaued in value? Because mcen went int

large quantities, and the industry la going

of the atate on account of that being done
which had remained undone 'for ail Ume
before ini thaL country. No¶>ody'a attention
had been d.irected to It. And so it ia with
the posaibilitie. of varions parla of our
-ountry. I aaid that tbis commission should
b. itinerant in its nature, 'because, while
they may know the conditions within two

is bard te say what the possibilities are

are the limes on whiob action would do good,
but te aecompliah what rnight be accomplished, by this commission would require
a great deal longer lime, and a larger number of people engaged in il than Ibis resolution contemplates. I arn far frorn believing Ihat there would not Ïbe, a great deal

thought when the discussion was going on
with regard to the Bill to amend the customs tariff, how short-sighted we sometimes
are. One gentleman said, " You are prepared te do a great deal for the apple growers and nothing for the wheat growerR."
The wheat grower bas a good profit on
the cultivation of hie 'land. A gentleman
came down on the train with me and he
said: " Last year I grew wheat, and
after I had grown, threshed and marketed
it, when I counted up my profits, paid al]
expenses and everything, I juet made ex-.
actly $31 an acre on the land I cultivated
in one year. Will any one tell me that is
flot a very good profit. It ie true it was an
exceptional year, but the farmer who was
raising that large quantity of grain and
getting euceh a return, did flot require the
same assistance and protection as the fruit
grower who was getting a very smaîl return. I know a little about it, because
fruit is very plentiful in our part of the
country. I only refer to it Wodraw atten,.
Lion to the fact that we must not be so selfish. as te direct our thought exclusively te
the lime in which we make our money, but
should have regard for othere. There must
be give and take, or we neyer can attain
te the national statue to which we could
rise if we were generous te others and flot
quite so selfish as we sometimes are. We
took up tobacco growing in western Ontario. Every one in Essex county and
neighbourhood knovs te what proportion
that îndustry has grown and the valuable
return it yields. We started the sugar beet
industry. That is goîng on and doing well.
It je handicapped in many parte of the
country for want of labour. That ie the
drawback you have to contend with, because the climate of our country is calculated to grow beets with as large a percentage o! sugar in them as anywhere,
and we are not growing them to the extent we might, simply because we have not
the labour. But we miglit have our attention
directed to some other lines, where return
might be made without so much labour.
That can be done in cattle raising. The more
attention you can direct to these limes, and
the more you can get the people to know
about them, and the more you can make
peoiple think, analyse and inquire, the
better will be the result, no matter what
lime it may be. I have one word to say
with regard to immigration, because that
was mentioned. One of our friende from the
West said that the great requiremient in the
West le to 6ettle up that Country. Lest year
Hon. Mr. SPROULE.

we had only a âmail percentage of the
country under cultivation, but there ie a
great deal of waste land in that part of
Canada. Regarding immigration, years
ago the whole craze of Parliament was
to get the people there in large numbers.
I have said in Parliament over and over
again that ini my judgment it should not
be our ambition to get immigrants in large
numbers regardiese of the countries from
which they corne, but should consider their
value to the country when we get them
here. We have brought in thousande . of
people who have been a detriment to
the country.
We would have been
much better off if that land had
remained unsettled for 50 or 200 years
rather than fill up the country 'with
people, many of whom are breaking down
our high civilization instead of raising it.
That does not apply to ail classes of imnmigration, because a great many of the immigrante will make good settiers and be valuable to the country.
If the question of
immigration were taken up again, and I
were permitted to give any advice, I would
say that we should be more careful as to
the clasa of people we bring ini, rather than
look for large numbers. If we have millions of acres of arable land out there not
settýled, I do not se that we are any the
poorer. We have a place for good settiers
and our own population to go. It is largely
from the overflow population of Ontario that
Manitoba has been settled.
A time will
corne in the future, after the war is over,
when we will find another population growing up, and we will have a place where
England, Sootland and Ireland can send
their surplus population. We will not feel
badly off if we ha:ve land where they can
settie, but if we get citizens from every
country of the world, whether they are good
or bad, the resuit may flot be so satisfactory, because a great population does not
necessarily make the best settiement. Take
the case of Belgium. The average farm in
Belgium le from one to four acres. There le
no great wealth there, but they are living
in moderate comfort. They have divided
the land mnto emaîl holdings, and the -people
are better off than the people in many other
countries where the holdings are ten times
as large. It is true that when you grow
great cities they draw a large population,
but you get a large number of people you
have te support by charity. You have to
organize your societies and give your
money, and you have a great deal of
poverty on your hande.
I think if the
people were distributing their products as

thought and consideration, you would not
have as large a percentage of people 10 be
maintained at the expense af others durmng
the winter time in our cities as you have
aI the present. Those are things that
should engage aur attention, but in my
judgment the committee, if appointed.
would, do a great deal of good, though not
as -mucli good es it could accomplish. I
would suggest thet the comnmittee bave
pa.wer .10 sit during recess and travel over
the country as well; o'Lherwise il will not

Hon. Mr. BEIQUJE-I arn gratified and

çontributions.to the subject before us, and
gratified also thal 'the hon. leader of 'the
House lias accepted the suggestion. I was
afraid he miglit thînk the abject was te
interfere iNitb the valuable 'woxk with which
the Ecanomic Commission bas been entruated. He has underatood the true objeo
of the imotion. It is to lielp disobarge a
part <>f thet 'work, and that la the roseu
why I suggested iu thie motion that the
lhou, gentleman sliould alec be a member
af this oon>mittee, in order that the work
mnay be co-ordinated, and that one committee xnay ual 'work against the other or
cover the same ground. and that is the
reason 1 deemed il adivisaible ta suggest
that the hon. gentleman from Middleton be
aiea a mexnber of the committee, so that
there would be two menibers of the commission wlio wouid aiea be membera of the
coxmnittee. I quite approciate the remarks
which hiave been made iby the hon. gentleman from Grey. I realized that il would

thal il would be a;ugg-ested that il could

a suggestion as soon as the committee is
formed, wbich *may remove the apprehensions entertained by the laon, gentleman
and other inembers af the House. As was
properly stated iby the hon. leader of this
House, aur people are looking toa much
ta lhe Governmenl to t.ake the initiative
and doa everytbing. It is of the utmost
importance that the people should be made
to think for themselves, and ta help ta
build u<p this nation, if we are ta see, as
I- amn sure we will, a great nation in this

land. TIhat is the main object of -my
motion. My desire and abjet is ta sel the
community at large seriously considering
the pra.blemfs referred ta in the motion, and
lielp solving tflem. As moon as the committee is fo.rmed, I think that a well prepared
circular ahould be issued ta ail the
municipal bodies, rural and urban, inviting
them ta study the question as far as they
may be concerned. *For example, I would
suggesl that these municipal bodies sliauld
be inviled ta see wliat can be done towards
(a) increasing agricultural production; (b)
improving methode of production, and assisting luis method by proper instruction
and demonstratian; (c) attracllng immigralion; (d) establishing employmenl bureaus;
(e) establisliing manual and leclinical training echools; (f) facililating post school instruction until lhe eildren have attained
the age of 18; (g) promoting- local industries.
Those are questions which can h. studied
by municipal bodies. I quite realize that
some of them may not give mucli attention
ta the malter, but I hope liaI -a
great number of them will give proseveral
of
these
per attention
la
questions, and that it will he the
meane of making them. underetand liaI we
are paseing tlirough an extraordinary period
when everybody should contribute bis aliare
af work and lry ho lielp lie community aI

nol only ta thie municipal bodies, but ta al
chambera cf commerce, ta ail transportation campanies, ta ail manufacturera' associations, ta the ahipping association, ta ail
seboal boards, ta ail coileges and universiahl organîzed
a word
ta
ties, in
bodies in the co'untry, and invite tbem
ta caver the part of lhe wor'k ar study
which mnay fail within Iheir province.
It seemas ta mne that by a procedure
af liat kind the commîltee may be
able ta abtain valuable information and
experts who may h. employed by the coinmittee, may do a great deal for the country. -As the hon. leader of the Government
in this Hause stated very properly, the
people are very muci dependent upon lbe
Government. 1 cannaI find a better example of that than in the item 'which I
have under my banda. Il dates back ta

things in whîch they are ilterested, and
the Government and the country are entitled to have froni those associations all
the help which they can give. These associations, instead of apprçachîng in a proper
spirit several of the questions which had
been confided to the commission, immediaiely made up their minds te corne to
Ottawa and te make the followîng suggestions:

lion, gentlemen will see that these fartiers' associations, instead of coming with
seme suggestions in concrete ferin, invited
the commrission te do the werk which they
thernselves should have done. My object
is 'te tur the table on these associations,
and insist upen their doing their share oi
the work. They are best qualified te do
it, and should be made te do it at the earliest possible moment, and I have ne doubt
will do it when asked. Now you have the

The hon. leader of the Government misunderstood my opening remarks if he understood me to say that at the end of the
war I expected this country would have to
take care of an unprecedented prosperity.
I neyer thought anythixig of the kind.
What I did think and say was this: that
at the end of the war this country would
meet with either prosperity or the greatest
depression in iii history, according as they
would prepare or fail te prepare for if, and
iny object is to set the country at work in
order that the necessary vreparation should
be undertaken as soon as possible, in

great difficulties ini oui way, but the events
through which we have passed, and through

eonsumption of capital that has taken
place, and fully realize the staggering accumulation o! debta which ha taking

and thiat was the object of Germany in impesing thre five billio>ns ef indemnity. They
thought France wo'uld trot be able to pay
such a large sum of mo-ney; that it would

I hope that this example given by the
Canadian Pacifie railway will be followed
by other transportation companies. and also
by the provincial governments, and iby the
Dominion Government itself. It -is recognized that a good immigrant is worth some

these and a great many other means can

These are the few xemarks which I intended to make in winding up the debate en

there is work for them -to do, and in such
cases are credited with 26 cents per day's
work. Besides they are fed and clothed.
2. Prisoners of war are treated in accordance with the miles laid down by the Hague
Convention.

the Canadian Government periodically by
the Government of Great Britain.

on a subject which Il am sure the lawyers

pcrhaps I should not attempt to say anything, but we have been appointed legislators for lite, and surely if every one of
us in this Chamber has been thought

of muitors'winning unanimously in the first

oppoffent, -"Very wcll, we will go to thc
Privy Council," and the ouitor, not having
the means to go to the -Privy Council, had
to accept a compromise. The Act creating
the Supreme Court of Canada was called
at first " An Act to create a Supreme Court
and Exchequer Court " ail in one. This
was donc in 1875, 41 years ago. Long ago
as that may appear, I was then in Ottawa.
During the time of thc Mackenzie Government, I was one of the French transiators
in the House of Commons, and by a coincidence my father wvas chairman of the
Commîttee of the Whole, when this Bill
wvas being passed. There were no Deputy
Speakers at that time. I was just 18 years
of age, the time when oùle's mind is most
receptive, and I remember full wvell that
the intention of creating that court of appeal was te restriot appeals to the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. I do not
know if -the hon, senior member for Halifax was in the Hosise at that time. Ne
came here very shortly afterwards, if I reniember. So I knew the principal people
connected with that legislation, and heard

them explain its objeet. It was, if possible, to let the people of this country interpret their own laws.
Article 101 ot the British North America
Act provided that a Court of General Appeal for Canada should be established. At
that time no objection was taken to the creation of this court, not even from the province -of Québec, -from which objections came
later. Session -after session of the Parliament of Canada the speeches from the
Throne almoist invariably foreshadowed
legisiation to establish a Court of Appeals
for the whole of Canada. Nothing was
donc, however, until 1873, when the late
Sir John A. 'Macdonald actually drafted a
Bill creating s Supreme Court; but, as we
ail know, in 1873 the Pacific Scandai arose
on charges made by the Hon. Lucius Seth
Huntingdon, and the revelations of one
McMullen, and in the turmoil that resulted
the Bull was nlot proceeded with. I do flot
want to mix any politics in this, but the
position in Parliament at that time was
something like the sensation produced by
recent revelations, and a Committee of Inquiry was appointed. The House met again
in August, only 4to be prorogued immediately by the late Governor General, then
Lord Dufferin. There was a protest and 1
remember the late Hon. Joseph Cauchon
wanted to proceed, notwithstanding the
prorogation. There was quite a turmoil;
howcver, the Parliament stood prorogued
until November, and when Parliament met
in N'ovember the Administration of Sur
John A. Macdonald resigned. Hon. Alexander Mackenzie was called upon to f orm
a Government. The elections were held in
February, -1874, and his Government was
returned by a very large majorîty, in tact
from Ontario the Opposition was nlot very
much more numerous then than it was
atter the election of 1911. That session only
routine business was done. It was not until
the session of 1875 that the Bill to create
a Supreme Court was introduced. The then
Minister of Justice was the Hon. Telesphore Fournier. He had succeeded the late
Sir Antoine Dorion, who had been Minister
of Justice in the Mackenzie Administration for only a few months. When introducing the measure, the late Mr. Fournier
said, in a short speech, that he hadl used
a great deal of the draft Bill that had
already been prepared by the late Sir John
A. Macdonald, and that it was not a party
question. Sir John A. Macdonald, as leader
of the Opposition, commended the MinisEDITION

,SENATE

ter of Justice for the introduction of this
measure and said that he was very gled
that some of the labour he had put on
this Bill was coming into effect, and
that every member of the House should try
to make the measure as perfect as possible.
Everything went on harmoniously. When
the discussion -began on the second reading
of the Bill, objections arose, I must say
mostly from the province of Quebec. Objections corne often from that province.
The member for IMontmagny, Mr. Taschereau, who was afterwards Chief Justice of
the Court o.! Appeal in the province o! Quebec, now Sir Henry Taschereau, took strong
exception to the measure, saying that cases
of civil rights, tenure of land servitude and
so on should not be placed under the jurisdiction of this Court of Appeal. R may
say that the Hon. Mr. Mills, whom many
in this House knew very well as leader o!
the Senate for the Government when I entered this House in 1900, took exception to
the measure from a constitutional point of
view, and several other gentlemen spoke
against giving this court jurisdiction over
matters arising under local laws. However, -the Minister of Justice thought that
at noa distant date no appeal would lie
from the Courts of Canada to the Judicial
Committee o! the Privy Council. The title
of the Act was, "The Supreme and Ex.
chequer Court Act," and it was assented
to on the 8th April, 1875. The article'to
which I referred in the British North Amnarica Act, article loi, is:
The Pariament of Canada xnay, notwithstanding anything In this Act, from time to
time. xprovide for the constitution, maintenanoe. and organisation of a Generai Court or
Âppeal for Canada, and for the establishment
ot any addItionai court for the better administration of the laws of Canada.
This wording gave to the able lawyers who
were then in Parliament no end of ground
for argument. It was held by many that
"for the better administration of the laws
o! Canada" meant the laws of Canada
only, federal statutes. Othere with equal
force, among them the Minister
o!
Justice at the time, argued that the
words -notwithstanding anything in this
Act" overrode everything else, and that
this Court of Appeal should be competent
to hear cases from all the provinces. The
Minister o! Justice said that while there
were very strong reasons for maintaining
the appeal to the Privy Council, there were
stronger reasons for doing away with it.
Now I wish hon. gentlemýen te bear in
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

mind that this appeal to the Judicial Coinmittee o! the Privy Council has nothingwhatever to do with the inherent and absolute right of any British subject to lay his
complaint. hîs grievance or bis petition at
the foot of the Throne. They are two things
absolutely distinct, and man:y who maintafin
that this appeal te England should not be
abolished draw a red herring across the
trail when they aay, "You are denying to
British sujects the right of appeal to the
Mc'ther ~land," a.nd Bo on. That has nothing
te du with the question. The appeal to the
foot of the Throne is another thing altogether. There was only one King of England
who ever sat on the Bench as a judge, and
then the judges who were near hian as accessory told him not to speak, 'because I
suppose he was not very well viersed ini the
law. Now, the Judical Committee of the
Privy Council is a cornmittee of the Hanse
o! îLords. We know that the House of
Lords is still the very highest Court
of Appeal, and it is the House of Lords
that la the court cf last resort in England.
With that conservatism that characterizes
Bri-tish institutions they still. contend that
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
is the Ho'use cf Lords itself, but as a

only three law lords who sit on a case
like that. In cases cf great importance

Cartier in the House, succeeded the Hion.

APRIL 6, 1916

rhe Hon. Mr. Lafiamme was of the opinion
that our own people were much better qualified to administer justice te the people of
this country than a commîttee of the Privy
Council. He held that the lords of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
had not only to know French law, but had
teo know Spanish, Duteh, and Hindoe law,
so that they could not be as weIl qualified
as our own people who were simply versed
in the laws of Canada. But there was another objection. based on the sentiment of
loyalty. We were told that if we did not
allow appeals te England, the tie with the
.Mother Country would be weakened. Well,
it is a queer thing that the tie which binda
us te the Mother Country should be a question of rnoney. In Ontario you have lîmited the right ef appeal to the Privy Council to cases involving $4;000. That is te
say, if the case does net involve more than
$4.000 you cannot go to the Privy Council.
In tha province et Quebec for many years
the amount was limited to $2,000. Now,
why should a man lu Quéec be threatened
by a wealthy corporation or a rich man
with an appeal te the Privy Council if the
amount is just ovet $2,000, when the came
corporation or rich man could not take a
similar case fromn Ontario te the Privy Ceuncil unless the amount invQlved exceeds
$4,000. The limit lias reoe-ntly beau raised
te $5,000, but I ask hbon. gentlemen how At
happens that auch an injustice was allowed to go on from year to year for I do
noV know how 'long. If I receive a satisfactory explanatien of that I shall be content.
I nnderstand perfectly that lu order te make
our Supreme Ceurt a court et last resort,
the consent o! the provinces would have te
be obtained. 0f course a suitor lu a provincial court is noV obliged te go te the
Supreme Court, but can appeal directhy
from the provincial court of appeal to the
Privy Council; but if the Supreme Court
were made a court of lasV resort iVwould be
up to the provinces to accept the jurisdiction of that court as final. I amrnmerely a
la.nd surveyer s.nd have no opinion on the
subject. I amn merely giving the opinion oi
éminent lawyere whe bave hooked into the
question when I say that the provinces
would have te consent before the~ right o!
appa to the Judical Committee o! the
Privy Council couhd be toucbed. I said
just now that the inaliénable riglit ef
comany British subject te lay his
plaint at the foot et the Throne, is ene
which can net be affected by abolishS-194

ing the right of appeal to the Judicial Cernmittee of the Privy Council. An example
might illustrate that. The right of appeal
to the foot of the Throne, bas been very
seldom exercised. 1 do not know any members of this House that has exercised it. I
once myseif used that privilege as a British subject. It was a case in which bondholders %vere interested. They were of the
opinion that they had a case against the
Government of the province of Quebec. The
Hon. S. N. Parent was Prime Minister of
Quebec at the time. The Hon. Mr. Duffy
was Treasurer of the province of Quebec,
a,nd the Hon. HTorace Archamrbault Attorney General. 1 happened to know those
gentlemen very well. 1 saw them repeatedly about getting what we might eall a
petition of right, because as hon. gentlemen
ail know, we have to obtain permission
fromn the Government before we can sue
them. The people who were interested
were strangers in this country. Their attorney, who was no other than the present
Postmaster General, the Hon. T. Chase
Casgrain, thought they had a case. He
had made application for a petition of right
and could not get it. The matter dragged
on for menthe and months-for nearly one
year. It seemed to me that these people
had a right to piead in our own courts
against the Government, snd that the Goverriment should not deny them. that right.
The Government persisted in their refusai. Believing that there could be no
wrong without a redress somewhere, I comnmunicated wîth the then Lieutenant Governor et the province of Québec, 6ir Louis
Jette. I met the Governor and said to him,
'«I understand it is the inalienable right
of a British subjeet to lay bis petition at
the foot of the Throne. I do not ask you
for a reply, but 1 ask you to listen to me,
te hear my petition, to hear my prayer, and
after you'have heard it, it will be your
duty, as a representative of the Sovereign,
to act." He did. Forty-eight hours aiterwards the petition et right was granted.
rhat is the privilege of any British subject. Hon. gentlemen will sc that there
is no analogy between that and an -appeal
te the Judicial Committee ef the Privy
Council. To say, therefore, that making
the judgment o! our eupreme Court final
we'uld tend te weaken the tie between this
country a.nd the Mother land le absolutely

could considerably restrict appeals. Dur-

at ail froma New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia. 0f co urse the courts of the provinces might restrict appeals in a very
simple way, by raising the amount required
to go to the Privy Council. 1 said just now
in Ontario At is $4,000. That is littie
enougli. I can prove by a letter I have
here from a very eminent lawyer that the
necessary expenses of an appeal amount to
a great deal more than that. If the amount
were raised to a higher limit the provinces
could in that way protect their own people.
As far as Quebec is concerned, why the
limit lias been left at $2,000 is altogether
beyond my comprehiension. Now in order
to, show the intention of those who passed
this Supreme Court Act, I quote the following fromn the motion of the Hon. Rodolphe
Laflamme, which wis carried:
As the Supreme Court of Canada was intended to serve au a substitute

I have already asked why the limit was
flot made the saine as in Ontario. I do not
know why.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Two thousand dollars
forty years ago was a lot of money.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-If we take the difference in the value of money then 'and
now, sýrely it would be up to the provinces
to raise the amount Uow, and make it somewhat in keeping with the fees that litigants
have to pay. Objections to the court were
taken, and very strong objections, by the
Hon. David ills, and Mr. Taschereau.
The Hon. David Milis went so far as to say
that if local laws were to corne under the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, we no0
longer had in this country a federation but
actually a legislatîve union. H1e spoke very
strongly, and niany other debaters on that
question spoke of the Supreme Court of the
United States and some of them instanced
the difference. Ail of us who are familiar

reverse here. In Canada the central government is .supreme, except as to, defined

United States and ;vhat lias taken place
here. Another very strong objection also

H1e thought they should flot have the opportunity of keeping people in a state of uncertainty. as a sort of blackmail over a

not only well.known in Canada, but he hias
a reputation as a jurist even outside the
boundaries of lis own country. That is
evidenced by the fact that lie was selected,
just before the war in Mexico, as a jurist
Di repute to define the international boundary between the United States and Mexico,
and this work had just started when the
disturbed state o! Mexico interfered with
the operations o! the commission. I refer to Eugene Lafleur, K.C. I have here
a letter addressed by him to J. E. Martin,
K.C., which reads as follows:
Montreal,

14. 1914.

1. E. Martin, Esq., K.C.,

Montreal.
My dear Batopnier:
I duly received your letter of the 26th March
requestlng rny views upon the following questions:

Court of Canada be altered:
the vadidity of any Acts of

the legisiature of the province;
(b) as regards municipal by-laws or other
proceedings and as regards civil and
commercial matters other than that anising froma a federal statute?
2. Should the amount in dispute to permit
the appeal be increased, and, if so, to what

leave, and from $4,000 to $5,000 for the hearing
on the menits. In a case from the province of
Quebec there may already have been an appeal
to the Court of Review, another to the Court of
Appeal, and atil another to the Suprerne Court,
before special leave bas been applied for.
Per these reasons 1 arn disposed to think that
the time has proba.bly corne when a limitation
of the prerogative right shouid be seniously
considered. Wbether we should go In this
direction so far as Australie, has gone la a
matter for discussion, but 1 feel very strongir
that the authorlty and usefulnesa of our own
Supreme Court would be enormously enhanced
If It were In reaiity what It was Intended ta
becoore-a final Court of Appeai for Canada.
Yours truly,
E. Lafieur,
(Slgned)

This is the opinion ot *Mr. Eugene Lafleur, and I arn sure that those who knew
hlm will admit that though as an authority
hie mey have corne equals, he certainly has
no superior in thîs country. Perhaps I1 may
tel! you now what Australia bas done:
The right te appeal from the High Court of
the Commonwealth of Australla (correspondIng
to our Supreme Court of Canada) la regulated

by section 74 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act 63 and 64 Vic., (Imp.) cap. 12, which
lu au follows:
74. No appeal shall.be permitted to the Queen
in Council from a decision -cf the High Court
upon any question. however arising. as to the
limita Inter se of the constitutional powers of
the Commonwealth and these of any State or
States, or as te the limita Inter se of the
censtitutional powers of any two or mnore
States, unieus the High Court shall certify that
the question lg one which ought te be deterrnined by Her Majesty in Council.
The High Court may no certify If satisfled
that for any speciàl reasen the certificats should
be granted, and thereupon an appeal shall lie
to Her Majesty In Council on the question
without further leave.
Except as provided In this section, this constitution shail net Impair any right whlch the
Queen rnay be pleased to exercise by virtue
of Her Royal prerogative te grant specis.I leave
of appeal frorn the High Court to Rer Majesty
In Council. The Parliament may make laws
limiting the mattera In which such leave may
be aased. but proposed laws containlng any
such limitation shaîl be reaerved by the Gov-

ernor General for Her Majesty's plea-sure.

You will cee that in Australia they do
not wish the Judicial Comrnittee of the
Privy Couincil to interfere with special
constitutional cases. They want te have
their own interpretatien of their ewn conAs far as ronstitustitutinn in Au.-tralia
tional cases are concerned in this country,
we know for instance that' a Private Bill
presented in the lieuse of Commons or the

Senate cen be referred te the
Court of Canada te know whether
stitutional or net. I do nlot think
very otten, but we possess the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Supreme
it je Conit je dQne
Tight to

make such a reference. In that case it is
simply a matter of advice; the judgment is
not ibinding in any way. Well, if it is
only a bit of information that we get frorn
the Supreme Court, giving their opinion,
I do not se& why, especially if that opinion did not suit us, we should net get the
opinion ef somebo-dy else across the water.
In a case like that the question of cost does
net arise, because, in the case of Bills and
constitutional cases there is always plenty
of money, as it ie the public at large that
pays and the expense ,is in proportion to
the value et the services rendered. I must
apologize to the House for having taken so
long on this question, and also apologize to
the legal fraternity for having without permission penetrated into their sanctumn sanctorum; but I believe that we cannot take
too, serions a view et the position we occupy*
in this House, and I dlaim that every man,
iii his humble way, ehould be prepared to
exp$ress hie opinion on public questions
and not be ashamed to do so because hie
may not belorng to the legal fraternity.
On the motion being put:
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I should hardly
expect that this House would allow a
motion of this nature to pase without discussion. It is certainly a very important
question. I do not rise to make any argument whatever, but eimply to say that.
earlier in ny lite 1 sornewhat shared the
view of the hion. senator who has justspoken; in tact, 1 was opposed entirely to
the Supreme Court, and I think I spoke once
or twice againet it. But like many others,
I presume, 1 have lîved to learn more thaii
1 thenl knew:-and my etrong conviction now
is that the 'present right of'appeal from the
Supreme Court is very valuable to the
country, and I for one would be very eorry
ta cee the people of thie country deprived
of that rigaht. In cases involving- only questions of inoney the Provincial Governiment
should be in a position ta say that no appeal
should be allowed unless the sumi involved
reaches a certain arnouint: but thiere are
many other questions, where nionetary
considerations are not involved, which are
rnuch more important to the people of the
country than cases involving only questions
of money. So many questions have arisen
since the Dominion of Canada becamne a
Contederation that were neyer presenit at the
time of Contedei'ation to the minds of able
public men at that tirne, and whichi have
had to be taken to the Supremne Court. and

APRIL 6, 1916

many others which 1 think miglit have
been taken to the Supreme Court in the interest of the country, that 1 arn sure those
who are charged with the responsibility of
iegislating in the public interest will agree
with me that the question now under consideration ouglit to b. deait with very care!ully and very thoughifully, not only by
the ablest jurists and lawyers in the country, but by the ablest legisiators as well. It
would be very regrettable if it should go
on record that this Rouse showed s0 littie
interest in this motion that they allowed
it to pass as if it represented the unaniînouF
sentiment of the Senate.

Justice, whoever lie may lie to-day or to,norrow, to the fact that Canada's interest
in regard to judicial matters along commercial, financial or other suchli nes shouid be
settled once and for ail in Canada; and
when g-rave questions of constitutional
rights, privileges or obligations arise under
the Blritish North America Act, that they
still- b. lef t to the decision of the Privy
Council as long as the British North America Act lias force.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I wouid be disposed to support the motion made by my
lion. friend from De Lanaudière because I
betieve in the principle coîîtained therein.
CLORAN-I believe with the In the session of 1912-13 a debate took place

Mon. Mr. Béicjue-Yes, we arc azking ln each
case whether the judgmz-nt was confirrned or reversed by the Privy Counc.1l or Supremne Court.

1 find nothing on the subj ect in the report
of the proceedings of this House for the
session that followed, 1914-15, but I arn
under the impression that no committee
was formed duririg that year. The wvar intervened and our minds have been mostly
in other channels.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I think they did meet
in 1914.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-My hon. friend
from Halifax thinks they did meet in the
following session.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If they did they
neyer reported.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-There bas beenl
no report. I do not see any objection to
debating the prînciple, whichi 1 favour, but
it seems to me that we should next session
continue the work of investigation which
this committee started, by re-appointing a
similar commjttee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-May I implement
what bas just been-stated? The committee
did meet, and collected valuable information, including statistica from the Exchequer Court, from the Prothonotary
of the Superior 'Court of Montreal and
from the Registrar o! the Supreme Court
of Ontario at Toronto.- 1 think some of the
information was tabulated, and I believe
I arn not mistaken in saying that some of
it was printed, and that very valuable evidence was given before the committee on
which to base a report. While I amn on my
feet perhaps I might be allowed to give my
own view.
Hon. Mr. ýGIRROIR-Did not Mr. Ewart
speak before that committeeP
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT-Yes, and Mr.
Cameron was there too. My own view is
that there is very littie for this Parliament
to do in the matter. It is a question which
must be deait with alniost exclusively, if
not altogether, .by the provinces. There is
no appeal .to-day from the Supreme Court
of Canada to the Privy Council as o! right.
The only appeal frorn the Privy Council is
by leave. Well, that is not in our hauds.
We cannot touch the Royal prerogative.
The only way in which appeals to the
Privy Council eau be limited is by provincial enactmrent. The provinces mey increase the amounts necessary to give jurisMon. Mr. DANDUP-AN»)

diction to the Privy Council. That rnay be
proper, but it is none of our business. Not
only is it none of our business, but I
rather think the provinces would resent
advice frorn us on a subject of that kind.
They would probably state that they are
the judges of what is best for their own
people. I doubt very muoh if that coinmittee can do any useful work in view of
the inability or wvant of power on the part
of this Parliament to toucli the inatter at
ail.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUeHEED-I hope mny hion.
friend will not insist upon this motion being
submitted to the House this afternoon, or
even during the presenit session. It seemns
to me that more mature thought should be
given to any representation which the Senate o! Canada niay make on such an important question, particularly upon a question involving so much constitutional interest, and one in which, as my lion. friend
from Ottawa said, the provinces are interested. My hon. friend may have overlooked
the fact that hie has introduced a principle
into his resolution which is not recognized,
so far as I know, as fundamental in giving
jurisdiction to any Appellate Caurt-that a
unanimous judgment of the court may not
be appealed from. My hon. frîend will observe that the principle which hie embodies
in this motion is that if the judgment o!
the Supreme Court be unanimousHon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Then it does not
go any further.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That then an
appeal to the Privy Counicil shall not lie.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIIN-That is righlt.
Hon. Mr. LOUGH-EED-T-hat means that
it is in the bands, say, of one judge, who
inay pronounce a dîssenting judg-ment, to
give an appeal to the Privy Council. Now,
the jurisdiction of an appellate tribunal has
neyer been based upon that principle, viz.,
that of a unanimous judgment of the court
appealed from. The fundamental principle
of ail appeals is placed upon a very miuch
higher basis than.that which. is involved in
the motion. I hope that wit.hout more
mature consideration being given to such a
very important subject as this, the Senate
of Canada wiIl not make a pronouncemeut,
more particularly as we appointed at a
previous session a comrnittee to make a
report upon this subject-a cominittee which

to amend the Oustomns Tariff Act, 1907.'

SENATE
(In the Committ ee'>
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I shoui1d like to ask
hy what amount the, Government expect to
enrich themselves by the customns tax on
apples?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Hon. gentlemen
on the other side rather misapprehended
what I said about apples. I did flot say that
the imposition of this tax, namely. 50 cents
a barrel, was for the purpose of i.ncreasing
the revenue. What I said was that the
imposition on crude oil was for the purpose ef adding to the revenue, an>d it is
estimated that the increased. duty will
realize about $500,000.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-WVhich one of
those oils.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Item 267. It is
estimated the increased revenue will represent about $500,000.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The hon. gentleman
does not expeet a revenue from the increased duty on applea?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-We have not considered that. We have placed a duty upon
apples for the purpose of prcmoting the
industry in the pitovince of my hon. friend
the, leader of the Opposition. The Government bas exercised peculiar solicitude li
this Bill te promote the interests o! British
Columbia, and yet my hon. friend is very
strongly opposed to it. The duty on
apples -will have a beneficial efleet
in promoting the apple industry there.
duty upon crude oil

As
my hon. friend-overlooked. entiTely yesterday the tact that one of the largest and
most prosperous industries in the province
of British Columbia is the coal industry,
and the importatiocn of crude cil from the
Pacifie coast, par'ticularly from California,
has very seriously *affected the output of
the coal mines of the province.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Yesterday 1 was
arguing in favour of protecting the forests
of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-We are flot
touching the forests. I do not find anything here about forests.
Hon. "Air. BOSTOCK-I might say that
I think the use of cil as a fuel on railways
is a very good thing in the interests cf
the forests cf this country. My hon. friend
has referred to the duty on fruit. This
morning 1 received a paper from British
Columabia in which. attention is drawn te
the faet that the Provincial Governsnent
Hon. Mr. EDWÂRDS.

had prcvided the expenses cf a delegation
to come down to Ottawa and ask the Dominion Governinent te raise the duty on
apples coming into this coun'try. I do not
kncw whether it is the regular thing for
Provincial Gcvernnien'ts te pay exl;enses cf
delegations coming dcwn te Ottawa fer
sîmilar purposes.
Hon. Mr. LOUGREED-It is not se important as te warrant that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-My hon. -friend
yesterday. in the discussion which we ¶had
on another motion, urged that the various
parts of the country should pull together
for the general interests cf the Dominion.
lit seems, to me that there is a geod dcal
of question between the different provinces
as to whethier this duty on apples is in
the general înteres'ts cf the country.
Hon. M-%r.
DAVIS-My hon. friend h-as
askncwledged that the duty on apples is
not for revenue, but for 'the purpese of
protecting the industry, increasing the
price t-o the people who use apples.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN - They are dear
encugh now.
Honi. Mr. DAVIS-We should endeavoux
tc> do the greatest gcod to the greatest number. Fifty men are eating apples where one
man grows ithem. Why shculd they tax
the fifty men for the benefit of the one?
Hon. Mr. LOU-GHEED-So that they
could grow upples for the fifty.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-If you want to encourage the-Tn, give 'them a bonus. If it
is in the interest cf the whole of the people
cf Canada that these people should be
given a bonus fer grcwing apples, give it
to thein, but the 'people who eat apples
should net be 'taxed.
Hen. Mr. POWER-I notice that hon.
gentlemen on tthis side cf the Hou se have
failed to see one very cheering circumnstance in connection willh the duty cn
appleis. It will be remembered that on
several very important articles cf consump'tion in this country the pres-ent Government has reduced ithe British preference
f ren 33 to 5 per cent, and in some cases,
1 think, abolished it altog-ether; but hon.gentlemen will feel relieved to see that with
respect to apples they preserve t.he old high
British preference. The duty on apples
commng frein B.ritain is only -60 cts., while
the duty on apples corning from other countries is 90 ets. 1 think if my hon. friend

A QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.

Honi. Mr. CASGRAIN-I should like to
draw attention ta the portion of the Library
of Parliament which has not been burned
down. Laat Wednesday atternaon I was
working in the Library preparing the speech
which I delivered yesterday, and I dhl, not
notice that one by one the workmen went
away. About haî-f past six I found 1 was
locked in the Library. I roamed. about the
place, but found not a living soul there.
I went back to my work and waited, I do
not know how long, when I heard steps,
and a man came along without a badge or
uniform to show that hie had any right to
be there. I did not know whether hie was
an intruder, possibly a German spy, who
might blow up the place or set it on fire.
I asked hlm who hie was and hie said «'I
arn the caretaker." I asked him if -lie was
ail alone to take care of this valuable
*Library, and hie said «"yes." I said " Have
you any arins,- he said, " None whatever,
I have niy fists." I said, "That would not
be nîuch protection. Any one could overpower you.- He said, -"There are a couple
of constables outside." I said, -"That inay
bie, but it seems to me after what has happened there shou]d be at least two guardians, and they should bie thoroughly

somnething should happen him, a fire might
start there with nobody to cope with it. I
amn informed this marning that there are

THE NAVAL AID BILL.
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.

Hon. 'Mr. CLORAN-Before the Orders of
the Day are taken up, as a question of high
privilege it may well behoove this honourable Chamber to take cognizance of a seriou7
attack upon the constitutional rights and
privileges of the Senate of Canada, as well
as the honesty and integrity and independence of its members. -In the first place the
Senate has been an object of denunciation
on the publie platform, the pulpit and the
public press, and even on the floor of the
House, but the rship of state has safely
got through ail these gales -and stornis of
adverse criticism and is still riding
supremely on the waves of public and political activities of the nation. But alas, an

days ago the Prime Minister officially informed Parliament and the country that
if his -Government had no naval aid to
give the Empire in the present war, it was,
because the Senate had deterxnined to rejeet any measure providing for the saie.

The Bill was read the first tifne.
Hon. Mr.* LOUGHEED-With a view ta
ohtaining a second reading ai this Bill tanight, 1 move that rules 23, 24a and 63 be
suepended s0 far as they relate ta this Bill.
His Excellency the Deputy Governar is
caming down to-marraw for the purpose ai
giving assent ta this Bill. As hon, gentlemen know, the fiscal year ends on the 31st
March, and it is very desiraible tbat this
money sbould be available at once. The
Prime Minister apparently discussed this
matter with the leader ai the Opposition
in the Commans, and the Bill passed that
bouse with the assent ai the Opposition.
It is made up ai practically three items.
The first arnount, $28,713,666.40, has heen
already voted; the second amaunt, $20,744,
931.01, isla fifth ai the General Estimates,
and the third item, 350,000,000, is one-fifth
of tbe war appropriation, for whieh a resahutian was brought down, namely, one-fifth
of 8250,000,000, the Bill appropriating in al
899,458,597.41. The total remaining ta be
voted ai the General Estimates wbicb have
been brought down. is $132,501,7.35.98, Iesp
certain deductions.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The lion. gentleman
mentianed twa items first. What were tbey?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The two items
are $28,713,666.40, and the second item J20,744,931.01.
Hon. Mr. POWER-For whiat?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-One-fifth ai the
arnount ai the Estîmates brought down, and
then there is $50,000,000, which is one-fiftli
ai the total war appropriation, which bhas
been brought down by resolution.
The motion was agreed ta.

as Deputy Governor. 1 assume that the
judge who came the other day had such
commission, but it was not submitted ta
the Senate. That, I think, is a seriaus
irregularity. I truet that the gentleman
who cornes down to assent ta the Bill tamorrow will have bis commission.
Uon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I xnight say ta
my hon. 1-riend i romn Halifax that there bas
not been any uniformity in our practice af
issuing commissions from time ta time ta
the Deputy Gaývernor. Some times the commission is read at thé table ai the Hause;
at other times it only appears in the
Minutes, and is not read. For instance, on
the hast occasion, when the Deputy Gavernar, Mr. Justice Idington, came down, bis
commission was nat read at the table af
the House, but it appeared in the Minutes
of that day.

this recruiting. We have already in this
country too many enlisted men who will
neyer reach the front ta take an active
part in the war. The right hon. the Premier recently said in the House of Gommons that there are 135,000 enlisted men in
Canada waiting ta -be transported to
Europe, because we have no steamers to
take thein across the Atlantic. Under these
circumstances, I ask if it is not the duty
osf the Government to stop recruiting. As
has been said by Lord Shaughnessy and
other people, it is a great waste of money,
time and men to recruit more men, when
we cannot send those already enlisted to
the seat of war. Certain men are adopting
the military profession and are 'willing Vo
enlist. I congratulate theni on that, if they
feel it their duty to do something for the
Empire. They are paid Vo do something,
but probably soine of them are adopting
the calling for their own amusement, and
Vo make a living.

I feel that 1 have a slight grudge against
both af these lion. -gentleinen. because the
speeches that they have made have been
sa interesting and etimulating that my few
rather duli remarks will seern unusually
dull after those sparkling effusions.
The subject ta which I cail attention here,
and as ta which 1 seek the opinion af the
Government, is ane ai very considerable
cansequence. I had the honour ai bringing this matter before the Senate 'in the
session af 191-13, and it was at that time
discussed at some -length. 1 hope it may
be discussed at sanie length on -this accasion. Things have progressed smnce then.
In the first place 1 think it is desirable that
the hion. members of the House should
the position is and what the
knaw %what
facts are. By chapter 30 ai the Revised
Statutes, section 43, it is provided that
there shall be allowed ta depositars, bath
in the Postal Savings banks and in what
are called the Governmient Savings banks,
a rate afi nterest not exceeding 4 per cent
per annum, such rate ta be deterrmined by
the Governar in Council. 1 think it well
to cail attention ta the exact wording of
that section ai the. Act, because there appears ta be an impression on the mainds of
a great many members, both ai this Hanse
and ai the other House, that the rate is
fixed at 3 per cent and that'it would require a statute ta alter the rate. .That is
not the case. The rate can be Taised fromn
3 te, 3ý or 4 per cent any day by an 'Order
in Council. The rate in the early days
was at first 3 per cent. Then it was raised
ta 3j per cent, and then, in the year 1898,
reduced ta, 3 per cent. The reason given
far that Teduction was that in the anoney
market at that tirne, rnoney was nat bringing mare than 3 per cent, and it was felt
it was not a business-like thing an the
part af the Government ta pay mare than
3 per cent when they could get money
elsewhere for less. At the tinte, in 1913,
when the matter was brought up, the Government wer,ý paying practically 3î-3.77
per cent, and at that, time no action was
taken by the House Or by the - Government. on grounds in w~hichi there was a
great deal of force. It was alleged, I Teniember, on behalf of the Government, that
they were put ta a certain amount ai expense in providing- the administration ai

making practically another five per cent;
and the Governnment will in future pay five
per cent an this loan of $75,000,000, although
they have received less than $71,000,000.
Now surely hion, gentlemen, when you look
at that, you find that here ig a Government
that got into power practically largely on
the policy that they 'wished to, have nothing
whatever ta do with aur neighboura te the
south, and yau find that they are making
a present of nearly $4,000,000 ta the
bankers and brokers in New York, and
are ta, pay in future five per cent on
$75,000,000, while they are getting only
$71,000,000. The samne Government apparently did not think that they could pay
four per cent ta their own peaple, who are
living here and contributing ta maintain the
'Government. In view af the attitude assurned by the hon. leader ai the Gov ernment in 1913. the time has carne wvhen the

That is true, but the iact is that, while a
considerable portion ai the money is deposited by people who, are fairly well-off,
the great majarity ai the depositars are not

they do not jike to do it, because if one
poor man must back a note for another, it
compels him to do the same for some one
else, and it alwaya makes him afraid of
getting him into trouble if hie does so.
What is the result? Such men are shut
out from those publie utilities, because no
matter how honest, industious or frugal
they are, they cannot borrow unles-s they
get somebody to back their note; their
property %vould not be regarded as a sufficient backing for them. I arn pleased to
say that the banks have changed their opinion very much,_and to-d-ay are dealing very
largely with the farmers. 1 have alrways
held that the farmer is the most stable
man in the country; hie cannot dispose of
his property in a day without it beinknown to the world, and therefore he eaunot get out in the mniddle of the nig-ht without paying his debts. Notwithstanding that,
the .bank would not ]end to a farmer unless hie got a backer every time. He is
not cornpelled to do that now. What does
a poor man do when hie wants to borrow?
He goes 'to a bank, where he is getting
3 per cent and he has to pay 7 or 8 per
cent. He thinks the difference between what
he Ruts and what he has te pay is an awful
hardéhip. The requirements of the bank
are so great that he is embittered against
the institution. It is no great wond.er
tliat the iron is drîven into his soul, thst
he rarely ever forgets it, and you are building up between him and thein an impassable barrier that makes hixu always regard
theni as lis enemy. 1 think this could
be rernedied. In Gernxany years ago they
remedied this trouble; how? By »tarting
small banks for the farmers, and arranging
that farmers could get small Mains at a
xnoderate rate of interest. We tried that
4iere three or four tiines, but neyer could
devise a scheme that seemed to be absolutely workable by those whoin we consulted. Therefore, it was neyer accomplished; but Jl think that Parliament is
designed for thé purpose of overcoming
such difficulties, and if we apply ourselves
to the task and endeavour to find a remedy,
we caný find one, and meet one of our great
needs. While only 143,000 people hiave
taken advantage of the saving bank
we might easily have ten times that
number of depositors if we offered
thexu a stronger inducement by paying
them a little higher rate of intereat.
The Government, as the hon. senator has
said, are borrowing money ail the time.

We sold our bonds only a few months ag-o,
and ivhat did they realize? Five per cent
on those bonds. Why, if you were gîying
poor people of the country in the savings
bank-I do flot care what the nature of it
was-5 per cent for their money, there would
be t-wo or three times more money deposited
in the Government Savings banks of the
country than what those bonds were sold
for, and that was $100,000,000. Whien we
raised that interest to 3?xper cent a few
years ago what did we find? That the deposits went up and up from year to year
untîl, speaking from memory, there was
about $48,000,000 to the credit of the poox
people in the country. The rate las becu
reduced and it is going down ail the tiinc
until at present it is only $39,995,000. And
why is it so low? The Government rnit
just as iveli have had the use of the nolne%
froin thieir own citizens at home, payin «
L
thein a higher rate of interest thani they
are paying nowv, and yet pay them Iess than
they are paying others who have boughit
the Government bonds at the present tie;
and that would be a strong inducement foi
the poor man to put lis money away
where it would earn hixu a littie better
rate than he can get at present. Fer these
reasons I have always said that the Government has neyer done its full duty ln
this respect. They would have money r
deposît that they could use for many purposes, and prevent the necessity for that
borrowing abroad and paying a higher rate
of interest for it if they could only arrange
to, get the money from their own citizens
at home and -pay them a littie higher interest than the current rate. I think tha-,
might well be paid, but surrounded by such
conditions that no one could take advantage of it to deposit more than a given
aniount a year. The Government inight
well pay at least 4 per cent for that money
and it would be one of the very best institutions for the poor people of this country that Parliament could establish.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I feel that this debate should not be closed without paying a
tribute to the hon. the senior ruember for
Halifax and to the hon. senator from Gray
who has just taken his seat. Tribute is

purpose of lending te commerce and trade,

from capitalists who can affoNd ta lend
their money -for two or three or four or five
years.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Tbat makes the argument stronger .again-st the banks.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-It is suggested that
the G1overnment shculd raise the rate of
interest on deposits which are made psjyable on demand. There are two provisions
in the Savings Bank Act. There is the provision allowing any one to deposit with the
Post Office banks a sum not exceeding $500,
which he can withdraw at any time without
notice, and on which the Government is allowed ta pay an interest not exceeding 4
per cent. There is, howevrer, another provision which is ta be found in section 10 of
the same Act. Chap. 30 of the Revised
Statutes which. allows the Government ta
issue certificates of deposits in sums o! nlot
lesa than $100 and bearing interest at a rate
not exceeding 5 per cent per annum ta depositors having like sume at the credit of
their ordinary deposit account, and desiring
ta transfer such suma !rom the ordinary deposit account, bearing the interest specified
therein. This provision allows the Governlment, if they wish ta do so, ta increase the
rate ta 5 per cent, butý the deposit instead
o! being payable on demand becomes
payable after a term, and it is for
the Government ta deterniine the term. It
was announced a month or two -ago, I think
by the Finance Minister, that possibly tjîe
Government would borrow in the country
through deposits of that nature sums o!
$100 and more in order to allow everybody
willinga ta invest with the Governinent ta
do so on certificates of that kind. For my
part I see no objections to that, and I
think the banks have no objection ta
that being done, but th-at is a different
thing from a deposit payable on demand.
Hon. gentlemen must bear in mind that
when a bank or the Government pays a rate
of 3 per cent ta depositors, it does not mean
that the money costs only that 3 per cent
ta the bank or Government. The bank, like
the Government, must have officers and
clerks, and if any hon, gentleman takes
the trouble ta inquire into the niatter, lie
will find that the money, instead o! costing
the bank 3 per, cent, costs the bank 4 per

is quite manifest tha't if the depositors

where nîoney is bor'rowed for a definite

are practically payable on demand., I think
the longest notice that has to be given is
thirty days. Under the circuanstances the

take but a small amount of money to finish
the line. The work was very difficult,
through caves and rock, and must have
cost between $60,000 and $70,000 a mile for
many miles. It je now ready for the ties,
and could be put in operation, perhaps, in
four or five monthe. It-is thought by Quebec people, and in the interests of Quebec
and the country at large, that the Government ougbt to acquire that railway from
the Union station at Quebec and continue
it as far as Murray Bay to St. Catherine
Bay as a feeder to the Tranexcontinental.
We ai know that .Murray l3ay je a summer
resort, and 1 srn confident that the re#ýenue
will ibe large enough to pay the interest on
the bonde and expenses af operation. We
ail know thet there are indu.stries in that
region which cannot be utilized for want
of communication. I rnight say, en passant, that thie line of rai.lway, when in
operation, will develop such industries as
the Baie De St.. Paul Lumber Company,
the St. Simeon Lumber Company, the Price
Bros., Ltd., 'the Irene Lumber Company,
and the large farming population below
Québec. The only mneans et preeent in winter cf bringing their produce te market je
by travelling sixty or eighty miles over the
mouritains to Quebec. The Government je,
therefore, obliged to send a specialV boat to
those places before the close of navigation
to transport poultry, ibeef, rnutton, and all
other products cf the farma to market. With
this line in operation the Government wil
gave the cost of runningu thatboat. At the
pressing dernand of the numerous population -of that section, the Government, saine
years ago, duringy the Laurier regime, estabiehed corne communication between Rivière
Ouelle and Queýbec. They built a line from
the Intercoloniai railway te the Rivière
Quelle wharf, and have had a steamer to
make a crossing ivhenever possible in order
to give means of communication to the
population on the north shore. From Nov-ember to May they could have -no communication whatever with Quebec, except
by driving, as «I said, over sixty or eighty
miles cf inountain roads, the trip by that
route corne times occupying days. The
Laurier Government thought it only fair to
spend money te give an outiet te these
people. Th-ey are the oldest parishes below
Quebee, and have always paid their share
for providing public utilities. They voted
money to build this part of the railway to
Rivière Quelle, and to have a cros sing
there. Unfortunately, the crossing could

not be regularly maintained in the winter

fallows:
How many tripe were made by the steamer
Champlain, or any other steamer under Government contrai, between Rivière OueIle wharf
and St. Irenée or Murray Bay tram the lot
December Up ta the present date?

And I reoeivied. the following answer:
Hon. Mr. Lougheed-The steamer Champlain
made lftty-two round trips between Rivière
Ouelie wharf and St. Irenée wharf or Murray
Bay tram the lot December, 1915, ta date.

They could net even cross once in two
daye. I was not satisfled with that, and I
asked anather question on the 3rd March,
as follows:
1. What wae the cost, tram the lot JuIy, 1913,

of a ferry between the Rivière OuelIe wharf
and St. Irenée and Murray Bay?
2. Have there been many complainte respecting the efficiency af thie service?
3. For -how many days, each wlnter. bas the
service been completely interrupted since the.
let December. 1913?

Andi 'I received the following answer:
Hon. Mfr. Lougheed-The aniuwers to the hon.
gentleman's questions are:
1. $143.836.08.
2. Several complainte have been received this
winter.
3. December 24. 1913, the Champlain did not
cross owtng to NU. gale and snow starrn. She
was wlthdrawn tramn the service December 27,
and came up ta Quebec where she remalned

Last year the Government bought three
railways in New Brunswick and the Lower
Provinces-the New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island railway, the International
Tailway of New Brunswick, and the St. John
and Quebec railway. They t>ock themn as
feeders ta the Intercolonial railway, I suppose. Well, they paid well for those lines,
pro.bably more than the Quebec and
Saguenay railway would cost, snd the peopie in those localities had already good

ineans of communication. 'The
and Saguenay railway in one way or
another will have ta be taken over by the

what bas been done in New Brunswick
they should do in Quýebec. In New Brunswick they had the Intercolonial railway
syatem, yet they came toi -the rescue of
these conûpanies and took over those three
railways. This is noît a party question.
Moreover, it is not the coinpany alone that
is seeking ta have that railway taken over
by the Dominion Government and finished,
but it is also the province of Quebec. In

Prime Mlniuter.
he said. « the Government had under consideration the reintroduction of the Naval Aid Bill of
1912, but thought such reintroduction undesirable
unless there was some reasonable prospect that
it wo uld not be defeated in the Senate. Confidential Inquiries were made for the purpose
of ascertaining whether such a Bill either in
its original farm or ln some modified, form
might be expected ta pass the Senate; thus enabling Canada to assume her proper share in
maintaining the common defence of the Empire..,
It was reported to, the Prime Mînister as a
reeult of these Inquiries that no assurance could
be given 0f the acceptance by the Senate either
of the Naval Aid Bill ln its original forma or
of a modified proposai which the Government
were prepared ta conuider. For this reason no
action was talcen as it was thought undesirable
ta renew the controversy without any reafonable hope that the Government's proposaI would
be carried in the Senate.
Inexpedient at Present.
In 1914, with the view of formulating a permanent policy of naval defence, It was arranged
with the Admiralty that Admidrai Sir John
Jellicoe shauld visit Canada in August or
September for the purpose of giving to, the Government the benelt*of his wide lrnowledge and
experience. Wbile arrangements for his visit
were still ln progress, the war brake <übt.
Thereafter the Governnient ascertained that
in the opinion of the Imperial authorities the
efforts and resources of Canada should be concentrated during the present war upon the organization. training and equipment of military
forces and that it would be inexpedient for the
Canadian Government under the circumastances
to undertake at present the provision of assistance in naval defence upon any considerable
scale.

Hon. 'Mr. POW*ER_-As I undcrstanàd it,

the leader of the Government in ti
lias stated thst hç wii net answer the
question. That ls an answer of course and
ends the question, but I was very sorry
indeed Wohear the hon. leader of the Government mske that statement, because
while .1 have nothing te do witli this inquiry, and have net mucli sympathy with
it, still I -think tliat the Senate sliould have
a certain regard for its own standing. I
look upon this as being in a sense
a question of privilege, and 'the answcr that the honourable leader cf the
Government lias given is net tlie sort
of rep]y that should be given Wo a question dealing with the privileges Ml the
Senate. As I undcrstand, the Senate lias
been reflected u-pon. It did net trouble me,
but a number ef bon. gentlemen feit bliat
they liad been reflectcd upon by the speech
which is recited in this notice, and I think
they -have a xright te inquire wlietlier the
leader cf the G'overnment used that ian.
guage, because I do inot think lie sliould
have used such language about oe brandi
of Parliainent.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Before raising a
question cf privilege, I thouglit XL oniy
fair te the lien. leader cf the Goevernmcnt

anything further it is ini their hands to take
action. As to the remark made by the hon.

inquiry put back imb the Order PaperHon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I did not put it
that way; I simpWy directed their -attention te 'the fact.
The SPEAKER-Yes, but I think that
the duty of the clerks is te take the advie
of the 'Speaker on the matter.

'Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I understand t.he

been answered, and that ends the question;
but it is open to the hon. member te ask

QUESTION OP PRIVILFGE.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Bef are the
Orders of the Day are called, 1 wish to
direct the attention of the House to a
report appearing ini the Montreal Gazette
of this morning of 'the few words I said
yýesterday about recruiting. I do not object te the report itself, even as it appears
in the Gazette, but the heading of the report in the Gazette is objectionable, especially the words. " Laurier's protégé makes
extraordinary statements ini reference to
Toronto," etc. We see at once the object
of using this big heading, quoting me as
«'Laurier's protégé." Any man in the.
Senate or in the *orld might be proud ta
be Laurîer's protégé; but the heading is
used to put on Laurier the responsibility
for what I said, and I protest against it as
unfair and unjust, if nat dishonest. I arn
surprised to find it in a paper ordinarily
as well informed and honest es 'the Gazette. I take on myself the. whole respansibility of my words in this House and
outside, and I proteat most strongly against
the report connecting my words with the
name of Sir Wi.lfrid -Laurier, tJhe great
leader of the Liberal party, in order by insinuation ta represent him as being responsible for what I said. I advocated Liberal principles èfor thirty years under Sir
Wilfrid Laurier in the other House, but
we ail know-I grieye to say it but must
do sa in order that the responsibility for
my actions and words may be properly
fixed-that aver ten years ago I had some
difference with Sir Wrilfrid Laurier about

APRIL 13, 1916

what he should do. I have the greatest'respect for Sir Wilfrid, and I hope lie has
friendship for me, but we differed ten years
ago when I had te take part agAinst the
Premier of Quebec at the time. Again, nlot
more than five years ago I opposed Sir Wilfrid Laurier on bis Naval Bull; I took t.he
responsibility of my sitand on that occasion, and I know the Tories were very glaci
-te use my speech and my _'views against
Sir Wilfrid Laurier at that time, ta serve
their purpese. The Gazette aays that I
have been criticiaing the kind of men that
have been enlisted. If yeu read the report you will see that I did net say a word
against the men they have been recruiting,
but I put before this House an extract from
the Daily "MNail cf Toronto, a good Tory
paper, proteetiflg against the kind of recruiting that is going on. I put in a letter
from a good Englîsh Tory cf Toronto protesting most strongly againat the class cf
Englishmen that are being recruited there.
These are net my words, net my expressions; I just gave them ta the public in an
honest way, taking themn from the Toronto
Mail and frgm an Englishman. who ie well
known te my hon.'friend, General Maso2n.
It is most unfair ta distort my speech, and
I amn surprised that an ordinarily respectable paper like the Gazette should put such
a heading over my remarks. I have not.hing
to Say against the reporter here; -he is net
responsible for the headings used by the
Gazette.

therein;
recruiting or the character of our recruita, are
of the simailest possible Importance. It la flot
likeiy that they wouid be reported In the press.
But when these opinions are volced by a senator
of Canada, they acquire from this officiai relation a character which the Parliament of Caný
adae can hardiy overiook.
Choquette's reported insulta tQ the men who
are comning forward to die for this country, for
liberty and demaocracy, cannat sting. Their
origin robe themn of that power. But that a
senator of Canada shouid be permitted ta make
these statements ia the Senate of Canada regarding men in Canadian khaki, Who will presently
be holding the Candian Unes 'lsomewhere in
France," la simply intolerable!
It is somewhat difficuit ta get rid of a senator.
But the British North Axnerica Act says that
" the place of a senator shall became vacant...
if he be attainted of treason." It further says
that " if any question arises respecting the
qualifications of a senator . . . the samne shai be
heard and determined by the Senate."
This seemns ta put the unsavory Choquette
case up ta the Senate. If 'they decide that
Choquette's ravings ainount ta treason, they can
rid themseives of his presence. Failing that,
we fancy that an address. passed by bth Houses
of Pariament, with fair unanimity, wouid accompiish this timely act of house-cleaning.

Is it the intention of -the Govern'ment or
the Senate Wotake any action in reference
te the mater?
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-I desire to put
a question to the bon. gentleman.
Hon. Mr. LOL'GHEED.

DOMINION FOREST RESERVES AND
PARKS ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
REXPORTED

PROU COMMITTEE.

The House resolved itaelf into a Conimittee of the Whole on Bill (80), An Act ta
amend the Dominien Forest Reserves and
Parks Act.
In the CommitteeOn Clause 1:
1. Section two of the Dominion Forest Re-

servez and Parka Act, chapter ten of the etatutes of 1911, in amended by adding thereto
the foiiowing subsection:
"2. Where any Dominion lands within the
boundarlez of any reserve bave been soid prior

H-on. Mr. LOUGHEED-When this Bill
was before the senate for third reading, I
explained that it w*as a technical measul'O

the Dominion Lands Act the minunder
ister had authority ta do this, but saine
deubt bas been expressed as te whether it
extends te the Dominion Forest Rserves.
I therefore meve the adoption of clause 1.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The granting cf these
Dominion Lands patents is a subjeet "aste
which differ-ences of e. serieus characterotten
arise, and in looking at clause 1, the only
clause in the Bill, I find that if there is an
error in the name, place-.of residence or
occupation of the person te whomn such
lands were se sold, or in the description cf
the lands, the Minister cf the Interior may,
there being ne adverse dlaim, direct the
defective letters patent ta be cancelled. and
letters patent te be issued with such corrections or alterations' as he may deem
la there any
necessary in the premises.
method described by the statute which this
Bill propeses te amend for the submitting
of these adverse clainis?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Where there are
adverse dlaims they are invarîably referred
ta the Exchequer Court. It may be a
question cf fraud; it usually is a question
of fraud or misrepresentatieil as ta whether

the patent was properly issued, or should
be issued. Consequently the machinery of
the Exchequer Court is pecùliarly well
adapted ta settie a question of that kind.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Then it occurs ta me
that, instead of directmng that these defective
retters patent be cancelled, and letters
patent with 8uch corrections or alterations
as May be necessary issned by the minister,
perhaps it would be better to have the
minister issue a sort of patent containing
the corrections.

authority ta cancel the letters patentý

point.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Or he niay correct or alter the letters patent by way of
cancellation. That is only in cases where
there is no adverse dlaim.
Hon Mr. POWER-I arn not convinced
yet.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I do not quite
follow the hon. gentleman.
Hon. Mr. POWERL-The point ia this.
The patent bas been issued: there is smre
defect in the description, or -mistake in the
naine of the person ta whomn the patent is

a way yeu go back ta the time when there
was ne encunibrance on the land, and yeu

I think is the reasonable thing ta do. Why
should a minister, of his own motion, have
the right ta cancel letters patent which are
supposed to be signed by the Governor
General' I think it would be botter just te
have the corrections made and indicated in
the new document.
Hon. Mr. ROSS -(Middleton)-I do net
agree wvith the hon. gentleman on that point.

could have said that at the titine, but, despising the article as I did, I would not degrade myself and the Senate by raising a
question of pnivilege. when every menesber of
-this honourable House heard .rny epeech. It
would have been insulting to members of
this Chamber if I had taken exception te it
en a question of prîvilege. By implication it
would have been st.ating that the Senate,
having heard my speech, if insulting aur
soldiers, did not stand up and rebuke me
for having done so. It would have been
an insult to the Speaker of the Senate,
whose son has been on the battlefield for
seven or eight months. It would have
been an insult for the hon. member for

honest way, and it seemed to me that I was
fulfilling my duty in saying so. What was
the resuit? I have a brother who has been
employed in the Immigration Department
in Montreal for the past eight years, and

Economy. I was answered. I inquired what
was the number of men em'ployed in that

answer 18, and how many employed 110w,
and the an3wer was 30. Therefore, that man,
though hie had done nothing to menit dismissal, but simply because hie was my

,have said nothing whieh can ho taken ex,ception to .by any soldiers in this country. I
amn willing to abide by the decision of any
committee appointed by this House to say
whether I have been guilty of any offence
against the Army or Navy. If I should be
convicted of any such offence I arn willing
te apologize. not only to the soldiers but te
the Senate. But, hon, gentlemen, what was
my effence? Âfter discussing the question,
I quoted an article from the Mail and
Empire, of Toronto, the organ cf the Government-a good Tory paper, as hon, gentlemen
know. I selected a Conservative paper se
that I could flot be accused cf partisanship.
This paper published the report of the
health commissioner of Toronto, in which
it appears that te form two 1battaliona
they had te refuse over 50 per cent in the
first case and over 75 per cent in the
second. It was thoni that I received a letter from a man named Hazelton, of Todmordon, Ontario, whom I had neveu' seen.
I nover asked him te write to me and nover
spoke te him. Iu plain justice to him. I
may say that the letter was pretty strong,
and I disclaim any responsibility for it. According to the Toronto Mail and Empire, as
well as the Montreal Gazette that man is
an old soldier; ho is a political boss for
the Tory party in -the south riding cf the
County cf York, represented by Mr. Maclean, and ho has three sons in the army.
This fact should speak in his faveur as havin& ne intention to insult the soldiers. Ho
is himself a lieutenant in the battalion
that was comnaanded by our worthy colleagute, General Mason. When ho wrote te
me I replied saying- that his letter was
pretty streng, and asking him for references. On -March 23, 1916, ho wrote te me
saying that his letter was for publication,
and ho finished by saying this:
The hon. Senator (Mason) knows me weli

I did flot use these clippings because
they were against some soldiers, and 1 would
flot be party to reflecting on our soldiers.
If there is one soldier among a thousand
who is a black sheep I would not condemn
them ail, just as I would not condemn the
legal or medical profession as a whole
simply because there was a black sheep
among them. So you see lie is speaking
about the immigrants that, as he says, Ontario has been paying to, bring in. When
a man writes like that his statements are
entitled to some consideration. If any one
should write thus about Quebec people, 1
would say he is a man of courage, and hie
views should be given f air consideration in
order that some good may resuit.
Ail those letters were sent to me for
what? To prove the feeling that is rankling against Quebec amongst those wlio are
insulting my people, insulting those who
have opened this country to civilization
and christianity. Before using these letters I1 went further. I went toi his mnember, Mr. Maclean, .and asked him what
kind of a man this was. -He replied that
he was a âfrst-class man. I came up here
and asked my friend the senator, General
Mason, did he know Robert Hazelton, and
he replied, " Certainly, lie is a firet-c1as
man, lie is a lieutenant in my command,
and was witli me in1 the -Northwest rebellion; lie lias sons in the army." Assurning
that there was somnething wrong in hie letter, for which I amn not resp<>nsible, and
now regret that 1 read it, having been so
wrongly interpreted, 'but is there a -mati

of a correspondent? HRe also writes a
beautiful hand, sliowing that he is well
educated. Admitting that his letter contained something of which I do not approve niyself, something flot justified, about
those rejected, wlio are in general very
wrongly qualified, I was eatisfied that I
could use this letter, and on that one point
only. because in this samne letter hie says:

not a word against the Irish; not a ward
against the Welsh. As a French-man I
ouglit to have felt insulted because lie did
not make exception of the Frenchi immigrant. However, we must judge the contents of the letter .by, the -sentiment; lie
was speaking about those who had been
rejected, 75 per cent, and showing that
those men liad been reWeted because tliey
had been taken from the slums of London,
or elsewliere, and were no good. I do not
share h is sentiment on that point, but we
muet give him credit, as a man o! education and good standing in bis community for being outispoken; 1 understand lie
is the treasurer of hie township; lie lias'
fouglrt for hie country; lie has sons who
are soldiers; yet what is the treatment he
lias received from, the mob? Thank God,
the soldiers did not join the mob, but, according to tlie press report, they helped
the police to, protect him. Wlien the crowd
attacked him, lie went out of the house,
and with hie back to the wall, tried to,
make an explanation, and they refused to,
hear hîm. That is about the same treatment that I have received from the press,
with a few exceptions.
Hon. Mr. CLORAIN-You have got your

garbled report of that speech. They put in
my mouth the worst expressions from the
Hazelton letter, and attributed them to me.
They said that 1 ahused the soldiers; that
I am a traitor; that I despised those that
are enlisting for the war; and in spite of
my denial the next day from -my place

also give my answer ta a paper in Toronto
which was aaying that I would be afraid ta
go ta Toronto and repeat what I have said
here.
I sent about the same telegrani or letter
ta the Mail and ta other journals here and
alsewhere; also my letter ta the Quebec
Chronicle and niy speech. The Toronto
Globe answarad me that thay refused ta
publish my speech bacause it contained
Hazelton'a letter. 1 wrote back asking that
at least they should show their good faith
by publishing my letter ta the Quebec

Globe was this:

thing which happened in this House. I
spoke on the l2th; on the 13th I1 gave

and put the enatter right before the public.
On the l4th, alter my speech had been

amn told that he is a tin dealer in
Toronto, raised a question cf privilege ini
the House cf Commons and accused me cf
having spoken againat the soldiers and recruiting and of making accusations againat
the army, and then he said:
The senator referred te an Item which hie read
from the newspaper on whiich ho based ail bis

That was the item from the Toronto Mail;
but, instead cf eaying that, hie let it be
supposed that I was citing .perhaps from a
Liberal paper. or from a small country
paper. Why net say that what I cited was
f rom .the Toronto Mail, the organ of his
Government? Why net, as a man in his

the Gommons, and say, "I will not read

He will find that the acting minister referred to the report in the Senate Debates.

is much worse; that is my point; he referred to the Senate and he said:

press and we ail 1<11w whist hie said.
That i8 my coxnplaint. If he will not read
them I pity hlm. That is the point I made.
He referred to my speech in the Senate,
and then reading that hie said: " I take
from the press what he said, and I accuse
him cf siander." Well, I fling back to him
tihe accusation o-f being a sianderer. When
I saw the article in the press of Quebec
I sent to the Speaker of the Commons

as being a good Englishman, a glood Tory, etc.

the lSth of March. the organ of the Borden
Government, a report glving aut titis great number af men refuaed. and then. I read, on this
point alonte, the latter tramn Mr. Hazelton. Well,
how can the soldiers. whom, 1 praiaed and congratulated. take objection ta that? They have
nat been reJected, and then this dose not apply

me?
The whoie trauttie lies tn distortedl reports of what I said, and It muht have beau

Hon. Mr. GORDON-The hon. meniber
from Quebec awhile ago expressed the view
that because none of the members of this

said in bis speech of the l2th April, they
were in accord with what he said, or at
least did not disagree with him to the extent
that they wished te rise and say s0 in the

venture to assume that the members of this

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES

SECOND READING.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading o! Bill (35), An Act respectingc Investments of Life Insurance Companies' He
said: The object of this Bill is to compel
insurance companies, both Canadian and
non-Canadian, to invest a certain portion of
the increase of their net ledger assets during the years mentioned in Canadian securiies; that is, debentures, debenture stock,
bonds or other securities o! the Government
of Canada. The Bill is in the nature of a
war measure. IL proposes that these investments shall be made to the extent of
50 .per cent o! the increase of their net assets
Iduring the years 1916-17.

seems to me that even-under normal conditions it would not be an unreasonaible
tbing to say to the insurance companies
doing business in Canada that they should
be compelled to invest a certain amount of
their moneys in securities of the Dominion
of Canada. No question could possibly
arise as to the safety of such an investment.
*It ensures the safety of the insured, and it
is of manifest advantage te the Government
of Canada. It is thougbt that the adoption
of this measure will resuit in :from fifteen

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-But that is a fast
and loose Act. I amn not criticising this,
but what a splendid chance now, for the
future of Canada, to insert a provision that
these insurance cempanies shahl retain a
certain amount cf Governmnent securities for
the benefit of the shareholders. An insurance company is far different from the
ordmnary speculative. company. They corne
in and do this, that and the other, so long
as they keep within the four corners of
their charter. But we might go back te the
case o! the Mutual Reserve, where the
whole country was sacrificed, and if these
gentlemen are allowed by Parliament, and
with the consent of Uic Government, te
carry on business, for the protection cf
widows and orphanm, they.should be safeguarded, I do net care how good a company
they are, and I do not care who the
directors are. Now is a chance to insert a
clause, without opening up the question as
to the position of these insurance conipanies, whicli might alarm the public. I
thiink no harni would be done if we added
a few words as follows:
And such investments shall reniain as part ef
the securities which the comnpany will retain for

taxation so far as the purchaser is concerned even thougli the payments have

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-As long as they are

Hon. Mr. LOL'GHEED-They are made

You may cali it a detention place, an. inidustrial home, or S Teformatory, it is the

the jail and send him to the Teformatory,
or take him from the reformatory and eend
him to jail. If the local authorities riotify

this system of sending prisonere to farmne

SENATE

of about $600,000 a year. But in addition
to that, there are large sums disbursed for
nearly ail the departments in connection
with the printing and distribution of documents. I assume, therefore, that probably
the expenditure is not lesa than one million dollars a year. A large proportion of
that sum might be saved, flot only wlth-'
out loss or inconvenience ta Parliament, or
the public, but with an actual increase of
canvenience ta ¶nembers of botb Hanses
and to the public. The inconvenience to
which I refer arises from two or three
sources. Firat, there is the shipping and
packing of books and documents from the
'King's Printer's office, fraom the Parliamentary Distribution Office, and fromn Varions departments. That involves a good
deal of trouble and expense; and t.hen there
is the inconvenience arising to the parties
to whom those documents are sent.
Hon, gentlemen do not need to be told
about that. They knaw what trouble they
have trying in saine way to get rid of the
piles o! blue-books sent ta their addresses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-And the yellow
oneft
Hon. Mr. POWEÉ-The yellow ones are
the baund volumes. These are two inconveniences, and the third serious loss to the
public service is the delay in the printing
and distribution of the public statutes and
journals and other necessary documentsthings whieh should be distributed' at an
early date. Take the statutes. We meet
here and sit for three or four months and
pass a number of Acts which are supposed
to, and actually in xnast cases do* go into
operatian immediately upon -their being
assented ta by the Governaor General, or
his deputy. My. recollection does flot go
back, iany years in connection with this
partîcular subject, but I know that during
the past few years it has been, as a rule,
nearly four months after prorogation before the statutes passed during the session
are distributed ta miembers. Hon. gentlemen will see that is an inconvenience and
a serious loss to the public generally, and
liable to Iead people through the country
inadvertently ta violate the law. There is
another circumstance whîch I look upon
as beingc a serious drawback ta the present
system, that there is so much matter
printed which is unnecessary that the Government find themselves compelled to, resort to outside printing establishmnents for
the purpose ai doing work which the Printing Bureau cannot cape with. Sa far for
the inconvenience.
Hon. Mr. POWEIR.

Now with respect ta the unnecessary expense, there is, as every hon, gentleman
knows, a great deal of duplication in the
hlue-books. If any blue-book which is generally distributed contains information in
the way of statistics or otherwise, that is
enough. 1'here is no reasan why the identical information should be printed in perhapsa two or three other reports or other public documents.
Take for instance the
Trade and Navigation returns, and 'the reports of the Departinent of Trade and Commerce. Every hon, gentleman knows that
practically the reports of the Department
of Trade and Commerce enobrace everytbing
thaiM is inthe Trade and Navigation; returns.
They are almost altogether duplicates one
ai the other. The reports of the Department of Trade and Commerce are, as a
rule, somewhat fuller, but there seems ta
be no reason whatever for publishing a set
ai volumes containing -the Trade and Navigation returns. There is unnecessary duplication there. Then, if you take the report
ai the Secretary ai State and tihe 'Civil
Service Commission, bon. gentlemen will
find in the report ai the Civil Service Commission, as a sort of appendix, alI the
statutes relatîng ta the Civil Service. Thet
same information, whioh really makes a
sinali volume in itself, is ta be found ini the
repart caming froin the Secretary o! S3tate's
Department. The Civil Service List contains, as a sort a! appendux, all the statutes
affecting the Civil Service, Then there is
no abject whatever in publishing that saine
information in identically the same form
in ithe report ai the Civil -Service Commission. I know, as an explanation ai these
duplications, that there is a natural desire of the officers af any departinent ta
produce -as large and imposing reports as
possible. The idea is that a department
whieh, submits a volurninous report will
be thaugaht mare highly ai by the public,
and perhaps ta a certain extent by the
miembers of Parliarnent.
Then take the Auditor General's Report,
ta which cvery one looks for reliable and
accurate information. That repart is flot
exactly a duplicate, but it does duplicate
a large proportion ai the Public Accounts.
Ail the appropriation accounts -tvhich are
contained in the Public Accounts are also
contained in the report ai the Auditor (leneral. I think that is where they should
be found, and there is no earthly necessity for printing thein in the Public Accounts. Then there are certain other reports which, while they do not completely

APRIL 28, 1916

duplicate one another, do so to a very large
extent. The Deparfmnent of Indien Affairs
publishies quite a considerable volume riow,
aud a very large proportion of the epace
in that volume is given to the repetition
of appropriation accounts which are to be
found and which are discussed in the report of the Auditor General. The same is
true of the Postmaster General's report; he
repeats a deal oi information whieh le te
be found in thse Auditor eeneral'e Report.
The same way with the Railway Departnment; thse sanie way with the Intercolonial
Railway, and with the Telephone Statisties,
of which there je a volume; and there is a
good deel lu the Railway Report which je
a duplication of what je to be found in the
Auditor General's Report. So far for thse
duplication.
In addition to the duplication of information which should properly be set before
the public, there are publications which
are ebsolutely unnecessary. Teke thse Department of Trade and Commerce. That
departFment publiehes a yearly report. Some
tume aince it adopted the practice of publising a monthly report, and recently
thaît depertmnent lias gqne still furtiser and
publiehea weekly reporte. I have in my
hand-the lest weekly report of thse Department of Trade and Commerce. As hon, gentlemen will see, it le Iluite a respectable
pamphlet of ebout 70 pages, contaiuiug
some interesting information, but I flnd
that in thie report the minister quotes at
great length froni the gnouthly report which
was publighed for December-this je the
weekly report for Monday, 17th April. !&ow,
why should the money of this country be
spent in reproducing in this weekly report
what had alreedy -appeared in the xnonthly
report for December' No private individuel
would trausact his business in that way.
I may sey that 1 have been pleased to be
informed that action has been teken by
the Goverument ini the right direction in
regard to the matter to which I called attention lest session, or thse session before.î
I had protested against thse publication of

year, which je -a considerable itemn. The

I thought thie Gazette would be just the

think it is the duty of the Government as a
whole to put some restreint on their eebers who are doing too much lu thse way
of publiehing. Now, if this duplicetion that
I have epoken of were put an end to aud
thse unnecessary publications ivere discontinued, you would eut dowu thse present
expenditure very considerably.

would know just how many copies of each
blue-book would probebly be called for,
and the distribution offices here and et the
King's Priuter's Department, and tise other
departments would probably be relieved of

Statutes and t.he Journals of the twc
Houses and the really necessary bluebocks. I arn pleased te say that I understand the Government has been taking
soine steps tewards diminishing the abuse
which now exists, and I hope that they will
continue. 1 have some question as te the
wisdom o! the first step which I understand
has been taken, that is, the appointment
e! a gentleman who will supervise this
distribution.
It seems to me that the staff of the
King's Printer's Department, taken in
cembination. with the office of distribution
o! -documents in the Houses o! Parliament,
should be quite capable of doing that work
without appointing a new officer. I assume the new officer would find that lie
requires dear knews how many assistants.
He will be a deputy minister, or regarded
as one, and he must have a staff, and a
very large proportion o! the saving which
m.ay easily be effected will be lest in the
payment cf this officer and bis staff. It
dees seemn to me that the natural course,
the busmnesslike course would be that the
Government should devote a few liours-it would net takçe more than that-to deciding what documents should be printed
and distributed, and what ,should not, and
then te instruot the King's Printer aud the
other necessary officers how they should
act.
Hon Mr. SPROULE-The subject which
the hon. senator has drawn to our attention is one of considerable importance. 1
agree with a large part of wbat bas been
said. but with some I disagree. Oue of the
latter is iu regard te the distribution of
agricultural literature te the farmers cf
the country. He seemed te think it was cf

Hon. Mfr. DANDUBKND-No, ne.
*Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I have been eperating in that Uine for the last thirty years,
having been counected with nearly aIl the
agricultural associations in our country for

agricultur-al committee for over 27 years-Hon. Mfr. POWER-I do not object te the

it, but with regard to the usual reports
sent outHon. '-%r. POWER-I have no objection
to them.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I arn familiar with
the reports sent out by the heads of the
various farms throughout the country, because 1 had to do with them for the last
32 or 33 years.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I decidedly approve
of the distribution of these-reports.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I was going to say
that in rny judgment these are very valuable, very useful and are sought after
largely by the agricultùrists of the country. With reference to the printing, the
hon. gentleman suggests that a few members might go over these, and instruct the
department what they sheuld distribute.
That is not the method adopted by -Parliainent. The Printing Oommittee recommend the distribution of certain lines, but
one of the troublesome abuses that both
these Houses have always had to contend
with is, in rny judgment, due to the action
o! the members themmelves.
A subject cornes up, for instance, in this
House, and refers to scmething that, in
the judgment of some member, should be
printed immediately and distributed in
large numbers. He moves that the rule
which prevents that being done until it is
recommended by the Printing Com*mittee
be suspencled, and that a large edition of
the document be printed. 1 have seen that
in the Rouse of Commons over and over
again, and repeately drawn attention to
the fact that it was cultivating a very loose
habit, leading us into large expenditure,
which in rny judgment at least was in
many instances entirely unjustifiable.
Hon. '.%r. DANDURAND-Hear, hear.
Hon. 31r. SPROULE-Because lE iave

substantial amount of discontent on the

however, that the Agricultural Gazette

firet, to avoîd unneceesary expense f rom
the great number and quantity of various
publications now issued unnecessarily; and
eecondly, because of the great trouble so
many unneceesary blue-booke and double
publications give to the individual member,
who is practically deluged with them. As a
matter of fact, I do nat know what I *am
going to do with mine. I muet either refuse te take any -more, or build an addition to hause them. 1 cannot get, rid of
tbem; nobody wants them; I cannot give
them away, and they are very difficuit to
burn. They take up more coal than it is
worth while to burn themn with, so that it
is an awkward matter. Of course, there are
some publications that every member ought
to have, some unusual publications, such
as the blue-book containing the French
Treaty and. the French Convention. Aiea,
when the diplomatic correspondence in connection with the breakcng ont of this war
was published, every member wanted that.
These are mattere of great importance that

every member wants at least a copy of
anything of that kind. With regard te the

get one copy of every departmental report.
The advantage of getting it in blue-book

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-It would be 1908. I
have not got it here. It je a matter of record, howeve-r. This thing went on. The
Government under the law made this deai
with the Indians; -then they sent up surveyore te provide for the land which they
propoeed to give te, the Indians out of the
21,000 acres. That was ail plotted. The
balance of the land 'that was te be sold
for their benefit, was ail laid out. An
auction sale was called, and I want te eay
that it vwas called under the provisions of
an Order in Council passed ini the year
1894-5. 1before the Government of the day
at that ttime came into power. The saine
form, the saine mode of advertising, was
used as had been provided for in this . Order
in Council. 1 .think it was advertised in
six or eight newspapers, including newspapers ini Toronto. Winnipeg, and Portage
la Prairie, both weekly and daiiy. This land
wae advertised according te, law. The sale
was held in Selkirk aecording te law, and
before the sale was held there vas a
valuation, the came s wae used with the
school lande, put upon this by the Indian
Department. M.\r. MeLean, an oid and
trusted official of the Indian Departinent,
who had been a surveyor in that department for years and yeare, surveyed the
land, and as he surveyed each quarter
section he put a valuation on it. That
valuation 'was in -the hands cf the Department of Indian Aff airs when the land was
sold, and that v-luation was made the
upset price. If it brought that or anything
above that, well and good, they would seli.
If it did not bring that, weil and good.
The land broug-ht varjous prices, eeme of
it vwent as low as three or four dollars, and
some up t.o 10 or' 12, but the average price
cf the whole reserve, taken ali together,
was eomething like $5-60 We heur a lot

If bon. gentlemen will take the average of
land soid in ail those years, 1886 te 1908.
they will cee that the average was net much
more than the price realized at Selkirk.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Does the hon. gentleman think it fa.ir, 'witbout having told
the House the different localîties where
this land was sold, te compare land that
was soid ail over the country, remote from
large cities and towns, with land on the
main street of Winnipeg? The St. Peter
reserve is right on the main street leading
down to Winnipegl, and the difference in
the value of land in 1907 and the value of
the land soid sway back in 1885 and 1890
must be apparent te hon. gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Indian lande soid twe
years before this 'was sold did not bring
any better prices, a.nd the land was in juet
as good a locaiity, or better.' iSome of it uvas

good. School lands sold out there brought
only $5.60 the very sarne year in that sarne
locality. There was, no question ever
brought up with reference to thîs. land not
being sold at a proper value. If if had
been what had the purchasers of this land
to do with. that? The Gavernment called
a sale under the law and sold this land,
and gave the purchasers title. Every one
of these men that bouglit the land bouglit
it on a contract frer the Dominion Gevernment and reoeived a titie, and the titles
were registered under the old systesn
in Selkirk under the old registration
system.
The Torriens had flot extended
to that place. No kick was made by the
Indians or anybody else, until the member
froni Selkirk, Mr. Bradbury, for polîtical
purposes, broughlt the inatter up. Now 1 arn
geing to take up the political side of the
question. Although we do not want to talk
politics in this House, I think I can show
that it was a political proposition. Mr.
Bradbury tliought lie could get a lot of
kudos ont of it, and raised his voice i
the House of Commons and talked for four
hours, complaining that the poor Indian
had been robbed. Where does the robbery
corne in? He held up his bands in hcly
horror, and raised a row about it, and the
department said, -"If
you are not satisfied,
we will investigate it," and they sent Williams, a clerk cf the Indian Department,
and Mr. Swinburne there, and they spent
five weeks on that reserve. They were men
competent to deal with the matter and they
visited every one of the Indians. There is
not an Indian they did not talk to. The
report is too long to be placed on the Debates. They found it was a first-class business transaction, and nothing wrong with
it, and Io and behold up corne these gentlemen who bad got their patents frem the
Dominion Governrnent. They came to Winnipeg to have their patents brought under
the Torrens system. Here is a registrar
who lias no nmore te do with the Indian
Department than the man in the moon, is
flot respensible to this Government or the
Indian Department, and lie refuses to register the patents, and why? It carne eut
afterwards. It was at the dictation of the
people wlio emîployed hirn, the Roblin Governrnent, who were trying to make political
capital, and theri the Reblin Governrnent
appointed a commission to investig&ate. Is
there any provision in the British North
Amerîca Act which .-ives the local Government any power over the Indiians, outside
of British Columbia, where they have an
interest in thern? This Governrnent apHon. Mr. DAVIS.

points a commiission to investigate. Th.ree
district court judges investigate and lbwo
judges report something is wrong, and the
sale, they say, is illegal. The third judge
reports everything aIl right. I have neyer
seen the report. My hon, friend probably
has it, but I have waited to see somebody
in authority who weuld declare that the
sale was illegs.l. The Minister of Justice
of tlids country lias neyer corne dewn witli
tlie report in which lie declared tliat sale
illegal. They have some pleadings which
they submitted. to the Exchequer Court,
whicli I daimi are nothing but a farce. If
the Minister of Justice evier miade a report
tliat that surrender was illegal, up to the
present time 1 have fsiled to see it. If the
surrender was ill-egal there is flot one surrender of Indian lands for years and years
in this country tliat is net illegal, and if
title under tliat surrender is flot legal
there is net a title issued to any man in
this country under an Indian sale which is
legal at the present time. But there fa ne
proof te show that the surrender i6 illegal.
There are lots cf assertions. T-hey teck it
te the -Excliequer Court, and I have the
pleadings here. You will find by the pleadings tiiere was something said about the
officials cf the Government, but as far as
cliarging anybody wio .had bouglit land, or
anythîng of that kind, there is net a word
about it. That leads, up te the question
cf the legality o! the surrender. Mr. Swinbourne and Mr. Williams, men employed
by the Canadian Governrnent, went inte
the matter, and made a report, after a
tliorough investigation, and we -have that
report.
We have Indian officiais, men who had
been there for a long time, and everybody
in connection witli it; and 1 can read yeu
extracts froni resolutiens cf the Board of
Trade. People arounid there whce know say
that the surrender was ail rig-lt. the Indians
were perfectly satisfied until myv lion.

kudes, shoxving lie wvas a great mîan for the
Indians, and lie started aIl this trouble.
My lion. friend the leader of the Opposition

that yeu cano get Indians te sign a petition

very easy te niake thern believe that they

Government and those Indians will say
that those Indians have flot been well
treated. This matter has drifted along for
a period of eight years, and this Government has been in power for five years, yet
nothing has been done to settie this question. Those nien have been out of their
money, and -strange to say, this Goverument
bas taken their money up to the year 1914
when the last payment was made. and
neyer said to them, " This ie illegal,
and we cannot receive these payments."
They have actually gone on taking
to
1914
and
their
money
up
given receipts for that money. and
the price has been paid in full, and stili
the Government have done nothing, »r
even tried Wodo anything. It hung along
and hung along until the people in Selkirk and the surroundingc country got desperate and took this thing up. Then my
f riend, «Mr. Bradbury, saw that he had
made a huge mistake politically, that his
own political friends turned around and
in public meetings denounced him for what
hie had done. They saw nothing wrong in
the. surrender, or the sale, and that hie had
tied up this land for eight years, and
nothing was done. He imxnediately got
busy Wodo something. Then the Government to try and get out of this thing, submita it to the Exchequer Court. I have
here the pleadings. They are a thing of
beauty. I amn not going Wo put them in
the Debates, but I want Woshow my hon.
friende, more partîcularly of' the legal fraternity in this House, the number of peopie who are defendants in this case. There
are five pages of the names of people in
double columns, 500 or 600 people who are
supposed to be called upon by thé Government to corne and show cause why titles
should issue to them for this land, though
they had receîved titles, as a matter of
fact, from the Dominion Government.
Then these pleadinges go on and recite that
certain officiels of the Dominion Government had done this and done that. A certain mian by the naine o! Pedley, who
a.ppears very often in these pleadinge, had
gone up there and talked to the Indians in a
way hie should flot have talked, and a man
named Semmens hadl said something in a
way that lie should flot have said it, and
that somebody else lxad said something
else, and that those officials had misled
the Government, and therefore the Dominion Government had issued patents for
this
land,
and therefore
that 'the
whole thing should be declared off.
I

was always under the impression that if this
Government employs officiale, the Gov.arnnient is responsible for -their actions in dealing with the public. It appears to me that
that should be the case. If this Government
sends a trusted official out to make a deal
with anybody in the country, is the Government then going Worepudiate the action
o! that official? In these pleadings they
have not in any case said one word in reference Wothe purchasere o! that land; they
have never~ indicated in any manner that
the purchasere of that land had dons anything that wae wrong or corrupt in the purchase. They have said nothing at all about
the legality of the sale; they agree and
acknowledge that the sale was .properly conducted and the people bought the land in
a proper way. Then if that be the case, wby
in the name o! goodness don't they go on
and treat those pýeople decently and give
themn this land and flot try to blackmail
thern to the extent -o! s1 an acre? For that
ib what it means, a blackmail of $1 to save
Mr. Bradbury's face. I want Woshow the
position the people of that part o! the country took in regard Wothis matter. Here je

He said: This is a very short Bill and
deals with two matters, one regarding the
period of apprentices serving their time to
act as pilots in the pilotage districts o!
Quebec. The other deals with the certi&iation qualified engineers in the operaof
tion of boats run by gasolene. The présent
law as Wo apprentices works a hardehip in
many cases. It provides that they shaîl
serve seven yeare before becomingç certificated pilote. If during that period of seven
ygars they should fail for a longer *period
than four monthe to continuously serve
their apprentioeship, then they became disqualified, and no exception could be mnade.

the United Kingdamn of Great*Britain and Ireland be asked ta amend the British North
Âmerica Act noa as to provide that when the
Senate of Canada rejeote a Govermneznt Bil or

Measuýe, during two consecutive sessions of the
Canadien Parliament, the flouse of Cominons
of Canada, at the enauing session thereafter
shaîl have the power, de plein droit te pasa
and adopt sncb Bill or Measuro witbout further
reference te the Senate et Canada.

He said: This resolutian is tentative; it
is not ta be considered in enywise final,
either li ita discussion, adoption or rejection. I understand that no final or camplete solution eau' be reached or attained
in one day. or ane session, regarding either
the existence or the reform ai the Senate.
Since Confederation attacks have been made
on the BenaLe regarding its usefulness and
regarding its partisanship. These attaeks
have came from high and low quarters.
They have came frose the mont representative papers or organe of public opinion.
They have came from every plaliiormn
speaker throughout the Dominion on both
sides of politics, from the humblest ta the
lowest exponients ai public opinion. Our
Prime Ministers, Liberal and Conservative,
ln their attempt ta secure public faveur,
have denounced the Senate as a useles
bady or as a blot on democratic legielation.
I make but one exception, Bir John Macdonald. At th-at time he was mnaster of the
Sexiste. He had a majority end had no
reason to complain, but every Prime Minister in this country since Sir John Macdonald'a ime has taken pains in hlm public
utterances, bath lu the Hanse of Gommons
and on the publie platform, ta denounice
this hon. body in some way or other. That
means that the supporters ai both parties

body as being useless, superflnusu, and -a
blot on demacratie legielation. The denunciatians, the criticisms -and the sttacks
have been ertended far beyond the platiorm, the press, and the. foor of the House
ci -Commons. In view ai that condition of
things, which is permanenft and universal,
what is this hon. ¶Iouse ta do? Will the
Senate everlastingly oppose itseli tc the
will and the needs of the. people? If it attempts such a task it will fail in iLs accomplishment. 14 is better for this hon.

sornething to which. ail popular assemblies

such occasions a second Chamber becomes

Cjxarber, caîl it Senate, caîl it Council,
caîl it what you will. A second Chamber,
even if it should reject unwise rneasures
only on one occasion in a generation, could
render invaluable service to the people.
Wise, far-seeing- legisiation corning from the
popular Assernbly can afford to wait for a
brief peifiod before it is adopted; but legislation bearing the starnp of partisanship,
or hasty, ill-considered rneasures, cannot
brook interference or delay. There cornes
in the usefulness, the necessity of a second
Charnber to supervise, to check that leg-islation and give the popular Assembly tirne
and an opportunity to ascertain frorn the
country whether its stand on that measure
or that Bill has the sanction of the electors.
Now, there is nothing undernocratic in
that. Where dernocracy would be battered
and placed under the heel of oppression,
would be to have that second Chamber permanently used to defeat the will of the
people, because the axiorn is that the

why do I call the attention of the Sexiate te

country is with me li regard te this matter
-owing te a statement made by the Prime
Minister of the Dominion of Canada, a
statement which la the very upheavai of
dernocratic J>gslation in a free country.
The Prime »qýiister of this country, through
the medium of the House of Cornrons,
tells the British Empire that if Canada has
no naval force to aid in the prosecutioxi
of the war, it is due to the Senate. Now,
that ia a rernarkable statement to be made
by the Prirne Minister of this contry. ls
it true or is it not true? I arn not going to
question the veracity of the Prime Minister. He iniorrned the country that his
Governrnent could tender no naval aid to
the British Ernpire because the Senate was
determined and had decided to block ahi
legisiation towards that end. That remarkable statemnent caused rne to ponder and
wonder if this House was worth continuing.
If this honourable House is here to block
legisiation that is necessary for the wîeIfare
and the safe-guarding of the Empire, then,
hion. gentlemen, you had better vote your1 want by

information given to the Prime Minister was
false and malicieus. It wvas owing to the
,situation developed by the Prime Minister
that I gave notice of this resolution. Had
I any ;rounds upon which te base itP I
think 1 had. When Gladstone introduced
bis Reform Bis in the Imrâperia1 Parliament and they passed the House of Comnmens by a very large majority, and were
subsequently rejefled tby the House of
Lords, the saine Gladstone, te my mind the
noblest figure that ever commanded the
admiration and support cf a free people, reintroduced his measures the following
session, knowing that they would be again
rejeated by the Tory House cf Lords. That
happened te him on several occasions. It
happened te him iu bis management cf the
affairs cf the United Kingdem, on the question cf the disestablishment cf the Irish
Church. or 1 would rather call it the Dutch
Church in Ireland. It happened te him in
his famous introduction of the Home Rule
Bill in 1885-6-7. If the-Tory House cf Lords
had net hlocked that Bill 31 years ago,
there would have been ne Sinn Feins in
Ireland, and there would have been ne rebellion during the past week. But Gladstone's loyalty te the King-, and bis patriotism, his love cf humanitk', were trampled
upon by the Hcuse of Lords, with the resuit witnessed last week in Dublin. If
Gladsitene's Home Rule measure had not
been rejected by the Heuse cf Lords, Ireland would have been to-day a contented,
satisfied and presperous nation, able to take
care cf any traiter, or any rebel within its
ranks, just the samne as when the British
Parliament granted home rule te the negrees
and the Boers cf South Africa. They became the henchnien cf Britain, sending
their sons te fig-ht the battie cf the Empire,
after only seven or eight years' experience
cf home rule. If they had followed the example set te t.hein by Lord Durham in 18:378-9, when the French-Canadians teck up

Government at that tîmeHon. Mr. DANDURAND-And the Englishman as well.

hon, gentlemen will take the trouble te
look up the debate in regard te the question, in 1911, vols. 24 and 25 cf the Debates
cf the British HEouse of Oommons, and vols.
8 and 9 cf the Debates cf the Hlouse cf
Lords in Great Britain, tbey will find that
the -then Prime Minister, and still the Acting Minister of Great Britain and Ireland,
found it necessary te challenge the constitution cf the House of Lords. He feund
it necessary to appeal te the people cf Ireland! te lop off seme cf the mouldering
branches cf that institution, found it neceseary on behaîf cf the people whom he represented. and whom he wvas gcverning, te
cut the undemocratic bands of the House
cf Lords. If hon. gentlemen read these
volumes they will ne doubt find much that
is interesting in them, and a great deal oi
information. It is not my intention te
give the House a lui id dissertation on the
subject or quote documents. It is open te
every senator te get these volùmes and study
the question. Aïter introducing is Home
Rule measure in 1909-10, and its -rejection
twice by the House of Lords, hie threatened
that, if they did not pass it, be would fill
the House cf Lords witb individuae who
would bow te the will of the Government
of the day. and the Lords, these highsouled individuals, got beliind the curtain
and said, - We withdraw our opposition."
Then the Prime Minister passed a statute
whereby it is declared that when the House
cf Commons of Great Britain and Ireland
passes a Government measure or Bill which
is rejected during two consecutive sessions
by the Heuse of Lords, on the third occasion the House o.f Lords shall have ne
say in the matter, and the Bill or measure
shall be passed over their beads. The
Lords, wi*se in their generation, but lanmentably bute in yielding, accepted it. That
is the condition ef things in Great Britain,
and ail I ask by my resolution is te place
this bon. Senate on the saine basis and on
the samne footing -as the House cf Lords,
whom we have so ofren tried te imitate in

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-There are very

the principle that ail foreign companies

in the bonds of the country in which they

ofiered the public.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I shouid like te
informn the House that of the $118,000,000
cf securities deposited with the Receiver
General by the non-Canadian companies,
,only about $ 12,000,000 is not of Canadian debentures. That in itehf la the highest tribute
that can be paid te t1je securities cf Canada,
because those companies have voluntarily
purchased securities te that extent; but
there isnxo reason whatsoever why the Governiment of Canada should net insist thst a
foreigu company doiug business in Canada
and having 40 make deposit of securities
with the Government o! Canada in trust
for the policyholders, should not make that
;nvestrnenýt in the securities cf Canada. The
Canadian Governrnent at the preseut tirne
has te make a market for its securîties. As
I say, we are excluded from the English
market; we are driven practically to seiling
our securities in the United States and
Canada, and it seeins te me that if any
policy should -be supported 'by the people
of Canada. it is t.hat foreign companies doing
business in Canada should make those investments in our own debentures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I quite understand that insurance conmpanies would be
sornewhat timid te invest in 3 per cent
securities, but surely they would not to-day
hesitate to invest in Canadian securities at
5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-It is not a question iu my mind of speculation; it is an
investment really. It is not a specudation,
because if you are going to put them down
on the basis o! a speculative body, good-bye
te the insurance cornpany.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

Hon. Mr. POWER-I feel better satisfled
now, and if 'lie hion. leader of the Government had told us at the beginning what hie
has stated now with respect to the very
small proportion of the deposits in other
securities than those of Canada, L should
flot have said a word at ail.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-It
seems, to me that this Bill is a measure of
protection te the policyholders and the
sharehoelders of insurance companies. Under
the existing law, foreign companies have to
make a deposit with the Governrnent of a
certain arnount before .they can commence
business. If I understand 4this Bill it goes
further, requiring them to invest a portion
of their actual bona, fide earnings in Canada
in Goverrnent securities. 'I thin¶<- that is
admirable protection, particularly for the
policyholders and shareholders. At present
there is over a million dollars earned in
Canada every year, profits upon which go te
the United States or other places for investments by the foreign companies, and if you
can compel them, as I understand this law
does, 'to inveat a portion of those profits in
Canadian Government securities, it is an
admirable rneaoure for the benefit of the
country that has te raise the enormous
amount of rnoney we need a.t present. Frorn
what little experience I have had in life
insurance companies, I amn quite sure that
any oue who has been behind the counter
for any length of time wvil1 corne te the
conclusion that it is safer for the policyholder and also for the sharehokiers if the
cornpany invests its profits in à per cýent
debentures of the Domninion, rather thlan
in stocks of different kinds and different
varieties which are eubject to fluctuation
and the ups and downs of the miarket.
There are companies, as has been pointed
out by rny hion. friend from Rothesay (Hon.
.Mx. Domville), whose managers are inclined to -ie speculative. and do not confine thenselves in making investinents of
the surplus ýfunds of the conipany to proper
and legitimate investnieits. The resuit is
that they invest in certain stocks, and the

that Ontario bas been more progressive in

particularly to review the legislation whicb

Board. We therefore have two bodies pronouncing upon the saine question. It is
almost unnecessary to say that it is impos4

after proper advertiseiment that they were

the commiseion in that case had ta say

is quit. as competent ta decide that when
the matter cornes up as the Railway Commission is. I think the hon. leader af the
Government said that the board would review aur legislation. It appears ta me that
that is pretty strong-ta have the Railway
Commission sitting over here reviewing tb.
legisiation of Parliarnent. I take the re-

verse view. I say that if those gentlemen
want ta make a report we wîll review the
report, and if we find it Is right we will
adopt it, but if not w. will reject it; but
surely we are not ta be asked ta hand over
ta the Railway Commission the power ta

that is what it means, pure and simple, and

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-To
what ertent is power given under this Bill
ta the Railway Commission that is nat now
vested in tihe Minuster of Railways?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-The power given
under clauses 7 and 8 are flot given under
the sections of the Railway Act.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
saine power that ie given ta the Board of
Commissioners is now vested in the Minister of Railways, the only difference being
that the Minister of Railways iÀsa member

Hon. Mr. DAVIS: H. is one of us; hie is
one of the Government.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-He
may be one of us just now, but not one of
you, that is the only difference. However,
that is apart from the point I rais.. I took
the samne view strongly that my bon. friend
did at finIt, because it was represented ta
mce Ihat il was placing power in the board
Ihat really and praperlY belonged ta and
was vested in Parliament; but I find on
reading clause 127 of the (-onsolidated
Railway Act that tbe saine po-wer that it
la now proposed ta vest in the Railway
Board is vested in the Minister of Railways.
If hie should disapprove, as the board might
disapprove, of course, lie would b. responsible ta his colleagues and ta Parliament;
but it does not take power froin Parliament
ta deal with the question at any timne, no
matter what they may do.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I think there i
very little discussion of a matter af this importance ta the House.
It changes the
whole principle of railway legisiation that

One of the leading bankers in New York
said to me over a year ago that the gr-%t
'difficulty in Canada to-day is its duplication of great trunk lines. He said the most
advisable step that the Governsnent of Canada could take to-day would be to pull up
the rails of one of its transcontinental systeins, and forget ail about the fact that it
ever was buiît, or that the Government of
Canada had eventuially to pay for il. Now
is Parliament the proper tribunal to conaita

which we grant charters annually should be

roads? The solicitor will appear before us

varjous steps which have been taken by
the different provinces of the Dominion,
and those stops, which have been crystallized into provincial legisiation, have been
entirely supported by public sentiment.
That public sentiment has been very largely. if net altogether, the resuit cf the education of the publie as to the evils of intemperance. It has been the outeome very

arisen in connection with the very lamentable and calamitous war which is now being

perance legialatien can look back te
the time when what was known as
the license system. posaessed a latitude
whioh almoat deprived it of the element cf
restriction, aud permitted aknost free trade
in liquor. The whole trend of legislation in
the provinces has bee.n along the lines cf
restricting the license eystem in the traffic
of liquor. It lias resulted ini the aliridgment
cf the heurs when liquor might be sold; as
te the accommodation which should be furnished by those who engage in the traffic;
as te the number of licenses which should
be issued by the varieus authorities in the
different municipalities throughout -the
Dominion ef Canada; in the increase cf the,
license tees which should be paid te the
provincial authorities or te the municipal
autharities as the case might be. Then,
marching along with this particular class of
legisiation, we have other legisiatian upon
the statute books of the Dominion cf Canada. known as the Canada Temperance Act,
which is along the line cf total prohibition
in s'uch localities as may by popular vote
adopt prohibition. Ba that we find upon the
Provinc ial Statute Books as welil as upon
the Dominion Statute Book co-operation and
more or less co-ardination along the lines of
restrictlng the liquor traffie. Sanie years
aga, shortly aiter the late Government came
into office, publie opinion demanded that a
plebiscite should be submitted to the people
of -Canada upon this very important subject. The plebiscite was taken, and there
was a majority vote in favour of the Dominion of Canada enacting a Dominion prohibitory law, but it was feit at the time that
public sentiment had net been sufficiently

was then taken, to warrant the Government

That, hon. gentlemen, is
the principle of the Bill. Inasmuch as it
will involve probably lengthy discussion
and will go before a Comriýittee of the
Whole, it is unnewcessary for me to diecuas
the details of the measure except to say
that the principle is a very desirable one,
and 1 have no doubt will be adopted.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-This is a very desirable Bill noa doubt, but is the Government quite sure that it is not opposed to
the section of the British North America
Act which prevents restriction of trade between one province and another? It seems
to me the constitution was framed for that
very purpose mainly. I should like to ask
the Government whether it would flot be
necessary to amend the British North
If
America Act to permit this restriction.
you can restrict trade between the provinces in one article, you can do it for another.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I would say that
that is a consideration that has flot -been
overlooked. The Government would not
have brought down legisiation to this Parliament if they hati not known that they
had authority to do so. 1 hope my hon.
friend will not feel in the Ieast disturbed
in regard to the constitutionality cf this
measure. 1 may assure him that it has received the best conaideration cf the law
officers of the Department cf Justice. The
varieus judgments of the Privy Council
have been well considered and have been
applied in the consideration of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I should like ta say a
few words on the second reading of this
Bill. 1 may state in the first place that I
arn opposed ta the Bill in toto, and that 1
think it my duty, as an advocate c f what
I look upon as reasonable legisiation, ta
pratest against the introduction of this
measure. The lion. gentleman, whose introduction cf the measure is quite beyond
criticisrn, told us that this prohibition sentiment was extending rapidly bath in Europe
and in America. Now, it is a fact, hion.
gentlemen, that during the last few years
there has been a sort cf epidemic cf this
prohibition sentiment, or the desire for
prohibîtory legislation, running over a great
portion of the United States and the greater
part cf Canada. It is something like influenza; it cames and it is very violent
for awhile, it does net do any good, and
then it passes away.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHED

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Do you think
there is any anti-taxin for it?
Hon. Mr. POWER-Yes, there are certain
remedies, one cf which was well kncwn a
few years ago, called Peruna, which contained I think 40 per cent of alcohol. That
is the sort cf remedy whîch is mcst generally applied. This epidemic, as I sa', has
included the greater part cf Canada in its
sweep. There is no question about the
vote. The difficulty is that this prohibitory
legisiation really does not, as a rule, meet
with the honest approval cf the bulk cf the
people in the different provinces, and the
reasons are these: that nowadays, for a
great many years, the tendency bas grown
ta look upon drunkenness as a very ohjectionable thing.
There was a time, a
hundred years ago, when great leaders in
public if e and in private life did net think
it discreditable ta wind up a dinner under
the table. That condition cf things passed
away with the advance cf wisdoni and
civilization, and as a resuit cf the strenueus efforts of friends cf temperance, who
resorted ta moral suasion. Now, I have
undertaken to say that the public sentiment cf this country is not at all as unanimous in faveur cf this kind of legishation
as one might suppose. The truth is, hion.
gentlemen, that those who are conscienti'ously opposed to prohibition are afraid,
when it cornes ta a vote, ta voice their sentiThat perhaps
ments through their votes.
seems a rather sweeping statement and a
little rash, but if hon. gentlemen would
stop ta consider, I think they %vould see
that it is not se. In the first place, as I
intimated a few minutes ago, drinking is
now unfashionable. No man wishes te be
either looked upon as a drunkard or a man
who often loses central cf himself through
drink. He does net wish te be looked upon
as in favor cf liquer, because if lie veted
against a prohibitory nieasure it w-ould be
clainied that hie would be votinga in favor of
liquor and drunkenness, ai-d there is this
feature about the case ta whichi I think hion.
gentlemien rnay nat have given suifficient
attention-there are two classes of people
who have been very pranîinent in urg-ing the
passing of these drastic mieasures in favor
of preventing the use of liquor. One class
is wornen. Low, one can readily understand women's dislike cf drink. They hate
ta think that their husbands or sons are
drinkingý any kind of iintoxicating liquor
and thereby perhaps running the risk cf
becomning habitual drunkards, or excessive
drinkers, and the prohibitionist comps ta

period, wine and other intoxicating beverages -have been used throughout almost
the whole known world. and no question
was ever raised as to the propriety of using
thema. No attempt was ever made to prevent the drinking of wine. Take countries
like Italy, Spaini and Greece; wine has been
consumed there fromn time immemorial. It
has done, as far as I amn aware, no harm,
and no Goverriment in any of those countries would undertake to prevent ita use.
In northern countries there has been more
abuse perhaps of the liberty of drinking,
and just because in England, and Ruasia
and Bcandinavia, the right to drink has
been abused, efforts have been made, particularly during the last century, to prevent drunkenness. Amongst tho'se whose
efforts to put an end to the abuse of wine
and liquors had a great effect on ,public
conduct, and publie sentiment, I may mention Wesley, and Whitfield, and in Ireland,
Father Matthew. Very valuable work was
done by the people who trusted to moral
suasion. As far as I understand. there was
no corisiderable movemnent in favour of pronibition until about the middle of the last
century. About that time I think the Maine
prohibitory law was passed, and aince that
time prohibitory laws have bee-i passed in
a great many states of the union. This prohibitory legislation has to a large extent
taken the place of appeals t,- religious and
moral sentiment and to self-respect, and I
think thst the cause of temperance has flot
benefited by the chanire. If moral suasion
had been continued there would have been
less drinking than there is to-day. lesu
drunkenness and a great deal more selfrespect and more respect for the law.
I propose ta say a few words about this
respect for the law, but there are a couple
'ýf points I think worth mentioning before
cznie to that. Canada, is not a drunken
1ùuntry. When you find a wide-'spread
tnovement in favour of a certain kind of
tagisîstion, you naturally ask - Well, why
Now if Canada were a

drunken country. 1 could understand that
there was seine solid foundation for the prohibitory sentimnent, but Canada is flot a
drunken country. The statistics show that
the consuimption of alcohol per tapita is
less than in almost any other civilized
country. It is much leas than in England
and the United St.ates. I think it is only
about one-fourth what it is, in England.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-How about coffee?'
Hon. Mr. POWER-I do not think coffee
affects the nerves so much. While nu douht
it is a bad thing to drin-k intoxîcating
liquor ta excess, it is aise a bad and sinful
thing to eat too much; and I venture ta
say that eating too muoh and eating the
wrong things do as much miachief as drinkirig. Wtiy do not the .same public-spirited
men start an agitation te limit the 'amounit

cf the things they shahl eat? Why is there
ne campaigri against the use of tea? I said
j nat now that I have a word to eay about
dis.respect for the law. I have not taken
time te prepare 'this speech, and I propose
te refer te a pamphlet. The writer of this
document, the laite Edward Miail, was one
of the ablest public servants we ever had in
Canada. Sooesking of the Scott Act he said .

far we can justify the hypocrites-for they
are nothing Ibut hypocrites as -far as 1
know, in my province-in their policy. 1
let al the otiher provinces go in'this question of liquor and consumption. Now I
have oniy given -my views. They may quote
thein alI, for I have no hours cf weakness
about me; I do not care; I arn fot
seeking for votes, not seeking for party
advantage.
Since I have been ini
this Cliamber' I think I have shown
an independent spirit standing up for what
I thought was right aIl round. Nothing
wouid take me te the party standpoint or
permit me te do anything radicafly wrong
and that could mot be sustained. before the
country. We are here as judges, not as partisans. It is our duty te do what je right.
and te give the Government credit when
they do what je right. I arn sonry that t:he
Gevernment has had to bring in this Bill.
1 suppose it has been forced upen them, but
I do appeal te the hon. gentleman here irrespective cf the outside view, irrespective of
sentiment, irrespective cf what the women
uay at home-morne of them have wivs-irrespective of ail that te do justice. The
Iaws should be regulated cf course as te
high license, that reste with the local Gevernments, aise the quality cf the stuff the,
licensed lieu-ses ei, inspection, and se on,
but 1 want the members cf this House te
stand up as a body and show the worid that
the Senate declines te be led by preachers
and women -te do something that is inrational and sumptuary.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Section 121 cf the
British North America Act says:
Ail articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall. from
and after the Union, be admitted free into each
of the other provinces.

Now I amn in faveur of an'y measure that is
goed fer temperance, but if the Government
is really anxieus te have this measure
carried jute effect the sooner we make this
peint clear the better. I arn informed that
this legislation is ultra vires of the powers
cf the Dominion Government. Here you are
saying te eue province who has ne prohibition te-day "You snali net do a certain
thing; you shall net"Hon. -Mr. LOUGHEED-No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Wel], you cannot
ship liquor te another province: consequently the residents cf that particular province

are told by this Government. -You. cannot
do a certain thing.e' If to-day you are in a
position te say te a province. "Yen. shall net
ship ino Ontario," for instance, "certain
articles," to-morrow tis Government could
say, "You shail net ship another artile." I
have been tOld by a legai gentleman that
this Bill is absolutely agamest the Confederatien pact; that free intercourse was te exist
after Confederation between. the different
provinces, with nothing te interfere, and
that therefore tbis legialation je in violation
of that pact. Just ncw the leaders cf the
Governrnent tell n that the lawyers cf the
Gcvernment have looked inte this very
carefully and that we need have ne fear.
Well, I recail full weli that en the question
of liquor legislatien ne leas a Government
than that of Sir John A. Macdonald passed
a license law restricting trade and commerce
and if I recolleet rightly that law was declared unconstituticmal. I remember several
Iaws that w-ere passed by this Goverument
that were eubsequently declared unconstitutional when tliey were conteiiding against
the Government of the late Sir Oliver Mowat
-- the Streans .Act and other Bills.. Bo the
fact that the opinion of the iaw officers. cf
this Government was sought, is net
concluive. I heard Sir Richard Cartwright
in this House aay that smm legal. gentleman of very higli standing had given an
opinion, which waemo exactly the opinion
tihat lied been wanted, and lie immediatcly
said, - I have given you very mtrong .reason why this should ha that way, but if I
were told te do se I could give you equally
strong reasone why it mhc-uld be Iii, other
way." Se if the officers of the Orown were
asked il thi Bill shouhd ha passed lhey
could give ail the. strong reasons why it waa
constitutional; but te mnake the, matter absolutely sure, a smaîl amendient could be
made te the British North America Act s0
that there could ha no doubt about it by
simply saying that trade in alcdooic
liquers. could, by thjs Act, ha restricted between province and piovince or the province inter se. There would ha ne objection
te that, but as AiL te-day,' it wiih ha put
j
on the statute bock, somebody will take
eut an injunction, or it will ha refcrred te
Engiand, and you wiil hear no more about
it, for the decision on these appeals te the
Privy Council cornes when aIl intereet in
the matter lias passed. We may get lb.

probability is thlat ilt will ha that the law
je net constitutionai.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The leader of the
Governmneft said a very important thîng
when introducing this Bili-that its sole
object wvas to prevent the importation froin
a non-probibitiofl province into a prohibition province. Do I understand the hon.
leader to have stated correctly and fully
the objeet of thie Bill?

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I was assuming
that the fion. gentleman could read the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CLORÂN-I teck the statement cf the leader cf the <lovernment that
the sole. object cf the Bill was te prevent
importation from one province te the other.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-It seems te me we
have listened te smre long speeches ibis
afternoon on the question cf prohibition
but from my standpemnt the question cf prohibition is net involved in this Bill.. The
question is simply tbis: If one province cf
Canada desires to exercise its rîghts se far
as the prevention cf tbe sale cf liquor within the province is concerned, the provision
is that the bordering province shahl net
joîn in defeating the objects wvhich the
people cf that province have in view. That
is the mole object cf the Bill. Se far as
importation from a foreign country is concerned , it is within the province of the
Dominion Government te binder it. Legislation is net here required, because that
question is purely within the jurisdictioncf the Dominion Government, and they
can do it any trne.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes.
Hon. Mr. CLORÂN-Then 1 say the Bill
is one-sided; it bas only ,got, one leg to
stand on. If importation is to be restricted
simply f rom the nonprohibition provuncee
in'to the prcohibitien province, then what
about importation from the states of Mainie,
Vermont, Illinois, Wyoming and Dakota,
and from England, Scotiand, Ireland,
France, and ail the countries cf Europe?
Cari wines and liquors be imnported fron

of being used privately by individumîs. In
that way I understand this legislation is
aimply supplementmry te the legisiation that
the provinces £hose te enact, and it enables
thern te evercome a difficulty which they
have found te be a very sericua one for a
considerable time. There is no doubt that
just now there is a great temperance wmave
geing over Canada, and especially I think
in the West there is a decided feeling that
soxnething has.te be done te prevent the
abuse cf liquor. By allowing the people cf
the provinces themselves te deal with this
whole question, and enmbling them te make
their legisiation thoroughly effective, the
Goverument are taking the right step, sc
far as the principle of the Bill is concerned.
Possibly when we go inte Conimittee sme
questions may arise as te the actual wording
of Bill that should be criticised. Some cf
the clauses are very drmstic, snd my hon.
f.riend did net in any wmy discuss the actal
details cf the measure. I therefore shal
net take them up at the present time, but
when we go inte Comrnittee cf the Whole,
r hope we shall have a very full-discussion
of thern, as I understand eny hon. friend
that'.this legisîstion
fromn Halifax te .ay
will prohibit the use cf wine Lu the .provvinces, 'but as 1 tried te point eut, I do net
Luterpret the Act Lu that way. I think
the difficulties that hie pointed eut do net
arise under the Bill. I therefore do net see
rny way te supporting the amendement
moved by my hon. friend frorn Halifax.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-If this were a
prohibition Bill, I would net hesitate te
vote agminst it, because I do net believe
in prohibition; I do net think we can effect
it Lu an>' province; but as this #Bill is only
te help the provinces which want prohibition to make their legislation effective,
I think there is ne harm in voting for it
and let the Bill go te the Committee, but
certainl>' clauses 4 and 5 are tee severe.
There are many who de net believe in prohibition for thernselves who will vote for
prohibition for othera. I have heard people
make speeches for prohibition for others,
but they aay, "Net for myself; I can take
care cf myself; I amn speaking fer others".
If everybody teck that view we would net
want any prohibitory 1mw; I hava my greà.t
doubt whether this law can be passed b>'
this Parliament. The point raised b>' the
hon. anember for De Lanatîdière (Mir. Cmsgrain) based on section 121 of the British
North Amerîcan Act is ver>' serieus, and
if I remember well I thin< the Hon. UMr.
Doherty himself said te the House that
S-26
REYIUEM

he is doubtful if this Bill can be passed
under the constitution-I think I saw that
in the pres and even in Hansard. I suppose that question wiil be raised by lawyers
am soon as the law cornes into force, so I
arn willing to vote for the second reading,
because it is not a prohibition Bill, and
because in Committee we may amend some
of the.clauses which I think are too severe.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS: I was rather amused
by the speech of the hon. gentleman who
has just taken his seat. He is opposed
te prohibition, but he is quite willing te
put it on somebody else. He has been
talking uibout protecting minorities, and I
arn aware that there is quite a respectable
minooeity Lu every one of those provinces
opposed to legisiation of this kind, stiil
they are te be handed over to the wolves
because it does not concern a certain gentleman who knows hie is not going to be
He says,
affected ini hie own province.
"«Ail right, you can do as you like, it is
not going te affect us". That sort of logic
does not appeal te me. However, I want
te say that I arn going te support the
arnendment, sirnply because 1 have a gcod
deal cf experience in the workings of prohibition myself. I have had prohibition
up in my country. When 1 went there
nrnaway back in 1880 we had the m
gent prohibitory laws that you can imagine.
We had a big force cf mounted police to
try to, enforce the 1mw, and what developed'
Whisky peddlers and boot-leggers. A pa-rty
brought a coffin into the country and was
supposed to be bùrying his aun-t, but te
ooffin was full cf alcohol. The coffin 'was
filled with stones and buried, -and the
whisky which it had contained was sold
ail through 'the district. We had whisky'
stilis ail over the country, from .1880 te
1885, un-til the people got sibsolutely disgus-ted with the whole business and went
back to the license system. It is true this
is not a prohibitive measure, it is merely
giving- the provinces the right to enforce
prohibition within, -their owN; borders. I
might say from our standpoint ln Saskatchewan it 'will corne in very handy.
We have a systern of our own there. We
have flot passed mny prohibitory law; the
Government -simply mbolished the bar, and
the wholesale houses, mnd took over the
business, mnd are running it themselves.
They have been interfered with by outside
competition from Manitoba and elsewhere.

but outside of that restriction the powers
are complete and the DomInion. Parliament
bas the right to paso any law for the good
government of the country, or on any mubject whatever except sucli pavera as are
speciaily deiegated te the local legisiatures.
Bo that 1 do nlot think there need be any
apprehension as te the power of th.s Parliament to pas Ibis legiaiation. I quite
agrea with the hon. gentleman from Ottawa
ini the statement which he lias made that
the present Bill does nlot involve the queetion of prohibition. It.involv« merely the
question as Io whether the power of the
legisiature, being limnited as te !ts under
tho British North America Adt, and the
province being unable te guard itaell from
the danger %batmay arise through the importation of liquor li the province wibliout~ the consent of the province, the. Federal
Parliament ahould coma te lhefr help, i
ordar te protect or extend, s tu apeak, the
.aulonomy of t1he provinoe.
Let us conaider the question li this liglit; supposing
thaI instead of having the eos2faderation
-as vo have it, that we had only a Faderai
Yarliament, with ail the legislative power
vested i that Parliament.
It .would be
open to the Faderai Parliamant to provide
lor the -vote being lakan in any of the
provinces, and te ascertain whether in snob
provinces liera 'would b. a maj'ority againat
or ini favour nf prohibition, wauld it be
umreaasonabie or would it b. reasonable for
the Parliament ta enact a Iaw similar ta
tbis one li order te prevent the importatien from one province te the other? This
cannot b. don. by a province under the
division of authority. It can only b. done
by the Federai Parlaument. The principle of this intervention is nlot a new
thing at ail. W. have it in the Ternperanc. Act.
Under Ahe Temperan-ee Act
Ait 8 provided -thatNo persan shall, except as iln tbis part speially provlded. by himself, hie cierk, servant
or agent, shlp, bring or carry or cause to be
shipped, brought or carrieci ta or into an>'
such county or clty any Intaxlcatlng liquor.

Therefore iinder the Canada Tamperance
.Act it is open ta any electoral district or
any cou.nty te prohibit the sale of liquor
vithin the territory, and the moment pro.hibition is adopted by a popular vote then
it is illegal, under the Faderai Act, 10 ship

.Act, instead of dealing as th. Temperance
Act did, marely, with districts in the province, dcal. with the vhole province.
Therefare the principle is the saea, and
the principle already exista in the. Canada

I therefore submit itlai
but reasonable and in harmony with provincial au10nomy, Ihat when the people

try in Ibis country a middle course. I
would favour the prohibition of strong aicoholic beverages, but would allow the
people in this country t0 use liglit wines
and liglit beer containing a small proportion af alcohol, four or live per cent. My
impression is that it would be worth trying in a country such as ours. I know of
countries which are in aur latitude, but 1
con! cas àre in a more lemperate zone,
France, for instance, whcre absinthe, which
is the beverage that people vho are bard
drinkers use, lias lately been probibited,
but it would neyer enter the mind of France
ta prohibit the use of wine and beer. Prohibition, I repeat, ia not thc question which
is involved in the present Bill. It lias
simpiy for ils object the strengthening of

and to that extent I favour the policy
which this Bill has in view. Neverthelees

me that there are two p'rinciples contained

Clause 4 ptcivides that the off ender eummoned before a.court for having violated

je a very dangerous one, and I will ask this

population of Canada of about 7,000,000,
which is very nearly the correct number, I
find that the foreign born amount to a million and-,a quarter. Born in lthe United
Kingdom about a million, that would leave
five millions. I divide that into two parts,
the French Canadian born two millions, and
the English Canadian bom about three
millions. Then I have the exact figures of al
the single and married men of military
age in Canada, divided in the way I stated
into those three classes, or I gmight say
four classes. There is no doubt about the
exact figures regardmng the United Kingdom
born and foreign born. They are given in
the census return. 1 have te estimate the
divisions and divide as near as I can the
remainder, consisting of English born and
French born. 1 estimate the French born
as being two-filths of lthe five millions and
the remaining three-fifths English born.

Mr. Westren also states that the record
of accidents in his factory shows three
times as many casualties ini any given
time, as occurred during a simil&~ time
before the war, simply due to the necessity
of constantly breaking in new labour on
processes that are more or less hazardons.
This of course will mean an increased burden to carry the cost of workmen's comnpensation insurance.

The Hamilton Recrulting League humbiy
begs the Government of Canada to, appoint a
Commission for tih. purpose of:(a) Taklng a census of all mon in the Dominion from 18 yeara of age and upward, specifying those married and unmarried.
(b) Classifying the men accordlng to thelr

le urged with a view to, the immediate application of some just and comprehenaive system of

readlly secured.
WVith regard ta the prospects it ia hardly
necessary for me to marko any referenco ta
th-at subjoct because the information is
public. Everybody has the information in
regard ta the war situation, but I think I

niight safely say that it affects different
people in different ways. If a man has an
interest in the war, or a relative at the
front, or if it interferes with his business
either profitably or the reverse, ho takes
more note cf what is geing on.
If none of those conditions apply ta that
man, his intorest is less keen, ho is more

or Iess indifferent, and he does not realize,
perhaps, as much as the other man the
necessity of prosecuting and using every
possible means of bringing the war to its
proper conclusion; so that what 1 amn saying may not have the effect that I should
like to ase produced, but 1 hope it may. I
think it is pretty well understood that the
plan of registration adopted, in England
waa à very extensive one; every ono of
both sexes from 15 ta 65 was registerod. so
that from the returne in the hands of the
authorities they were familiar with the ago,
condition and occupation of ail inhabitants
of- both sexes of thoso agos. What I would
propose for Canada would simply be a
registration of ail mnen of military age, from
18 to, 45, and have thom divided into classes
s0 that mon wouid ho ciassified aocording
to their ability to serve at the front, or the
necossity for them remaining at home for
war purposes or other purposes of the contry. I would not go es far as thoy have
gone in England, because that is both expensive and extensive, more so I think
than was nocessary; but I would liko to
ses registration adopted &long the Unes I
have just stated. The effeet woiild be. as

SENATE

I cite this language just te ehow how unfair the press, and even sorne rnen in this
House, are te, a iienator who had the courage to state f acts, which, coming f roin men
of another nationality are taken as true. It
does not make much di.fference te me. 1
despise these elanderous attacks, but as a
public -man I have a right to resent it. If a
senater cannot place his views before the
Senate without being abused even if these
vie-ws may not be agreeable te some of them,
it is a dangerous situation, and i't ia time
we knew where we stand. We know that
in Ontario especially the French Canadians
have been abused for not furnishing their
quota of men te the front. I have an
answer te that. If you take the rnorning
papers giving the casualties, the names of
those killed or wounded, what do we find?

not like so-me others, have been sent to
the front, and kept at the front to, fight and
die. But I go further. I have in rny ha'id
hear the certificate of the head of the arrny
of this country, Sir Sam Hughes, who said
ir England on the 21st Marvh, according to
a despatch which appeared in the Citizen
of the 22nd of March:
The general w"asaked If the bilingual dispute had haxnpered recruiting In Quebec and
Ontario.
*'No," he replied, "I know of no dispute.
I amn perfectly satisfied w1th the way Prench
Canadians have responded."

I take this occasion te put this certificate
in the Debates as the rnost complete answer to these sianderers in Ontario and
elsewhiere, who are abusing- the province of
Quebec and French <Janadians in particular.
I wish te be fair te everybody. 1 have received hundreda of complirnentary letters
from places in Ontario--Oakville, Brighton
and other towns, different people in Ontario--congratulating me, and saying I was
rizht about saying to stop recruiting for
the present and protesting against the great
and use]ess expenses. I do not dare to
give their namnes, because now a citizen who

But
they
all say:
We congratulate

by the banks who are trying- to impose upon

parts about the statement of the Mail and
Empire that in battalions 75 per cent and
50 per cent of the applicants are refused; my
hon. friend has admitted that 50 per cent
are rejected. I have received a statement
frorn Earlscourt, a place near Toronto, I
think, saying that in recruiting 1,400 troops
only 65 were rejected. I tbink that is the
greatest compliment to, those gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-That la Irish.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Weill, they are
just as good as if they were French. I amn
willing and desirous to give full credit to
those men before the House, but again I
ask why, when the facts I have stibmitted
are flot as strong as those cited by other
people, 1 arn abused. There i8 no use trying to stop a man from speaking his mind
when he mnust do so in the publie interest.
Truth must corne out sorne day.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-When I see
tacts which, as a public man, I should
speak of, even as against my leader, I arn
sorry to be reproached by him for not sharing his views. Anyhow, we are here to state
our minda, and wben a man. does so frankly
and honeatly, as I have done, I do not see
why hé should be abused. I take this oqýcasion to congratulate my hon. friend for
having .brought up his motion. At a tirne
like this it required courage on bis part
to corne alter me and endorse me indirectly
as he did. On the other hand, I ask rny
lion. friend, and 1 ask the gentlemen
present, why I arn abused as having spoken
against the soldiers when I have not said a
word against thern; on the contrary, having
always prsisesd them. I have said enolugh
to put me righth before the public, before
the soldiers and before rny friends, and I
hope to put myseif right before this hon.
House, because if there is one thing that
would pain mie more than another it would
be to lose the respect of this House by
rnaking- statements Vo hurt any man, either
in this House or outside this Housme. On
the otiier hand, if 1 have hurt anv one, it
was doue as a matter of duty, and I hope
that froni to-day those that have accused
nie here will take my word and accept these
declaratioîs in justice Vo me.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-The notice of inquiry
wvlich we have before us, which has been
introduced by the lion. senator froni Toronto, refers to a very important subject,
one that lias not been very rnuch mentioned

MAY 4, 1916

so far in the speeches that have been made,
or by the hon, gentlemen who introduced
the inquiry. The important subject is registration as an aid to recruiting. With regard
to what might be called the preamble of this
notice of inquiry, I cannot say that some of
it at ail events has muai bearing on the
subject of registration. For instance, the
hon. meinber says that:
--of the men who are offerlng themoelves for
enllatment a large proportion ls rejected for
phyalcal z'easons, thus entallng much unnecessary trouble and expense,.
But hie lias flot s9hown us in any way bow
the systemi of registration is going to lessen.
either the trouble, the expense, the number of rejections that t'ake place in those
who offer themselves for enlistment.
I.
cannot for the lie of me see how a system of registration would either lessen the
trouble of the examining officers or the
expense of paying them. With regard ta
the examination of recruits, I know smrething about it personally, h-aving been for a
great number of years a medical officer in
the Militia, and having had these medical
regalations ta carry out and put into
eflect, and 1 can ay that the examination
of recruits for the army is a most severe
one. 1 also make this statement, that there
are rnany men accepted by lite insurance
companies as risks who could not begin to
paso the examination for admission inta
the army; and I make that statement without casting any reflection whatever on the
clasa of persons who are examined and
accepted for lite insurance. We ail know
that there are many cases rejected for
armny lite that would be accepted for ordinary lite insurance. When we consider the
great number of men rejected, mnany of
themn for sliglit alments, we know that
there are men coming up for enlistment
and for examination, who have been examined and rejected over and over again.
When I was in St. John the last time I went
into a recruiting office and was there while
a young man was being examined. He was
rejected because bis sight was defective. He
was a 6trong, hearty, able man of military
age,-able in every other way, but defective as far as his sight was concerned. He
could not, therefore, be ciassed as among
the maimed, the diseased or the deformed.
Many of them have been rejected for defective téeth, for defective hearing, for other
slight ailments, over-lapping toes, things
of that kind, ail of them objections that
wouid not disqualify themn from being accepted by if e insurance companies. Therefore, so far as registration is concerned, 1
S-27

do flot think that that portion of the preamble wouid be remedied in the slightest
degree. In regard ta another matter referred. ta. the interfering with the industries
of the country by taking out men who ought
ta be lef t behind, registration might have
some effeat; but my own view of registration
is that unlesa it is used as a preliminary
and a forerunner of compulsory service it
is no good.
Hon. Mr. POWEB-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DÂNIEL-That lias been proved
by the experience already lad in the Old
Country. There registration was tried out
fully, and was really very muccesaful, as I
understand fromn the remarks of my hion.
friend who introduced this inquiry, for
out of 5 million men who were amenable
for service, no leas than tbree million offered
through this registration. That is a larger
number than I would have anticipated.
But even so, the authorities in the Old
Country have found themselvea compelled
in the end ta rebort ta compulsory service.
My idea of compulaory service is that it
flot only saves time .where time is
one of thec most important elements
of the whole matter, but it is the
fairest to ail concerned
It does flot
allow the elackter ta conceal himself.
and it does flot put the whole burden
on the young -man wio is willing and
feels it bis duty ta go to the front, and
who is impressed with the importance and
responsibility of bis citizenship. It does
not compel the very best men that we have
ta take Up the whole burden; but if we had
compulsory service -ail would be treated
alike, ail on th«le saine level, and every individual would be made to feel bis own individual responsibility for the safety and
defence of the state. So, unless this legislation referred ta is as a prelîminary only
for compulsory service, 1 think if would
hardly be worth the trouble and expense
it would involve. But if it is a necessary
part of a systemi of compulsory service, 1
for one shahl support it most heartily.
Hon. Mr. POWVER-I agree with most of
wliat the hon, gentleman of St. John lias
said, and 1 quite agree in what lie lias said
witli respect to the proposai of the lion. and
gallant member from Toronto with respect
ta registration. I think that registration,
if it comes at ail, should come as a preliminary or acconipaniment of legislation for
conîpulsory service. WVlatever any one of
us may think as ta compulsory service, I do

REVISEO EDMTON

SENATE

not think that either party in this country
is prepa.red, just at the prasent mnoment, te
propose that it should be introduced during
the present session. Having eaid that, 1
wish to cail the attention of the House te
a very important feature in connection with
the inquiry cf the hon. and gallant member
frein Toronto. The hon. gentleman proposes
te
Oall the attention of the Senate te the unsatisfactory resulte attending the preuent mnethoda

of recrulting In Canada. The supply of men
who are eligible and who are willlng to enlist
is faut becomling exhauisted. and ofthe men who
are offering themeuelvea for enllatrnent a large
proportion la rejected for physical reazons. thus
entaihing much unnecessary trouble and expense.

I do not know how it may be in other
provinces, but I know that in the province
froin which 1 cerne there are very few rejectiens owing te physicai defects. But the
point je this: one weuld imagine frein the
language used by the hon. and gallant
member that we were not doing very wel
in Canada now; that, in tact, we were net
doing anything like our duty in the matter
of supplying recruits. But what is the fact?
I see froin a return submitted in another
place that frein the Ist cf January cf the
present year up te the 15th April there were
ever 101,000 men recruited. New it seems
to me that that je net doing tee badly, considering the population of the country and
coneîdering what had been done already.
To recruit in three monthe and a haîf 101,000
men le pretty satisfactory werk. And
further, if one were disposed te think that
we should have had a larger number cf
recruits, any hon. gentleman whe stops te
think wili see that prebably the 101,000 men
are as many as can be unifermed and otherwise equipped in anything like reasonable
time. The administration et the departnient here je net able-and 1 arn net finding any fault with the departrnent at ahlbut it really cannot go ahead any quicker
than the recruiting is goin- cahead, and 1
do net think there le any reasen te find
fault or cemplain about slackness in
recruiting. Tlîat being the case, I do net
that we should
think it is desirable
undertake te question the matter here.
The SPEAKER-Has the Government any
reply te the inquiry?

Brig. Gen. the Hon. Mr. MASON-While
it ie true that we have had a large number
ci men enlisted since the beginnîng of the
year, the objection taken is not te the number eoming forward, but to the class that
cornes forward. Men are coming forward
who cannot be spared froin their employments. As you see by the cerrespondence
I have read, our industries are suffering
severeiy by reason of the empioyeee enlieting. Those are the men who- compose that
101,000 who -have come forward since the
liet of the year. Many of those men should
not be aliowed te eniet. There ie a very
large number of men who ought ta be serving as soldiers who are not inciined to enliet. Those men should be get at. That is
one ef the objecte 1 had ini view in suggesting registration. Then, again, it, je stated
that there wouid be ne expense or trouble
saved by regi'stration. I ehouid like to add
that there je a great deal of expense incurred by ree.son of the difficulty of getting
enen. In Toronto there are recruiting sergeants ail over the city, and no douht in
other cities just the saine. Thoee men have
ta be paid for what they are doing, and the
recuits -are not at ail in keeping with the
efforts made te get the men. That je one
source of expenée that would be saved.
Then, again, men are eniisted and trouble
le gone te in the uniforming of tbem, andi
it je discovîered that they are mot eligible or
capable for the work th.at is before thein.
They are recruiting eeven battalions in Toronto at the present moment; tha-t ie, after
nearly two years of the war to which Toron.to has se largely contributed in the way
ef men, and now they are asking Toronto
to fill up seven new hattalions at one time.
That ie causing a great deal of trouble and
a great deal of expense that could be
avoided were registration in effect and were
other parte of Canada contributing their
f air ehare of the men required.

said at that trne, "Why have one wei.ght

Hamiîton-Gault divorce case?
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-There was a
higher grade of society involved.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-It is suppressing
the evidence, I eall it. Putting it on the
t
Table does no* mean publicity or publication to the publie. The committeo gives
ail the evidence printed in pamphlet ferai,
distributed ta anembers of the Hanse cf
Commons, ta members of the Senate and
te, ail officiais who are entitled ta it, in
every other case. Why was that iiot done
in this case? 'Where is the nigger in the

WhAt dees ail this mean? Now the coinmittee can see, and ail the legisiators ought
ta see, that it dees net pay ta have two
measures and twa weights for difforent
cases; and this is the result. I hold that
the Clerk af the Committees of this Heuse
should nat be permitted ta leave his duties
te produce this evidence before the courts
of Mantreal or any other courts in this
Dominion of Canada. They have nothing ta
do with it. If evidence taken here is produced in the courts of Montreai who is
going to prove that that evidence is correct? Ahl that the Cierk of the Committees
can do is ta hand the document over. Who
is ta be in the court at Montreal ta say
that the witnesses.were properly examined
and that the evidence as given was properly
placed before the Parliament of Canada?
The Clerk of Gommittees will be unabie
ta do so; ail hie can do is ta bring the
document down and hand it ta the prosecuting or defending attorney in the case.
I say that the Clerk of Committees
shouid nlot be made a servant of any defending or any prosecuting attorney in a

especially in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton)-I wish ta
correct one statement of the hon. member
who has just resnmed his seat, and that
is the statement that the Divorce Committee treated this Gault divorce case differently from -any other case. That is absolutely not 80.
'Hon. Mr. OLORAN-You did not print
the evidence.
Hon. Mr. ROSS OMiddlaton)-We do not
print the evidence, and the hon. gentleman
knows ive do not print the evidence ini any
case çwhere a petition is refused. We reported the evidence back to the House, th-_
same in that case as any other case. The
insinuation that there was anything different in the treatment of this case is entirely
incorrect.
Hon. Mr. DANflURAND-I amn surprised
to hear a senator whose conscience prevents
him votinig on a Bill of Divorce, conrplaining ibecause a report bas been submfftted
by the Divorce Committee, .denying à
divorce. Such a decisjon. should be, it
seems 'to me, satisfactoxry to the hon. gentleman fram Victoria division.. He complains
now that the evidence has not been printed,
but I should aie 4to know for whose enlightenment it should be printed. Not for
his, because even if he ielt there was
evidence to warrant a divorce, he would
not vote for ft. I cannot, therefore, understand why he risea to complain that the
evidencp has not been printed.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I dqd not oomplairl
for myseif.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-For whom is
the hon, gentleman complaining?
Hon. Mr. CLORÂN-For the public.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Surely my hon.
friend bas enough sense of morality not to
desire that this kind of evidence 5hould be
distributed te the -public. Surely he does
nlot wish te express the desire that any
such evidence should 'b given to the public.
Now he is surprised that this evidence is
asked for by the courts of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-What was the
reaýson it was suppressed P
Hon. Mr. WATSON-It -was not surpressed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I arn -nt a
niember of the Divorce Committee, but I
have heard it stated that when a report

was a negative one, ordinarily the evidence
is nlot printed. Il that is a correct statement, it should suffice. The courts of
Montreal are asking for the evidence which.
was heard here. If it were denîed, the
witnesses who were, heard here could be
called in Montreal to repeat their evidence.
I suppose :some exhibits which were produced before the committee are 'wanted.

Montreal. That remains of record in the
Senate, but the clerk who goes with the
record will -be able to furnish certified copies
of the documents on record, and perhaps
deliver copies af the evidence, if the parties
in Montreal agree to aceept that evidence,
in lieu of placing the parties themselves
upon the stand.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-WVould the evidence
as taken before our Divorce Committee be
admitted before the courts of Montreal and
taken as proper evidence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURÂND-It would by
consent of the parties, and most probably
the court has authority to decide upc.n that
point itself, if there should be any divergence of opinion.
Hon.. Mr. SPROULE-Either I misunderstand what the court desires, or the hon.
gentleman Js wrong in bis conclusion. I
did not understand that the 'court required
the evidence that was taken here, but the
records of the Senate. What are the recods
There was a divorce case belore
the Senate. The petition was thrown out.
That would be shown in the Journals of the
House. I did not see the exact wording
of the application, but I know from hearing
many of these discussions regarding demands from courts'for information in elctien trials, that it is the record of the House
that la wanted. It is nlot their aim or desire, so far as I know, to take up the evidence in the divorce case and review, contradict and discuse it there.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-I do not know which
aide is applying for it, whether Mr. or Mrs.
Gault.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-That is a
matter of indifference.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-But supposinga it is
Mrs. Gault? Only the evidence 'in ber

the defence wha-tever evidence was given
in Mr. Gault's favour would be taken out

of the record and published. I have net a
braas button of interest in the matter, as
the hion. chairman of the Divorce Committee said: the enly thing is that we have been
no far successful in keeping scandai quiet,
and I do trust that the Senate will persist
in its decision, and flot allow this document to leave the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-Applications were
made by both aides for copies of tht evidexice taken in the Ganît divorce case, and
refused by the Divorce Comrnittee. They
were told if they wanted it, to apply to tht
Senate of Canada, as being the only authority to give permission to use it, and I thixik
that was quite proper. That is the position se far as the two parties to tht suit
are concerned, and I think if the clerk ia
given permission to obey the subpoena hie
might receive instruction as to how hie
ahould deal with tht ev.idence, which 1 take
it te be really the records of the Senate.
With regard to the non-printing of the
evidence, I made inquiries, when that report was laid befere the Senate, with regard to tht printing cf the evidence, and
was told then that it was not the practice
te have the evidence .Printed when tht
committet reported againat tihe granting of
the decret unless it was apecially ordertd
by the Senate. Se that there was ne different action in regard te the printing evidence in this Hamilton Gault case, than ini
regard te any other case in which the ceinmittee dtcidtd to report against the grantiiig oi tht divorce. Personally, I can set
ne reason why tht request should net be
granttd. Both, sides are asking fer it, se
that it is net one aide oniy that would
have tht advsntage e! it; both have asked
for it. I can ste no reason for it. I understand they are both applying for separa.
tien, both have enttred actions, ont against
tht ether, and if the evidence taken here
would help them any I de net set why Vhty
should net have it.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That is a matter
which tht Senate should recognize. Ont of
His Majesty's superior courts of the province cf Quebec has issued a aubpoena, and
1 doubt very *much if you will find any case
in the histery of tht country where Parliament has refused te snswer a subpoena.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-There is a case in one
of tht courts in Montreal. Ont of the judges
erdered a convict in St. Vincent de Paul te
bt brought te Montreal. The Dtputy Minister o! Justice put his veto on it, and they
could net override the Minister of Justice.
Would there net be a way out of tht difficu.lty' Supposing the Senate authoriztd
tht clerk te go te 'MontreaI with a copy certifitd by tht proper authorities stating that
precetdings for a divorce were enttrtd in
tht Sexiste, that tht committet heard tht
evidence, and saw fit net te grant the petitien. It strikes me that oug.ht te be sufficient te prove that there had been an application for a divorce, and tht evidence net
being suffloient, tht divorce had been
refused.

Hon. Mr. GLORAN-In regard te the
dignity cf tht courts o! Montreal, the hion.
leader of tht Heuse aheuld censuit tht
dignity cf tht Senate, whieh is tht highest
court in tht land. It is net tht judgt cf tht

of nearly a year to get ready to comply
with the Act when it cornes into force.
Personally I arn in favour of the legisiation.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-As my views on this
question have been given to a great extent
ini the newepapere of Montreal. Eng-land
and France, I think it proper to express
my views here now. When I was a member of the local Legislature in Quebec I
laid before the House a Texuperance Bill
which was considered ahead of tirne and
too drastie.
1 suppose now it would be
considered behind the times and flot up to
date.
I have alwaye thought that prohibition was not the best means of checking intemperance. Extreme meaeures are
always dangerous and they defeat the object in view.
I think that restriction is
better than prohibition.
Very often prohibition does flot prohibit, and it gives rise
to ail kinde of devices to evade the law.
I will -ive you an example.
Thirteen
years ago I had been invited to lecture in
a littie town in New England. While going
there I remarked to a gentleman that they
had no hotels -there. He said, "No, we
have a severe law, nobody le ailowed to
seli liquor, no license is given to sel
apirituous liquor, but," hie said, "'we have a
fine cellar. Will you corne down and see itP"
1 went 'with him; we went to lunch in the
basement. The room was filled with bookcases, which. had a very good appearance,
and hie called for the librarian, who came,
and hie said, "Show to this gentlemen your
collection of books."
He replied, -Yes,
yes, 1 arn pleased to do it,- and he put
before me three or four books. I took the
books; there were volumes with those very
great names which. the English people, and
we French people as well, admire so much.
Shakespeare, Milton, Gladstone and others.
Then hie said, "Whom do you prefer?"
My friend said, "Open the books."
I
opened the books, and in the book marked
Shakespeare I found brandy; in the other
book marked Milton there was Bourbon
whisky- and you know Bourbon whisky
is very popular in the United States. He
sys, - Which do you prefer?" I said,
"Well, I arn between Shakespeare and
Milton, 1 do flot know exactly." Anyhow,
that wvas one of the devices which. are
resorted to in order to evade the law.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Where was that?
What town?
Hon. Mr. DAVID-I do flot like to give

It was under the
Hon. ýMr. THOMPSON.

conviction that there was sorhething better
than prohibition to check intemperance
that, when I was a member of the local
Legislature in Quebec, I întroduced the
Bill of which I spoke in commencing my
speech. I will sum up some of the provisions of that Bill, and caîl your attention
to them. One was the high license system,
giving the right to ssii spirituous liquors
to a certain class of hotels paying a license
high enough te get rid of shebeens and
canteens which. adorn the corners of our
streets in the great cities, especially where
the working man returning to his home
stops to meet bis friends and spends sometimes a great part of his wages, te the
detriment of his family. Were the working
man obliged te go te the Ritz-Carlton or te
the Windsor, in Montreal, or te the
Chateau Laurier or te the Russell House in
Ottawa, hie would not stop because hie would
not find his friends there. even if hie would
be admitted, and hie would not change
his clothing in the evening te go back te
the Windsor to drink. I tbink that is one
of the principal evils which we ought te
try te remove. A second featurs of my Bull
was custems and excise duties upon the
importation and manufacture of spirituous
liquors. You will remark in this case that
although so much is done in order te prevent importation of spirituous liquors into
the province of Ontario, nothing is done te
prevent the manufacture. That is a curious
anomaly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-And they have a right
te spread their liquors everywhere.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-That is right; that
'is the point.

I think it is the best and most successful
way to check intemperance. Nevertheless,
in spite of that, I had decided te vote for
this Bill; but alter exanîining it I came
to the conclusion that I could not vote
for it, first because 1 have grave
doubts as to the constitutionality of the Bill.
I think that the objection of the hon. meinber for De Lanaudière deserves consideration
and that the clause cited by the hion. meinber for De Salaberry iii answer to the

be able to show that he knew that the
shipping of intoxicating liquor was in violation of the law of the province?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-And you enact that he
may be sued either in the province from
which. the intoxicating liquor is exported,
or in the province into which it is impotted,
s0 that, as I aaid yesterday, a man frein
New Brunswick or from Prince Edward
Island prosecuted for violation of the law
may be suied in British Columbia. Imagine
in what position it would place that man.

business have notified the Government of
Ontario that they will flot accept the responsibility of dealing out liquor. Therefore, I
say that this measure brought down by the
Government ie simply a makeshitt. If they
lintened in a meàsure to the temperance
people, they ehould have listened to the
prohibition -people-not the teinperance
people, because they are not temperate; a
prohibitionist is neyer temperate; temperance is a happy mediurn between the two
extremes. Temperance je a virtue; prohibition je an extreme. If the Government
had listened to the appeals of the prohibitioniets they would have had the courage
to bring down a law .prohibiting the manufacture and importation of ail kinds of
spirits and liquors. That je within their
exclusive power. They did not do it. They
shoved off the prohibitionists with this paltry mesure, a loip-sided one, a one-legged
one, etriking a blow at Quebec in preventing. the province from exporting its producte into Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
or any other province that asks for it, and
allowing tbe neighbouring states, the Mother Country, tb. countries of Europe and
other foreign countries to bring into these
provinces ail that they want. But the blow
is driven at Québec. That ie the size of it.
Lift the veil. Hide the carde; we can see
through thein. The Governnient by this
legisiation eannot command the respect of
prohtbitionios when they wake up sober in
the morui.

of thinge you are going to create by this
legisiation. I the-refore conceive il my duty
in the name of temperance, not in the name
of prohibition or intemperance, to vote for
the amendment. Prohibition and intemperance are the fingers on bthe same hand,
they meet. They go hand-mn-band. I arn
in favour of t.mperanoe in eating, in drinking. and ini other walks of if e whicb are
too delicate to mention. I arn in favour
of temperance; it is on. of thle four cardinal
virtues. I congratulat. the bon. gentleman front Halifax on having the courage,
before the assernbly of distinguished Chuisliane called senators, to 'quote the ordinances cf tbe 01<1 Testament ,as well as of
the New, against this measure. Il takes

case, that the burden of taxation under
most systems bas fallen upon those least
able to bear it. There is imported into this
Bill which is now before us for our consideration what I might say is a new principle ini taxation. It proposes taxing profits
and excepting frein those profits a reasonable earning power«of the capital invested,
namely 7 per cent, se far as incorporated
companies are concerned, and excepting 10
per cent in respect to individuals who may
be engaged in business.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-Why should
there be the difference between individuals
and corporations?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There is a difference in the Bill. Why it is I am n ft
discussing at the moment. It might afterwards be thought worthy of soine discussion. The Bill proposes, after excepting
those rates of percentage upon capital, that
25 per cent of the extra profits shall ha the
tax levied upon the companies embraced
withîn the Bull.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Why limit it te Z
per cent?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Well, owing to
the sweet reasonableness o! the Government, I should say.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-I should say so.
Hon. 'Mr. LOUGHELD-There is at present every reason why companies, that wilI
be reached by this Bill should bear their
burden of taxation, which necessarily has
to ha raisad froin the body politie at the
present time. Fortunately for Canada most
of the large businessea of the country have
been in a fiourishing condition since- the
war began. Many of them have made most
extraordinary profits. A very large increase in the volume of business has been
*brought about by conditions of the war,
and it therefore bacomes nianifeet that the
Government should naturally look to those
businasses .best able to pay the tax rather
than to impose a tax uipon smaller coinpanies and individuals who at the present
time have very hargely borne the burden
and-heat of the day.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-A very sound
principle.
Hon. M!vr. LOUGHEED-It is - proposed
that there shail -be three accou.nting periods.
That the -businesses to which I have al]uded
shaîl -make three stat-ements, one period
extendîng from. December, 1914, to December, 1915. Then ancther period to 1916,
1T-

and another ýperiod to 1917. Every consideration is be'ing gîven in the Bill aB to
the payrnent of the tax, sO that it shahl
not prove unduly onerous upon those who
are called upon te pay it. In the avent of
any in-justice or of any parties who are
called 'upon to pay the tax conceiving that
they are suffering fromn an injustice, thay
wi1 ihave racourse, by 'way of appeal, to
a board o! refareas, and the machinery
which hpplias tk this board of refereas I
think is sufficiently ehaborate te ramova any
injustice which. niy *be done. The interpratation which shahl apphy to the word
"capital" has 'been involvad in more or
hess diffieulty, but I tbink upon perusing
the Bill hon. gentlemen wilh be able to
satisfy themsalves that the word "capital"
will racaive' suoh an interpretation as to
prevent any injustice (baing done. The
question of the valluation o! the physicaI
proparty of companies is dealt with, but it
is unnecessary for ime at this point te go,
into a detailad explanation as to sil the
particulars of the Bull, inasmuch as if we

than in any ectatamant made by me ajt this

Renumlng the s.djourned debate on the

Now I do not know that the hon. members
of this House have gone over what I said

what the people of that part of the country
thought of this proposition. As some of
the members probably were flot here the

quite a disturbance out in the West. For
the benefit ai those who were flot here when
thîs matter was discussed last week, I

through. that surrender. This Governmentsome of the members of whom wera in opposition at the tinie of the surrender-took
the ground that this surrender was illegal,
and that therefore the titie should not be
granted for this land. The present Government have been in power something like
four years, and have done nothîng in this
matter. It is about eight yeats since the
surrender was carried out and the land ail
tied up. Now it is flot for the benefit of
the Indians or anybody else té have it tied
Up in that way.
However, the Government, in order to carry out what they advocated, in Opposition, and to save their face
when in power, now contend that the surrender was illegal, and submitted the case
to the Exchequer Court. Without getting
any decision from the Exeiequer Court,
they corne down with this proposition that
we have before us, a Bill ta legalîze the
sale, but they want to assess the people
who bought this land at $1 an acre. We

ta say *what the people of that part
of the country thought about it.
The
Government of the day have been in power
for four years and have done nothing. The
people in that part of the country have
discussed and have passed resolutions in
regard ta the matter. The town of Selkirk
lies close ta that district and the people of
that district have been desirous for years
ta get the matter settled and have the
Indians put away where they could do something for themselves, and flot bother the
civilized people. I have here a copy of the
resolution of the Board af Trade at Selkirk
which reads as follows:
Whereas: the initial negotfiations for the
surrender of St. Peters Indian Reserve were
made in the year 1906. and the actual treaty
covering the surrender was affected early in
1907.
And whereas: The public sale of crown lands
in consequence of said treaty took place late
in the same year. 1907.
And whereas: beginning in the years 1908
and 1909, and subsequently, tities to the lands
purchased by virtue of said treaty were refused
by the Land Tities Department of Marfltoba.
Then did this Bloard. of Trade, in the year
1908. protest against the delay in possession of
the land, because of dlaims that were made and
concurrently reported. throwing doubt upon the
surrender; such protests being in the form. of

MAY 4, 1916

resolutions duty passed. and forwarded to the
proper authorities of the Dominion and Manitoba Governments.
And whereas. ln the year 1909. the Board of
Trade did personally watt upon Hon. Franfk
Cliver. then Minuster of the Interior, at Bel_
kirk and -petition him for an adjustment of the
niatter ePloring the delay; and Insofar as the
Department, Government and party he ropresented was concerned.
And whereas: ln the year 1910. the Government of Manitoba apviointed a Royal Commnisan ta investtgate and adjudicate the contraversy regarding the. legality of the St. Peter's
surrender. and whereas the said Commission
did eventualiy ait, and in the year 1911 being
ln a majority and a minority report. one of
which declared the said surrender Iliegal; the
other holding it ta be legal.
And whereas: ln the year 1910, the Right
lion. Sir Wilfrid Laurier. then Premier of
Canada. being appealed ta in persan at Selkirk,
did afiirm and reiterato the expressions of sympathy and consideratian for the district which
badl suffered such delay of justice.
And whereas: In the year 1911 a Dominion
eloction was held, then George IL Bradbury.
member for Selkirk. and the original complainant against the legality of St Peter's Reserve
surrender. did assure hie palitical supporters.
that. ln event af his return ta office with a
vintoricus party, that then delay would end,
guilt would quickly be meted ta the gurltY. if
any. Justice done. and the deadlock which had
then lasted four years finally broken.
And whereas: Subsequent ta the Blid eection and return of Mir. Bradbury ta office. at a
banquet tendered hlm ait Selkirk. under the
auspices of the Board of Trade. he then and
there reassured hie hearers of the forthooming
settlement of the whole contraversy; and laid:
"No matter what happens, I can Promise you
tht.: The Lands of St. Peter's will nover revert
ta the Indiana".
And whereas: In the year 1912. the Board of
Trade supportedl by a deputation of fifty members, presented ta the Hon. Robert Rogers.
Minister of the Interior. a petition signed by
the Board of Trade. the Town Council of Selkirk, the Councils of St Andrews and St.
Clements. and by over four hundred Individual
citizens. praying for a speedy adjustment of
the question. The minister in hie repiy promised
ta make every effort ta secure speedy settlement
and specificalîr stated. -We will settle titis
matter. It will not go into Court "
And ln the following year, in the same roam.
a similar petitian was presented by an almost
identical deputation ta the Hon. Mr. Rogers'
successor in the office af Minister of the Interiar. Hon. Dr. Roche, who then said "I propose ta take it' (this question) 'up immediateiy an my return for 1 fully realize the need
for expeditian. The three courses that I see
open are the appointment of a comnmission. the
cancellation af the aurrender and the legalizatian of the deals. AIl agree as ta the need of
expedition and ail are waiting for a final decistan. I can promise yau that I will take the
matter Up specially wtth the Minister af Justice
and wtth my olleagues as soan as if. is paszible".
And tin 1912 the buyers of St. Peter's Crawn
Lands completed their deferred payments ta
the Gavernment and the satd payments were
received and accepted.

The Gavernmnent claim the surrender was
iliegai. that the purchasers had no right or
titie ta, the land, though the people who
purchased it have been mikmng their payments each year. and the Indian Department and the Dominion Government have
been taking that maney and granting receipts, but they refuse to lift the cloud
upon the titie. The resolution continues:
"During the years 1912-13-14 four disputa-

tions f rom Selkirk waited up the members of
the Government of Ottawa and interceded by
every means in their power for a speedy settiement or adjudication.
A&nd ln 1914, Premier Sir Rodmond RobUin
of Manitoba offered ta Intercede at Ottawa ln
an effort to bring about a settlement of the

matter. In furtherance of this promise he went

ta Ottawa and personaliy appeared before the
Cabinet and Premier and did farmally Intercode and request a definite adjustment, out of
the court.
And during ail these years, tht, Board. by
letters, Interviews, and formai resolutions have
repeatedly pressed for settiement wtthout. further delay.
And in 1915 the municipal councils of St.
Clements. Selkirk and St Andrews, have p>etitioned deomnding an immediate adjuutmnent
by Parliarnontazy confirmation of the surrendor.
Be It; therefore resolved; this Board endorse
the position taken by thre municipal couneiis,
who are oa directly affected. recognlzing the
intolderable conditions which impel thom ta
their demand for the effective solution suggested.
And furtirer, that this Board now reiterate
Its position with respect ta the St. Peter'. Reserve surrendor as st forth ln the lant Annual
Repart, namely:
*"It la now eight years sInce the legsllty of

This legal Question <asine f rom the tact
that it bas resulted in the lands being to-day
lesa settled. less occupied and less cultlvated
than tbey were at tbe time of the surrender>
bas necessarily rendered doubtful and thereby
temporariiy suspended and practicaUly paralysed
our juriediction as a corporation in respect Of
these lands ln all matters whatsoever but especially in these four things. nainely: roadis.
ferries, achools and taxes. Ail surveying or
improving of roads ls necessariiy postponed
until the question is - ettied. Similarly with

Similarly with the establishment and maintenance of public schools districts ln this territory.

Bo, too. with our pound by-law and herd bylaw and the by-laws for gond government and

At every points our juriediction la unsettled
and the resuit is absolute confusion and substantial Ioss to this corporation.
And whereas ln our Judgment the delay of
the proper authorities at Ottawa or Winnipeg, or botb, (we express no opinion as to
where the responsibiiity lies) ln settling thîs
action bas been and is entirely unjustifable
and Inexcusable. AUl the facts were fufly known
tn the authorities wîthîn at most a year atter
the surrender and yet no action bas been taken
until a few montha ago wben a suit vas
started by the Dominion Government ln the
Exchequer Court of Canada to met aside Uic

surrender.

We emphaticaily protest against this suit.
In the tiret place, wbether thc final judgment
of the courts be for or against thc validity of
the surrender. the great delay necessarily involved in securing sucb final iudvnent would
be unfair to this municipality intolerably unfali when added to Uic aiready unwarranted
delay in starting the suit
Secondiy, if the final judgment should set aside
thc surrender thon a further periofi of delay
would be added for negotiating a fresh surTender and arranging and carrying out allet-

any compensation to the Indien (as to whicb
we express no opinion) then the Government
whose officials committed the Irregularities
sbould surely malte suci compensation.
Now therefore. for these reasons. this municipality In lits corporate capacity bereby urges
and demande, as the quickest and mont equitable and uatisfactory mode of settiement of the
question, that the surrender be confirmed by
the proper govermental or legisiation autboritien without further delay; and that a memoriai ln accordance witb this resolution be
prepared and executed on behaif of the municipality by the reeve and the secretary-treasurer under the corporate seal, and that the
sanne be communicated to the councils of the
town of Selkirk and the rural municipaity of
St Andrews respectively wlth a view to their
concurrence therein, and that thls resolution
or sucb joint memnoria be communicatedl to the
Minister of the Interior for CaLiada ;G. H. Bradbury, Esq.. M.P., the Miniater

certainiy the mont representative meeting of
the district that bas ever gathcrcd together.
The meeting had been cailed to discuse Uic St.

and its temper and

opinion may be gauged by the wording of the

resolution which was passcdl by an absolutcly
unanimous standing vote at its conclusion, au
follows:
"That this public meeting of the citizens ot
Selkirk and district, as assembîcd without personal intercst or political affiliation, actuated
by the acute realization of Uic gross injury that
bas been and is stîll bcing done to the district
through the non-settlement of the St. Peter's

Hereby resolved: That a body representative of the entire community and district, we

at ail about that. One of these letters on
file reads as follows:
Rlght Hon. ]ELU Borden,
Prime Minister,
Ottawa.Dear Sir-I amn taking the liberty of brlnglng ta your attention me of the facto ln connection witii a dliculty of seven years standing
-the St Peter% Indien ]Reserve case.
The Liberal Governiment wile ln power, commissloned Honourable Justice Howeii to efet
a surrender of tiie St. Peter's Indian Reserve
as 4 resuit of representatioflm made by the people of Selkirk. ln order ta gain a greater mcasure of dcvelopmeflt in that section, and wilci
lande lmmediately adjolned the town of Selkirk
on its northern boundary. Instead of conforrning ta the statutory form of surrender, the
commissioner perrnltted himself ta be prevalied
upon to the extent of allewlng the Indiana to
se11 a portion of their lands, and the balance
was ta have been sold In accordance wltii the
usual method employed ln effecting surrenders
under the. **the Indien Act". A surrender was
affected& and la due time,4 ln accordance wlth
the regulations, the land surrendered by the
Indiana was advsrtlsed to be sold 1»' auction.
and the lande whlch the. Indiana secured for
their own une and maie have moetiy been disposed of. The act of *elling the -lande urrendered. waa ln accordance witii the. regulationa govei'ftng the. sale of Indien lands. and
the, purchasea wbo bought tiiose lands, bought

sale. It la conceded that the purchasera have

If traud were discovered, a sultable penalty

dollar an acre ta buy peace let the
Dominion Governmnent pay it. The Dominion Government sold this land and teok
their maney, and the patents were regi&tered under tbe aid system in Selkirk, and
naw the Government cames along and maya
the tiLle is, no good. By the speeches of
some of aur principal men they say, " We
bave attacked this patent and yau muet
pay us one dollar an acre." For the
Government of thia country ta get down te
such miserable pettifogging as that when
tbey haven't a foot ta stand on is ridiculous.
Tbey neyer proved a thing againat tihe peopie who bought the land; the land was
advertised and sold in the ordinary way;
there ia no suggestion that the men who
bought thia land d.id nat acquire it legaily
and pay for it. The Dominion Gavernment
made the sale. The matter lias, been dragged alang three yeara in the Bouse of Commons ta allow Mr. Bradbury ta make political capital, and now, w'hen they find that
the shoe la pinching and the people up
there are getting bat, they bave ta take it
out af the Exehequer Court, and they are
gaing te settie iL. They ouglit either to go
ahead in the Exchequer Court or give the
people title ta this land; there is no other
way of doing it. It is either nigbt or wrong.
If it is bad, according ta their own argument, ta eat tihe Indiens out ai $15 an acre,
surely it la not goad te beat them out ai
$14: The very fact of bringing down this
Bill is sufficient evidence that the Government considered that surrender ail right.
When t.he, surrender is ail right thé purclissera should get their tiLle. They put* a
cloud on the titie themaelves and ask for a
dollar an acre is merely a hold-up. There
is not a man that bought those lands but
feele that h. is being theld up ta the extent
of a dollar an acre. The argument they
used with the Indiane was, "Oh, you gave
21,000 acres of land away." Those Indians
were practically hall-breeds, who had
settled theïre before the Manitoba Act came
into force, and under thst Act every man
that ýquatted on land was entitled ta the
land lie is liviing an, and those half-breeds
were given a riglit to enter the Reserve as
Indians or take citizenship. They went into
the Reserve as 'idians, but neyer allowed
their dlaim ta those lands ta lapse; they
always held the land. What -right lied the
Dominion Government ta dictate ta those
people what they should do with -this land
after giving it ta them? The . halfhreed
owning a piece of land said, '«that la mine,
I hiave been on it 30 yearz-, and I want iL."

Mr. Howell, alfter ixvvestigating ail the facts,
said, -Yes, you are entitled ito it." An
arrangement was made and tbey got thie
land; they did not get a titie, but they got,
as goad as a titie, and because in eom&
cases they aold this cheaper than they
should have aold it, the Governuient ancr
the officiais are blamed. Now, the Government is flot ta blame for that; the Department of Indian Affairs d.id everythi!ng they
could to stop the Indians from making away
with it; they even went 5s ase to write a
letter up saying that noa tranafer from the
Indians would be recognized, that they
were going to issue the patents practically
ta the people who owned this land to try
and lessen the trouble of them seiling it taa
cheap. But if they did seil it toa cheap.
it was theirs; the Dominion Government
had nathing te do with it. I submit that
alter this trouble bas been hanging on for
ei.ght yearis, and played with like a football.
as the people of Selkirk say, it is Lime to
settie iL in an equitable way by treating
the people decently. The party who held
it up was the Registrar Generai of ManiLoba, Mr. Macara, who had no more right
ta do so than the man in the moon had.
He w~as teld ta hald iL up by the Rablin
Government, who appointed the commission- te investigate Indien lands, and they
had fia right ta, appoint that commission.
IL was ail politics, and it la politica te-day.
and,if they want te settie this the beat
way is te give the titie te it te the people
who bought the land.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-This is very
reasonable-à dollar an acre.
Hon. Mr,. DAVIS-I wish te draw my
hon. friend's attention ta the cry that was
raiaed in the other Hause about the poor
Indian, that it was not a just surrender,
that you are gaing ta make away with bis

Hon. Mr. DÂNDURÂND-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The Crown bas made
a sale of lands by public competition
and a great many people have been purchasing those lands and they are now
asked. to pay a dollar an acre to get a titie
that they can register and aeil the land.
Everything that has been said by my hon.
friend is history and has heen for a nurnber cf yeare, because shortly a5ter «he
zale took place an interference was made
and the tities were held up. -For the hast
twenty-flve years there has been an agitation at Selkirk for the purpose o1 gettinu,
surrender of that Indian Reserve. Every
person mnust know that where an Indian
reserve butts up againat a town the size of
Selkirk, the people of that town are anxious
Io get rid of the reserve for good reasons.
One reason is that the Indian -becomes a
ruisance because he is contaminated by
the white man and whisky; another is that
they want settlers on the land to support
the town, and the municipality of 8t.
Clemnent's and the town of Selkirk have for
the last twenty-five years been agitating to
get Tid -of that reserve. Some years ago,
after report was made to the late Government. Chief Justice Howell was asked to
go there and make a report as to what he
considered would be a fair deal for the Inidians in connection with that reservewhetiher the reservation should be disposed
of, because it bas been stated by the mernHon. Mr. DAVIS.

ber for Prince Albert that a number of
Indians on that reserve had separate holdings as natives prior to the reserve being
set aside. Mr. Howell went down there
and talked wxth the Inidians and amongst
other things he suggeeted that tihe Indians
who had occupied land as squatters, or
settiers, should have a proportion of land
to themaelves independent o~f any reserve
entirely. I think the arnount aIlotted was
twenty-one acres to each individual of a
certain class who had occupied those la.nds
for a number of years. He aloo made
the suggestion to those Indians, which was
riot acceptable to thern that they should
make the Bev. Mr. Syrnons, who wae an

Ihat sale being conducted by the Indians,
tried to dispose of the titie to the twentyone acres of land which were sold for a
few dollars, and as a bluff suggested to
the registrar of Manitoba that they should

later on, when Mr. Bradbury got busy, 4they
enforced that instruction they had given to
the Registrar of Tities. That surrender was
arranged by Mr. Howell, Chief Justice of
Manitoba. He made a report to the Governrnent. The Governinent instructed their
officers to proceed to the reserve and to
secure the acceptance of the Indians to the
surrender. After the land was advertised
for sale at public auction it was sold to the
highest bidder and they bought, paid their
money and expect to get titie. Now the

flot register them, they could not dispose cf
the land. They refused to pay taxes, hence
that petition from St. Clienents municipality
in which the reserve is situated. If that
reserve was flot properly disposed of the
whole thing- should be set aside. I say it is
an injustice which should not be tolerated
and we ougaht to make good the title of the
Crown by giving those people the land at

MAÀY 4, 1916

possibly that haif of those lands were sold to
American citi.zens because at that time a
number of Americans were coming into that
country buying up land and settling up the
country. Well, it is a nice advertisement
to say thet they buy land from the Crown'a
auctioneer and eight years afterwards are
asked for another dollar -an acre. I say it ii
nothing but a system of blackmail and
should not be sanctioned by this House, and
personally, knowing a good deal of the circumstances in connection with this matter,
I ahall surely vote for striking out that extra
dollar an acre. I amrn ot a la'wyer, but I
cannot seme how this Government can interfere with the registration of the titie of that
land. I understand the patents vere issued,
and the registration ougbt te be within the
jurisdiction of the province of Manitoba,
and 1 cannot understand how this Government could interfere with the registratiomi of
those tities. But they dlaim that the tities
were held by the late Government o! Manitoba. When Dr. -Montagne, now deceased,
was running an election in that constituency as a member of the Manitoba Legislature and Minuster of Public Works, one
o! hie pledges to the electors was that if
he was elected those people would get tities
te their land within tbree months and the
whole matter would be settled.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Without any dollar to
it, too.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-That was the promise, an'd my hon. friend has read the declaration from St. Clement's xnunicipality, and
it sheuld be sufficient justification for the
people in Ottawa and the Parliament of
Canada te issue those tities te the people
wbo bought this land. It is flot charged
that the sale was net properly conducted
or the sale was net properly advertised,
the onily charge is that the land was not
properlW secured, an insufficient numnber o!
Indians being present. My hon. frîend has
given the figures, and I venture to say
that if that surrender can be set aside there
is hardly a surrender made in the whole
Northwest that could not be set aside. Pr-actically every one o! them could be set aside.
In fact, every one of thein could be set
aside. Why should we interfere and bold
up these people because Mr. Bradbury
wanted te embarrasa the late Governrnent
in their dealing with the land? I do flot
think it is fair, and I trust that the sense of
this House, whicb is flot affected by politice
a the other House is, will see te it that jus-

tice is dene te those people in the purchase
of their lands.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I reside very
far from Selkirk, and sInmply know about the
matter as I have heard it discussed in the
other House and here, and there is mornetbing about it that is se extraordinary te

the purchasers of thEse lands desiring to effect

conducted for sorne considerable time between
the Justice Departmnent and the barrister representing the purchasers of the lands, and for a
long time they failed to arrive at any satisfactory solution of the difflculty. In June of last
year, in view ot that uncertainty that talways
exista with regard to the termination of legal
cases--for whichever party lost there wouid be
an appeal to the Privy Council-also in view of
the fact that the deveiopmenta of the country
adjacent to the town of Selkirk would be

deemed advisable to accept an ofier which waa

Hon. Mr. WATSON-SBo far as 1 amn personally concerned, I care not what the bar-rister may have signed. The Govern.ment
were holding up this land; they could not
register the tities; and I do not think that
legialators should encourage the Goveruiment
or inybody who had power to blackmail
those innocent purchasers. There has been
no ev'idence shown by the leader of the
Housqe that this sale was net properly conducted. There was a doubt as to proper
aec'urity, but that is the répresentations by
the Government's own agents. A board of
thlree judgeS Wua appointed to aettle tbis

tbe two judges claiming that there should

agreeing to the aurrender. The other judge
said as long as a sufficient nuinher of Indians were present and madle the aurrender
it was valid. If the iuling of those two
judges who made the report -was adhered

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-This debate has

deservedly so, the attention of a great many
of our Canadian people.
Wheu I brought this question cf the
escape of the enemiea of the Allies from

in the interest cf the Empire at -large, and
particularly the int-erests of Canada. Canada was then sending rmany of its best and

and while that was being done, officers

allowing alien enemies te escape from the

kill thofe that we were sending over te

That was an appalling

were nat performing their duty and that
they were allowing Hun enemies ta escape
and go abroa&'to their native country sO Bs
ta fight the allies. I asked for information;
1 ask for light. It took some time for
the Gavernment ta bring down. the information. I have the information in my hand.
The country wiUl be surprlised ta learn that
thé situation is ten times worse than at
first stated even by rumeur. Rumour had
it that the officer in command of that detentien camp at Amherst, in the province af
Nova Scotia, had been tried by court martial
and sentenced ta death. That rumour was
prevalent &Rlaver the Maritime Provinces,
espeoially New'Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
It reached Ottawa; it spread *over the vast
Dominion, that the officer in command o!
the detention camp had been court mar-'
tialed and sentenced ta be shot. The rumeur

dwindled down ta an imprisanmient ta
twelve years -by court martial înstead ai a
sentence of death. Wel1, that rumeur lasted
for a %veek,t.wa weeks. The officier in command of that detention camp instead oi
being shot wvas in one of the penitentiaries.
I asked for light. I wanted ta know in what
penitentiary he was. I could nat find out.
I have found out since that the officer who
was supposed ta have been sentenced ta
death, and was afterwards supposed ta be
incarcerated in one of the penitentiaries, is
to-day in Ottawa, enjoying a high office iu
one of the Militia departrnents. He has
go t promotion instead of being shot or incarcerated. I arn not going ta give his
name, because his naine has been suppre.ssed in this report, hut what I
stated as a fact, is a fact. The information I have got ta place before the House
cames from the Government. I hold in rny
hand a report ai the court, not the court
martial, that was a misnamer ta start
with. There wvas neyer any court martial

aliens that the fact is to be muade knuwn te
the peojple of Canada. They have been in-.
formed Iram other sources that a court martial was held in Haiax to try the officers,
for the escape of &lien enemies from our
detention camps. There was no court martial at Ha'lifax; there was no court martial
at Aiiiherst; there was no court martial
whatever. Then, what was there? There
was, simply a court of inquiry to find out
how the Huns dug their way through the
ground and broke through the stone wall
of the camp. Induiry was held at Amherst
in the prison under three respectable officers. Th'eir duties, dictated hy the head of
the department, General Otter, were very restricted,1 and no responsihility. They were
simply instructed to find eut how the Germans and Huns and aliens of the Empire
got away from them. They had no authority or power to attempt ta find guilty or
punish-simply ta ascertain the iacts. regarding this case. That is an astaunding
fact to make known to the public of Canada.
1 may say that the three officers who were
appointed by the Militia Department to con.
duct this inquiry-I will not say they did
the best that could be done, but they did
the best they could. They examined about
ten or twelve. witnesses. I will try and
epitomize the evidence, gîven by officers of
that camp at the inquiry. The court sat in
one of the buildings 'of the qetention camp
situated at Amherst. They called witnesses
ta prove their own negligence. What do
you think.of that? The camp was evidentIy run in a very desultory manner. The
camp was more of a play ground than a
prison or detention camp, and when the
people of this country corne ta consider
the matter, and when they corne ta compare
the treatrnent of our Canadian soldiers crucified on barn doors, shot, starved. made
ta suifer every inhumanity, and we know
that they are suifering it as well as the
prisoners of the other allied pawers, the
evidence is strongu enough ta say that Germany is exercising its scientific barbarism,
not only on the waters of the seas, and on
the batt]efields of Europe, but they are exercising their scientiflo barbarismi against
humani creatures locked up in their camps
and prisons, and when the people af Canada
and of the world corne ta consider the treatment extended ta aur soldiers in the detention camps, in foreign countries and the
treatment extended ta the Huns and aliens
in aur camps, they will rise against this

whether any criminai proceedings were

answer the last question and I abject ta the
discussion ai the entire aubject.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I arn confining the
debate ta the inquiry. I am piaciug before

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Am I not allowed ta

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN--Can the minister

papers brouglit down ta be produced before
the House?P a the leader of the Hanse

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I cobject ta any
discussion. I draw attention to the tact
that the papers have been brought down,
consequentiy t.hat can.not be diseussed. The
only thing that can be discussed is the
inquiry.
The ACTING SPEAKER <Hon. Mr.
Sproule>-It would flot be perînissable ta
take up the history of what was carried on
in the detention camp and discuss that
under this order. 1 think the hon. senator wouid be quite within has rights ta draw
attention ta those papers, but with reference ta going into the history ot the camp
and what taak place at the camp, I think
hie wauld be out of order. It seems ta me
that it is irregular ta discuse a mere question, but I find tram Bourinot thet it lias
been the practice in this Hause though, it
is not permissable in the other Hanse.
Therefore in giving the ruling that the han.
member is in order in direeting the attention of the House ta this matter, 1 arn following what lias been the usual custami in
this Hanse, but I think ini daing that he
should keep within the aubject ta which hie
ia drawing attention.
Hon. Mr. CLOR&N-That ia exactly what
I amn doing. I ar n ot doing it for the delectation or pleasure of the hon. leader of
the Government. I am simply gaing to
put before the House and country the resuit of this inquiry as shown in the papers
produced by the Government. The inquiry
was started and officers called, and they
were asked, how dîd the escape happen.
One gentleman, Captain Ridant, said that
the prisaners were allowed ta go into town
or into the cîty ta make purchases and ta
bring them iu unexamined. The result was
that the prisaners had cold chiseis, rakes
ar.d shoveis and everythîng necessary for
tunnelling. Another officer swore that as
the Huns had money ta spend they might
aý well be allowed to go and spend il, and
tliat officer was tak-en ta task later an. He

did not say where the sl.ight profit went
ta. But I must eongratulate General Otter, when he found it out, on having put a
stop ta it. They bought ail they wanted.
There was a large building in the- institution called the sand bouse. It was unoccupied and padlocked, but wh.at, did the Huns
do? They went down ta the village, baught
a brand new padiock with hall a dazen
keys, taok the military padlock off that
building, and put on the new one for which
they had the keys.
The ACTING SPEAKER <Sprouie)-I
think the han, gentlemn is wide af the

Hon. Mr. OLORAN-I will read ail the
documents if the bon. gentleman wants me
to.
The ACTING SPEAKER (Sproule)-The
notice says that the hon, gentleman wiil

HOn. Mr. CLORAN-I arn quite willing ta

the country ta know that such ruling is
stifing the facts af the case. In view not
of the point of order raised by the hon.

A QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.

Hon. Mr. OLORAN-Before 'the Orders cof
t.he Day are called, it may be interesting
and useful for the Senate to know that an
han. senator cannot have official, publie
and senaterial documents at hie cornmand,
or at bis convenience. Yesterday, during
a debate on a certain question. I made it
my business to go to the Clerk of the Bouse
and ask for the production of records and
reports, public and officiai ta be used by
me. The Clerk was kind enough to send
the page for them. I saw the page bring
down records, very bulky documents, smre
400 or 600 pages, and place them. on the
table. The package rernained 'there. 1
called the page and sent hirn over ta the
Clerk, and. asked him ta be kind enough
ta send aver these publie records, belanging ta the people, and belonging to their
representatives. The Clerk very politely
declined., I sent -the page back and asked
him why, and he -said "You cannat have
them." I said, "What? Cannot have themn
even on the floor of the Hos? He said,
"No." Then I sent back and asked why
I could not have them, and he said -"Not
wîthout the permission of the Speaker." I
amn very -humble and submit to authority,
except when authority abuses me. I went
to the Chair and said, ««Why cannat 1
have these documents, records and reports?" and he said, " You can have them,
but at the Table and on the Table." I
would havc no chair ta -sit on and. wouid

BILL.
DEBÂTE RESUMED.

On the Order beiing called:
Resumlng the adjourned Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading of Bill 66, An Act
In aid of Provincial Leglulation prohibItlng or

IAquors." and the Motion In amnendrnent of the
Honourabie Mr. Power that the said Bill ho
not now read a second time but that it be read
this day six monthe.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I rnight and passibly should have allowed this debate ta
terminate yesterday, but when I rose at a
few minutes ta six o'clock, I had in my
mind the attitude takien by zny bon. 4riend
and colleague from Moncton <Hon. Mr.
McSweeney) who very eloquently, as is
customary with him, expressed an opinion
in this part.icularc.ase-which was fot mine
-ta wit, itb.at the Sen.ate should rejeotthis
Bill. On second consideration, knowing my
hon. friend as I do, I decided that it was
possibly a round-about way ta reach the
,conclusion which 1 entertained; because
I know him ta b. a temperate man. Hia
way of getting ta the goal ie different, but
bis abject is, no doubt, identical with mine.
The. part.icular poinSt reai.ed that I desire
to answer was the* one suggested by the
hon, gentfleman from Victoria.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The hon, gentleman
has no right ta ref4r ta a past debate.
Han. Mr. POIRIER-It is the continuation of a debate. The point was that this
temperance law should emanate tram the
Dominion Government. I cannot agree
with him. As a matter a! f act, I take, the
reverse position. If the Dominion Government had sprung prohibitory iegislatian, I
would have taken the attitude that my hion.
friend frarn Moncton takes on this Bill. I
should have voted against it, nat that I
arn opposed ta ternperance-just the reverse
-but because surnptuary laws are of no
effect, unless dernanded and backed by the
people. Naw had the Governrnent at Ottawa acted upan the lines suggested by the
hon. gentleman tram Victoria, and passed
prohibitary legisiation. what might bave
Sorne of the provinces, no

doubt, would bave hailed such legislation
with satisfaction, but others would nat. It
would have been the central pawer impasing- surnptuary laws an sarne unwilling
provinces, with the result, as it bas been
at ail tirnes in histary, that the law
enacted would have been evaded by the

people. It is better in such cases that no
lsws shall exist, than a law that is flot
obeyed, or one that causes more disastrous
resuits than no law at ail. As it is now,
the piocess is the right one; the demand
for legisiation cornes from the provinces.
It started in the West. British Columbia,
I believe. adopted prohibition. Manitoba
and-Ontario passed prohihitory laws. The
temperance wave is now starting fram the
East. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island
and New Brunswick-in fact ail -the eastern
provinces except Quebec-have passed laws.
WVhat the Government is asked to do bere.
is not ta legisiate directly upoz4 prohibition,*
but to allow those provinces which desire
prohibition to earnestly enforce prohibition,
which they cannot do except by the intervention of the Dominion Government. I
repeat, I do not believe in forcing prohibition, any more than moral virtues, upan
the hearts, heads or brains of the people
through legisiation. But I may be wrong.
The provinces desire it. Since the provinces deaire it. let us give the provinces a
chance to effectively put it in force. It is

would be the consequences' There would

which has no prohibitory law. Quebec has
the right not to adopt prohibition, and
there would be this difficulty: people to the
west and to the east af Quebec couid not
be prevented from getting liquor fram the
country that is sandwiched in between.
Under such circumistances, the advocates
of temperance could say, and rightly say,
that they were nat given a fair chance to
carry out their law. The Government cornes

in faveur of prohibition for the province.
Although I do net want te compliment the
Goveaument on this legielation, I say
frankly that I think they are taking the
road et least reoistance. It wae not what
the temperance people asked or; they aeked
fer Dominion prohibition; stili I think this
legislation is in the right direction. It will
enable the provinces te carry eut their legielation; ceneequently it muet be a geod
thing. It ia legislation te w'hich little or ne
exception can be taken, because it can only
be applied where the people in a province
have paseed prohibition. Another thing 1
want te say in cemplimentary terme of the

all over the Dominion, a grf-at number et

part oc!the Parliament cf Canada, je bound
to take public opinion inte coneideration,
and public opinion bas been ezpressed in
ne uncertain veice se far as prohibition
ie cenoerned. 1 do. net know et any subjeet which bas public opinion se largely
in its faveur as prohibition. The province
ef Québec has been epoken et as an exmind
ception. I have ne doubt in my own
that if a plebiscite were taken in -the province ef Quebec in regard te prohibition, it
would be carried.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL-I have noticed that
hon. members who oppose this Bill do s0
largely on the greund that they are epposed
to prohibition. As bas aiready heen said
by corne hon. gentlemen whe have spoken,
if there is anything bas the support et
publie opinion throughout this whole country, it is prohibition. It may be that the
1
great majerity et 'the peop le are ail wrong
and that the members who believe that prohibition ie not in favour et temperance are

Hon. Mr. DANIEL-In the city of St.
John we have ne Scott Act; it is local
option.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-But you had
an election on the Scott Act in the city ef
St. John once or twice had you not?

Hon. Mr. WATSON.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-No, no.Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY-I should like te
ask the hon. gentleman bow was it in the
city of St. Jehn? Yeu had a plebiscite
there, had you net?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-At ail events I have
been se înformed by a very eminent gentleman, weil known te us al. who lias always
been a riesident of the province et Quebec,
wae breught up there, and to-day occupies,
I suppese, the highest judicial position in
the whole Dominion of Canada. Se far asmy personai view in cemeerned, I believe
in doing what the province ef Quebec has
done-that is, te leave this matter of prohibition te the municipalities et the province. At the same time, I do net intend
te oppose myself te what I believe te be
public opinion cf this country, which is
te my mind largely in faveur cf prohibition.
With regard te this particular Bill, it embodies a principle et law which 1 belleve
bas net been put in any other legisiative
enactment; that is, the principle ef making
a man preve his innocence instead ef the
ordinary principle et law whieh is that a
men is innocent until hie is proved guilty.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY-WUl' the hon.
gentleman allow me to put a queèt ion to
him? You had an election in the city of
St. John once or twice on the Canada
Temperance Act; howv did the vote go?

Hon. Mr. DANIEL-In éeveral wards of
the city of St. John no liquor is allowed
to be sold.

MAY 5, 1916
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY-That is ilot an
answer to =y question.
I asked yon if
you did not have an election under the Canada Temperance Act in the city of St. John
once -or twioe, aïd if the Act wu fot defeated.
Hon. MKr. DÂNIEL-I do not remember;
it may have been; 1 have neyer taken a
great interest in il.
Hon. Mr. MURPH[Y-What bas that to
do with it?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-I can te11 the hon.
gentleman this, that o far as selling liquor
is concerned in the eity of St. John, w.
have in sme wards the licenS system.
Under the provincial -law, any ward bas
the power to forbid liquor being sold
witb.in ils boundaries, and there are several
wards li the city of St. John in whieh no
liquor can b. sold.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-That la true.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL--The tendency there
bas been to reduee the number of licenseu,
and the number of licesises i. beig reduced froxi year to year.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-Exactly.
Hon. Mr. DANIiEL-In regard to the
whole province, so f ar as prohibition Ie
concerned it will affect but very few places.
I think there are only three or four places
in th. whole province of New Brunswick
where liquor is allowed ta b. uold. But 1
was reterring to a principle of law minroduced int Ibis Bill which 1 think is very
unueual, and 1 do not know that At has
been introduced mbt any other legisiation,
excepi legisiation of this character.
If a
man commite murder he is not conaidered
guilty until h. ie proved guilty, and oc
with regard t asny other crime, but under
clause 4 of this Bill a maxi is assumed to
b. guilty unless he proves hie innocence.
To my mind that is a very serions departure from th. ordinary principles on which,
without, being a lawyer, I have always
understood our legisiation ba. been based.
However, it is a matter that can b. r.ferred ta more fully when the House goea
lot committee on the Bill. From th. fact
tbat prohibition sentiment seemé to be
.sn general ail through Canada; no malter
what my own private 'sentiments. may be,
I feel il my duty to vote in favour ofaxly
,Bull which will enable tb. people to carry
out., Iheir wieh;

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-To my mind this
is not a question of prohibition; il
.las imply a quemtion of provincial
rights.
If a*ny province thixiks il in its
o'wn intereat to adopt'a measure more or
-leus prohibitory. with reference to liquor,
I think il would be the duty of every one
of us to help that province 10 carry out ils
own policy as 10 what they think is good
for, themselves. But 10 my mind il is not
o0 much a question ci prohibition as a
-question of provincial autonomy; and belonging te the Liberal party, I find no di!.
ficulty in supportmng sucli a measure. But
il il were a question of prohibition I would
atli vole for il. I do not know that I
would have don. that 10 years ago, because 10 years ago il did not seem 10 me
that public opinion was ripe for prohibition. But the very opinion invoked qgainal
Ibis measure, namely, that there is a strong
feeling of lemperance and il is neceasary,
ie the very reason why I arn compelled 10
vot. for it. -As there is a strong feeling in
favour, of prohibition T think il is Our duty
la help that movement on, and coxisequently I propose 10 *help Il by my. vote. The
question of conatitutionàlity was raised. I
do not think Ihat section 121 of the British
North Anierica Act furniahes any argument against constitutionality. That article bas nothini in view but the impositioin of a custorna- duty. :Prior 10 Confederation aeverai o! th. provinces had unquestionably the right, as betweena One
another, 10 have a tariff, and section
121 waa placed in the Act simply for
the purpose of domng away with lb.
right ta colleet duty on imports from
one province to another. We have unquestionably the rigbt la prohibit lbe
entry of goods, not oxily in Canada froro
foreign countries, but alio 10 prohibit the
iDterchange of goods from one province to
another. We have done il; we did it îme
years ago li tbe case of oleornergarine; I
canmot reoollect et the moment- of- -àny
oftb.r product the exchang -of- which was
prohibit.d in Canada, but ft is -,easily
conceivalble that w. might have a whole
lot of noxicus thàige which we, would

SHIPPING ACT AMENDMENT
BILL.
REPORTED PROM COMMITTEE.
The House resolved itself into a Coinmittee of the Whole on Bill (81), An Act
to amend. the Canada Shipping Act.
CANADA

(In the Commîttee).
On clause 1:
1. Sections four hundred snd forty-two, four
hundred snd forty-three 'and four bundred sud
forty-four of the Canada Shlpplng Act, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906. chapter one hundred
sud thirteen, with the heading Irnmediately
preceding section four hundred snd forty-two.
are repeaied sud the following sections and
heading are aubatltuted thereforPilotage District of Quebec.
PlotS sud Âpxrentices.
442. The number of pilota for th. Pilotage
District of Quebec shall fot exceed one hundred sud twenty-five.
443. Whenever the period of apprentioeahlp
of any apprentice under the Quebec Pilotage
Âuthority bas been interriipted by aicknesa,
]ROM. Mr. ECOVRT.

the minister of the department when introducing the Act made this statement:

By the. Provisions of the Act chap. 48 of
the Statutes of 1914. ail powers with respect
to pilota and apprentices. formnerly vested ln
the. Quebec Pilota Corporation, become vested
ln the Minister of Marine and Fisherles. It
wil therefore b. seau that section 442 is no
longer operative fer the same reason.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-That clause was
really substantially repealed before.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes. I will read
In the
testatuts to my hon. (riend.
statute of 1914 the hon. gentleman will firàd
chap. 48 gives to the niinister powers in
the pilotage district which include& the harbour of Quebec, and therefore dispenses
with the necessity ef re-enacting anything
in lieu o! 442. We will have 442 as it *appears in s he Bill.- We repeal those particular sections and enact 442 and 443 as
they now appear in--the Bill.- Section 442
defines the- number of pilote'in the Québec

MAY 5, 1916

district, and 443 deals with the question of
apprentioeahip. We stili adhere ta the
seae number of pilote.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Then we are only
new repealing clause 442 in .the Revised
Statutes?
Hon. Mfr. LOUGHED-Yes, we did not
repeal it before, but we teck ail the powera
that are incorporated in the old section
442 and vested them in the Minister cf
Marine, and the powers therefore auto-.
matically passed from the Pilotage Board
in the Quebec district ta the minister, but
now it ia desirable, for the purpose o.f placing the êtatutes- inx better shape, ta have it
repealed.
Hon. Mfr. DANIEL-It appears ta me that
if we are to vote intelligently on this new
section 442, wbich atatea that the number
ef pilota shall fot exceed 125, we ought te
have nmre idea ef the ainount cf shipping
that ia entering and leaving the port et
Quebec.
We eau take fi for granted,
probably, that the Miniuter cf Marine who
submits tii legialation knows something
about it, but te enable us te idge bow
many pilota are required tc perferm the
duties of the pilotage syatern in Quebec,
we should have some idea and nmre knowledge of the amount of business they have
te look after. 1 do net know whether the
gentleman who represents the Governmnent
here has that information, but it Would
enable us ta deal nruch more intelligently
with the clause if we bad it before us.
Hon. Mfr. LOUGHEED-I understand
this number represented the number cf
pilota when the matter was administered
by the pilota themmelves, and as hon. gentlemen will remember, it was contended,
when the former legisliation was before us,
that there was such an arbitrary administration et powers by the pilota themselve2
that it had become a very close corporation,
and it was utterly impossible te get witbin
its membersbip. I understand that the
Govern.ment is adhering ta a number whioh
wiil be sufficient for the purposes of meeting ail the shipping needs cf the pilotage
district in Quebcc, eand when my hon.
friend puts the question te me as ta the
tonnage, or volume cf -shipping, I cennot
givoe him that information. I have no
doubt h '-would be the subject matter cf a
return, and would involve very probably
exhaustive -labour in bringing it down.
Hon. Mr.*CASGRAIN-I have taken sme
interest ithfa Quebec pilotage question. 1

do net see anything objectienable in the
first clause. It prevides that when ea man
becomes a pilot he can makre the additienal
time ta cemplete bis seven years.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That ia the chief
feature of the Bill. 'Under the law as it
stands. four menths 'were ailowed'an àpprentice as an interruption, se te apeak,
in bis cotitinucus service, but if threugb
accident or any other cause, be exceeded
that four montha, he was prevented, from
becoming a pilot, and b.d ta start bis
seven years ever again. This provision bas
caused many cases cf bardsbip. The case
is instanced-particularly where an apprentiee bas ta igo abroad for certain instruction or certain experiene, aund on one cf
these voyages may be delayed beyond the
four menthe; wben he returna be finds
himself excluded from being practically
an apprentie. Re bas to atari ever again.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Tbis is te reeify
that condition of tbings.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes.
Hon. Mfr. DA2IFL-I have always
accepted the atatement refèrred te. by
the hon, leader of the Goverument, that
the Pilotage corporation of Qàuebea was a
very close corporation, indeed, and bad
viery stringent regulations, and naturally
the corporation would
like te bave
as amali a number cf Pilota as possible,
because it wouhd make the funda no much
the greater for each individual, and that is
the reason wby 1 was a little curious ta
Iknow whether 10 pilota were rea]ly a miiificient number to attend ta the business
cf the port. 1 assume that the Minister cf
Marine bas taken this matter ite consideration, and 1 understand now tac that
the minister bas sme control ever the
corporation whicb be did not bave formerly.
Hon. Mr. POWER-As I understand it.
the position is- this-and the bon, leader cf
the Government can correct me if I am
wrong--tbese sections, 'wbicb are suppesed
te be repealed, deal.witb the pilotage at
Québec, andi with the pilot. Then chapter
48 of the Act of 1914, atates:The Minutr of Marine Cand Flaheres, subject to the provisions of thé Cana"a Bhlpplng

Act saa have charge of the examninatIon.
licenalng, contrai and management c f pilota
and pilot apprentices, and the contrai and
mnuagement of pilot schooners, and no on.

that gave the minister. very'limited powver
because these; sections whichi we .are now
proposing. te repeal set -out' very minutely

SENATE
how many pilota there were ta be, and how
the pilot business was ta be conducted. and
consequently the miniater reaIly had almost
no power. He was tied up by sections 442
to 444, and I understand the object of this
Bill is ta give the m'inister a free hand, a
thing which I suppose was intended when
the Act of 1914 was passed. I presume that
th. intention waa then ta put the whole
matter in the hands of the Minister of
Marine and Fisheries, and to leave hum
unhampered by the provisions of these sections of the Canada Shipping Act.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That ia the case.
He can exercise his discretion.
One
hundred and twenty-flve is the number of
pilota provided for in the Shipping Act, but
section 443, which deals with tb. question
of apprentice, gives authority ta the minjuter ta permit the apprenties ta serve a
period equivalent ta that which. he has
lait, a that he may perfect his apprenticeship.
Hon. Mr. CASGRIN-There is a word
that is puzzling us on this aide cf the Hou.
In clause 2 there is a reference ta steain
engines with flash boilers, or by electricity.
Cauld the han, leader give us any information as ta that?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The House always relies upon my hon. friend ta keep us
posted on technicai questions cf that kind.
1 arn uuch .disappointed if he cannot
inform. the Houa. now.
The clause was adopted.
On clause 2:
2. Sectian six hundred and twenty-nine lu
amended by addlng the following subsection
thereto*2. Subject ta such regulations us may b.
made by the minister, this section shall fot
apply to any passenger ship flot exceeding

registered length ,proPelied by. an internal eambustion engin., or wlth a .steam engine with a
flash-boiler, or by electricity.
It has reference chiefly, I understand, ta'
gasolene boats.
Hon. -Mr. tMeLENNAN-In reference ta
the expression flash bailer, I may inform
the Houa. that il is like a steain mater

heated surface, and is instantly converted
into steain and capable cf explosion.
The clause waa adopted.

SECOND

PREADING.

Han. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading cf Bill No. 91, An Act ta amend
the Gaverninent Railways Small Claim8
Act. H. said: This Bill has as its abject
the extension ta Prince Edward Island of
the provisions regarding sinaîl dlaims that
now apply ta the Intercalonial railway.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I should like to
point out ta my hon. friend that this ia 'a
more extensive Bill than tb.at. Il seems
te me ta apply ta any railway in the central
and management of the Minister of Railways. Would it net apply ta that part cf
the Transcontinental which is now being
ôperated by the GovernmentP
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No, becaus. that
it not a Governinent railw.ay. 'The Goverument Railways Sinail Claima Act will gevern, I submit to the 'House, th. interpretatian which will be placed upon the legielation.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK-Is net tihat the fact
at the present lime, thai the Transcontinentai is under the control and management
of the Minister of Railways?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes. 1 flnd, as
my han. friend h as pointed out,. that it
will apply ta the. yrhole .Government railway system.

Hon. Mr. POWER-I have no doubt this
is ail ,right, but the cammittee should have
some little explanation of just *what it
means. I assume this is intended ta render
it unnecessary that a motor-boat of sinaîl

i. well that il should apply to jLll the Governmnt railways.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-When that Act was
passed in 1910 the Interoolonial railway
was supposed 10 include the Prince Edward
Island division, but nome dlaims were
taken to thie court, and the judge. i looking up the interpretation as te the Intercolonlal railway, found Ibat il only applied tb
the railways i thie provinces of Noya
8cotia, New Brunswick and Quebec. so that
the '.Prince Edward .Island railway did not
come under ils operation. Now, during
thosefour years a greal demI of disability
has been engendered by the Prince Edward
Island railway not being included, and
as an instance of it, those actions taken
in the fimali Debts Court for those smiall
dlaims were ne taide; the partie. w'ere nonsuited. In th. Commnons the other night
the members froin Prince Edward Island,
both Liberal and Conservative, endeavouréd
to have tbis measure made retroactive no
thal th. intention of Parliament at 1h. time
that 1h. Aet was passed should include
Prince Edward Island, and that the dlaims
arWrng between 1910 and th. present limie
could h. j>roceeded with and adjudicated
upop. For somes reason or other, I tbink
anore -as a mnalter of pique than anything
elle, the saniiter refused that which, 10
my mind, was a very reasonable amendment, and moved that th. committee rise
and lay the Bill amide altogether. However,
I se. that better counsel. prevailed and we
have lb. Bill h.fore us, but hon. gentlemen
ean readily understand thaï; an injustice
was doue-an injustice that was not ilended and that was againet the strict anid
absolute intention -of Parlianient at the
lime. Il seema to me only just and f air
that, having tbis Bull before us now, the
measure should be made retroactive so as
10 go back as far as 1910, making the law
apply ta the Prince Edward Island railway
as well as 1<>the main line of the Intercolonial railway.
Hou. Mr. YEO-I quit. agree with ail my
cohleague fromn Prince Edward Island haî
said. There is no doubt injustice ws.s donc
t0 parties on the island by th. omission of
Prince Edward Island ai 'the time the Act
vas am.nd.d. Il could net h-ave been intentional. It mnuet have been an omission.
and I can sec no juil reason why that
omission ihould not h. rectified juet now,
by. making the Act retroactive so far as the
Prince Edward Island railway in concerned.
I notice,.that,,a discussion teok place on
tbis .point in another part of tbis building

sme time ago, and the m'inister refused to
make the change. 1 do not know whether
the Senate would be inclined to make the
alteration now, but if they would, they
would only h. doing whaf is right and juil
to certain parties i Prince Edward Island
who have been prevenled from having their
dlaims adjusted by the court owing 10 an
omission fromn the Act when it was lent
amdhded.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-Would nlot the
dlaims be outlawed by this lime under the
Statute of Limitations?
Hou. Mr. MURPHIY-That is 6 years.
Hen Mr. SPROULE-The original law
having been pazeed in 1910, the 6 years
viun freen that lime to the present; but'
the câaims would likely have been contractedl some time before 1910, so thal Pv*-a
if tt>e law were made retroactive, if the
Statut. of Limitations i. the saine in Prince
Edward ]Island as in the other prov;n-ea,
1 do flot see thit the dlaims would b.
helped much if takein to 1he courts, even if
10-e iaW were rnae retroactive.

While 1he Statut. of Limitations ln our
previce is 6 years, you will se. that ail!
the elaims that have comes up since 1910
are valid, snd ual harred by the statuts.
[t would seem. to me only resonable that
the intention of Parliament, as il then
was, and as they thought they haed incorporated il i the statut., should be made
effective i this Bill. It is childish not
to accept sn amendiment of that kind.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-But my hon. friend
bas not shawn very c1leaily what the intention of Parliament was.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-The intention of
Parliameut may h. gathered from the fact
that in drafting the Bill in lh. first instance wîth regard ta these emali claime,
they. used th. words "Intercolanial raflway.". Well, Intercolonial railway. in the
generic sense, is supposed ta include, secording to th. lime-tables, the main line
af th. Intercolonial rsilway and th.
branches attached theret. as well s the
Prince Edward Island railway. That was
the intention of Parliament, and under
that law actions were ent.red iu Prince
Edward I.land 10 get remuneration for

cattie killed and damiages ara.sing, and the
judge, in looking up the interprýetatien of
the statute, found that it defined -Intercolonial railway" as that part of the Government railway estem run*ning through
the provinces cf Nova Setia, New BrunsIt .did flot include
wick and Quebec.
Prince Edward Island, -ad therefore the
intention of Parliament was nullifled, and
Prince Edward Island has been under that
disability ever ince.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Retroactive legislation in very objectionable but this case in
somewhat different from those which generally corne before sParliament.
If the
statements made by the hon. gentleman
behind me <Hon. -Mr. Yeo> and the hon. gentleman who lias just taken hie seat (Hon.
Mr. Murphy) are correct, and there in no reason for suppoming that they are not correct,
then it was'the intention of Parliament,
when 1he Act cf 1910 was passed, that that
Act should apply te the Prince Edward
Isand railwmy.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-Exactly.
Hon. Mr. POWER-And it seeme bo me,
if the Government are wiiling te take that
view. perhmps th. wiseat course would be
to allow the Bill te b. read a second time
and amended in committee te indicate that
the right to include Prince Edwmrd Island
i. sirnply declaratory of the intention of
th. -original Act. You could not then very
welli say that it vas retroactive legiuia-tion,
because Parlmment declares that the. intention cf Parliament in 1910 was that the
legislation should apply te Prince Edward
lâland.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-From the beginning.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I suppose. I assume
that the leader cf the Government would
have ne difficulty in making an atmendment
of that kind when the Bill goes into cernmitte.
Hon. Mr. DAIEL-I read the debate teferred te by the hon. members, both, cf
them from Prince Edward Island, and as

Hon. illr. BOSTOCK-I understood the

appointed by the Provincial Goverument
for the purpose of investigating the surrender of these tities; but as far as I have

question whether the Registrar General cf
Manitoba sheuld register the tities. That
was peculiariy a provincial matter.
Hon. tiMr. BOSTOCK-Could we not have
that information?
Hon. Mr. LOUOHEED-This Government
would net have the information official.
because it was a matter peculiarly uhder
the jurisdiction of te Provincial Government. I have made furtiter inquiry and
ame mformed by the Doputy Superintendent
Generai of Indian Affaira tat the Registrar Generai ef Manitoba yet refuses to recede in any way from the position whicit he
then took as to the registration cf the tities;
and it is with a view cf soiving the difficuity vrhict lias arisen that the Federai
Gevernment bas intervened and taken pro,eedings in thp -Exehequer Court for the
purpose of determining the question. because the Faderai Government itas alreadyý
issued the patents.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Are ail the patents

Hon. *Mr. LOUGHEED-The patents are

Government; se the Dominion Government
is practicalhy absoived in the matter. But
upon the presentation of these patents to
the Regietrar Generai, who is *the head of
that branch ef the registration service in

which the Government had issued. Now

BOUNTIES ON ZINC BILL.
SMO0ND PMAIDING.

Hon. Mr. LOtIGHEED moved the second reading cf Bill (94) An Act te provide for the paymenta cf bounties on Zincproduced from. zinc ores mincd in Canada.
He eaid: The objeet cf this Bill je te encourage the production of spelter. or zinc,
within Canada. Since the beginning cf the
war the price cf speiter bas gene up, as
hon. gentlemen are probalbly aware, te 30
or 40 cents per pound. The production hae
enormously increased. We have certgin
zinc depos "its in thc Dominion of Canada,
and in Trail, in the province cf Britimh
Columbia, sme development bas taken
place in the amelting cf zinc by thc chectrolytie procees. The object of t.hie bounty la
te promets the continuous development cf
that indiietry in Canada. There waa some
apprehensioa caine time &go that producers
in Canada would net b. warranted in expending any subetantial ainount o! money
in developing thc smelting induetry in this
particular.,produot except there was a distinct understanding with Uic Go'sernment
as te what thc future weuld be. It appeared
at the tixne that they entered upon this
enterprise that 'the war wouhd very speedihy
terminate, and that they wculd scarcely be
warrantcd in ent.ering upon aniy very large
operations in this particular business. The
Governinent made provision at the time
when they were approachcd that Uiey would
undertake te purchase a certain quantity cf
epelter at, I think, about. 15 cents per
pound. and would likewise make provision
by legialatien for the payment cf a bounty
until Juhy 31, 1917, if spelter eheuld f al
behow 8 cents a pound. There ie no prebability, I might say, of the Government
being called upon te pay this bounty. The
period expires on the 3lst day July, 1917;
that i. te say. the producer of spelter after
that date would not be entitled te the
bou4ty in question. The contract entered
ite by the Government with the company
in question bas pcrmitted cf the Government saving' something like 25 cents per
pound that they otherwise weuld have te
pay if they bought speiter ini Uic open
market for the manufacture cf cartridges
and other munitions; se, thc Govcrnment, by
thie legislatien,.,bas already more Uian reUc n. Mr. LOUGFiEED.

imbursed itself of the amount which it
would have to pay under any and ail conditions even if the law came into operation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Do 1 underetand
that the Government have entered inte a
contract with the Trail emelter to buy spelter at this price of 15 cents. a poundP
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, I think the
Sheil Committee is taking somewhere like
16,000 tons. The Government, by giving
them this order, bas been able to induce
them to enter upon their operations to the
extent that they have gene.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-16,000 tons at 15
cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There are two
companies producing zinc in Canada. There
is a company, I think, in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MoS WEENEY-I have not
heard of any in Nova Scotia. It muet be
Granby.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There are two
companies producing zinc in Canada. The
Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Trail, B.C.. and the Weldon Mining Company. of Quebec. The Governinent
has entered into a contract, or rather the
sheil committee was ena.bled te make a contract with the Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Company of 8,000 tons at a price
of 15 cents per pound, with an option upon
8,000 additional tons at a price of 12J cents
per peund. I might say that spelter, at
that particular time, was selling for 40
cents a pound in the PUnited States, but
owing te the promieed legisiation they were
enabled to make very favourable contracte.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I suppose there will
not be very mueh bounty paid under this
Bill, as the price of cpelter is hiable te
keep up 'until the 3lat July, 19W~. I notice.
on cemparmng -this Bill with other Bis of
the same na.ture, euch as the Lead Bounty
Act passed soîne time ago, that there was a
difference in the wording of it. In this particular Bill no provision is made as teo where
the money je te go. When we were dealing
with the question cf lead bounties it was
specially speoified that the beunty.-should
be paid te the preducer cf the lead, but al
that this Bill saye in the second clause ie
that the Governor in Couneil may authorize
the paynient, etc. It does net say te wbem
it is te be paid.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That mighteasily
be inferred.

Hou. Mr. LOUGHEED-Oh, no. To any
one producing the zinc.
Hon. Mr. BOBTOCK-It might lie that
other companies would put iu an application for bounties. It le flot tied up any way
ta that perticular company?

There are certain cases where a punishment of tbhat kind might be of value; that
is, if you are dealing with ânen 'wh> carry
on what le known ais a floating 'bar, where
they have not any property ta get et beyond
the clothes on their beck, and where they
are lier. to-day snd, away tomorrow; but
im the, case of a brewery or distillery, where
there are higli penalties asthere are ini
those cases, I would think that the penalty
al-one is quite sufficient without this extraordinary clause, providing for the, cancellation of their license. I move that that
clause is etruek out of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-It aeems ta -me that.this is not et all vindictive legislation. Âs
hon. gentlemen are well aware, penalties
for violations of tii. Liquor Act are usually
heavy. The Dominion Government ia endeavouring to tae. a etep ta. help the Provincial Government ta enforce their prohibitory *clause. and this a ~the. main. lever

addition Wothat ail the liquora are le be

sufficient punishmni te the brewer and
distiller as. well as to the retail dealers.
Why ahould we go on and, in addition to
that, provide that the brerweT's license shail
be suspended for three months if he offends against clause 1. There are large
numbers of men employed ini breweries and
distilleries, and if you close up an establishment of that kind forthree montha,
the-effect on the men employed, as well as
on the brewer or. distiller, is very serions,
and 1 shail be very happy. to iupport the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. MURPHEY-Those brewers, or
distillera, are men of very ample meaus, and
they can with great ease ahip their gooda
int a province where there is a prohibitory
law.. or any aLlier kind of law for the suppression of the liquor traffic. - They are
men hard te get at. Evidently, when Ibis
enactment wau being made ail -those thinga
were being considered, and the necessily
of clause 2 fully brought out. We have had
a prohibitory law for soins 16 years, and
therefore are li a position te undersland
how bard it isate safeguard the inleresta o!
temperance froni oulside inter! erence. ln
eur experience cf the prohibitory law, in
Prince Edward Island, the proximiîy of
New Brunswick and Nova &cotia bas
greatly interfered witb its strict enforcement. and I contend that Wemakeé this Bill
be
effective, il requires Wo very drastic, and
that when a brewer contravenes ils provisions two or three limes, his -license
should be cancelled.

Hon. Mr. WATSON-I do not agree with
the conclusion of the hon. gentleman from
Halifax and the hon. gentleman from St.

and are the men that would be interested
in violating the law by shipping mnto another province. I thin-k Ibis bas been very

sanie principle embodied 'ini the Canada

ciple of evidence is necessary for tbe proper
carrying out of the Act, and I Ibink I amn
justified in saying that-.no bon. gentleman
can point te any particular case in which a
hardship has been brougbt about tbrough
Ihis principle of evidence being embodied
in an Act, or through its being invoked by
the proper authorities. This Act which we
are now considering ia of the sme dlas of
legisiation as the Acta te which I have already referred, and I subseit with every
confidence that tbis principle o! evidence
should enter jute the provisions made -for
the proper carrying out of the Act.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton)-Tbose hon.
gentlemen who were here the other day
when Ibis clause was under discussion will
remember tbat I referred te the Inland
Revenue Act and pointed out that there
was one section in that Act which provided
that a defendant should be called upon te
exculpale biseef. I1 aiso pointed out why
that could not be considered as being unfair, on accourit o! the marks that the Inland Revenue Departîment put upon the
gooda that pass through the bands of theofficers. There is no hardship i that case.
nor is there any hardship in the other
cases te which the hon. leader of the Government has referred where a mean bas
goods in his possession on which he dlaims
te bave paid the customes duty; il ia tbe
easiest thing in the world for bise te pro-duce bis éheque book and show Ihat
evidence.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton)-Bat the
citation of those Acts is really no justification for what we say is- a serious injustice in Ibis Bill. My complaint yester-day, and today, is not that a mean may be
called upon to prove bis innocence, but
Ibat this section calls upon bise te prove
mometbing that be bas no means of kno'wing
snything about. Take the specific case
which. I gave you, o! a merchant wbo sold

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Suppose that under this clause a man were
accused of selling liquor improperly, and
ho made affidavit that he had reason to
believe that ho was selling it for legal purposes. wonld not that b. evidence?
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton>-Not under
the wording of the Act.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I read
the Act and considered it frose the
same standpoint as my hon. friend and
the question arome i my mmnd whether a
mean accused of having illegally sold liquor,
could possibly.. -in many cases, furnish any
evidence bul ',bis .own declaration. The
case in Vancouver bo which my hon. friend
refera. if he maide solemn declaration that
he sold that liquor for lawhxl purposes, it
seema te me that ahould be sufficieý1t evidence. I cannot understand what other
evidence ho could possibly give. There is
another case te which my hon. friend calis
attention; that is that an ignorant magistrale might punish a man improperiy. I
do not know how It is in the other Provinces, but i Ontario a mean accused of
à crime must be 1used before a Police
magistrale, or a stipendary magistrate, who
bas the power individually te conviot or
send that, man te j ail. If an ordinary masgistrate bears a cee and convicts a man, it,
is an illegal conviction, consequently the
man is released. I may as weil make a
free confession that a great number of
years ago. when the police magistrale of
our city was absent, a boy committoed many
depredations and his poor mother coseplained very bitterly because he was not
pirnished. Unfortunately for mue, altbough I
had been a magistrate for thirty or forty
years, I took the case in hand and sent
the young rascal te a reformatory. I subsequently ascertained that I had committed an illegal act, as the sèntence was one
which. could only be imposed by a stipendary, or police magîstrate. In the province
of Ontario such magistrates would not, I
arn sure, be guilty of that whichbhas been
attributed to ignorant and illiterate magietratea.

Hon. Mr. POWER-As the hion. members
from Middleton <Hon. Mr. Rose>) and Monterville <Hon. Mr. Beaubien) pointed out,
these cases axe not similar to this. case.
The importer of goods who goes to the calstoms dioua. pay bis money and gets a. receipt if h. vishes if,. Ir~e bas him check and
fhe.rnvoice. and eu establish hie innocence
vithout trouble. But under the operetion
of this Bill, if it beoomes law, the dealer
in Montreal vho ahipu goods to British
Columbia has not suoh evidence 10 furDish.
The lion. gentleman referred toi th. Canada Temperance Act, and I think he intimated that I lied supported that measure.
That reminds me of a thing Iliat. happened
a greal many yeere ago, before any other
menator nov prement was a member cf the
Senate. When the Canada Temuperanod
Act was going through 1he Senete I vas a
very junior member. I had been reeently
appointed tô th. Senate mnd vas nalurally
disinclined to do anything unfriendly. to
1he Govenaienl whioh had reoently appombted me. -I remnember that vhen this
Canada Temperance Act wem under conideration Ibere vere a great many things
in il that. I did not like. ,However, I mat

clause-and I think that la the very clause
10 'whic-h 1he bon. gentleman bem Teferred,
resembling the on. in 1he Bill before usthat I couid not relly swallow. 2401 wishing to vote againal the Government, I got
up and left the, chamber. I took to, 1he
woods.. So that I do not think I cen h.
very strongly criticised for the view I taire
of tbis malter now: but there la one point
tbat I 'do not think sufficient' stress has
been laid upon. In 1h. case of tihis Bill,
the brewer, or distiller, or wholesele dealer
in Montreal le not ini tb. position of a man
who gels his goods lhrough 1h. customs, or
through 1h. Inland Revenue office. The
brewer or dealer in Montreal la in the position of the, exporter in Great Britain. When
goods go throupb the customa houa., can
you tackle the dealer or the exporter ini
Great Britain and compel him 10 prove
that hie knew that those goods lied not been
smnuggled int Canada? Everyone cen se.
that tihat ie not the case.
Hon. Mr. BOSS .<Middleton-In reply to
th. thon. gentlemen 'fren Belleuille, I mey

whether the House bas arrived at the

Nobody will say that the Parliament shouid
do that. But what dees it do? IL gives power
to the Railway Board te supersede the decision of Parliament. This clause subjects
Parliament te the last decision of tbe Railway Board. I cannot understand how Parliament can pass such a law. Hon. gentlemen know that every Lime a Bill of this
kind has been brought before us I have
always opposed it, and those Bills were less
dangerous than this Bill, which goes further in the way et depriving Parliament of
its rights and powers.

for a second offence, te the suspension of his
Uicense for any period flot exceedlng six monthe,
and on conviction for a third offeuce, shahl forfeit hie license aud shall thereafter be unable te
hold such a license.

Hon. Mr. DANDUBÂND-I voted for the
motion tu stzrike cut clause 2, because I
flt tint tiere was a danger cf the. clause
working an injury tu people, wio might
be condemned periaps accidentalhy, or b.cause of a divergence cf opinion, or where
there was conflicting evidence in eome
part.cf our country. Condemnalion umder
such tircumatances would entail considerable loss and dislocation in business by
the, suspension cf a license. Feeling strongly
in that direction, I voîed for the striking
out of the clause. Now we muat net loue
dight cf the fact liaI thia clause -adds a
penalty tu other penalties that .are imposed
by celaus4e 1. 1 have ne objection that a
lurlier penalty siould reach th. violator
cf the law, *wio is clearly guihty and acte
in suci -à way as tu lead le tie conviction

that be has no respect for the law. I arn
not dinposed tu add a penalty aller the arst
or second conviction, even when it would
b. questionable if the party should be vieited with a much heavier penalty than the
one irnposed in the firaI clause. For that
remsn, 1 arn redy to retrace rny eteps tu a
certain extent, but not tu the extent cf
voting tu restore clause 2 as moved -by
my b1oe. ,friend from Portage la Prairie.
What 1 arn dieposed tu do I shail embody
m the amendment which, I moye, seeonded
bYH]Eon. Mr. Bostock; it il:
Tlat the lines 17, 18, 19 and 2.0 of that
clause 2 b. erased.
So that this -clause 2 will be limited tu
auspending the license cf the brewer or
distiller convicted of having 1violated the
law and condemned for violation cf 1he law
twioe. NOn the. third offence the brewer or
distiller would loue hi. license present
and thereafler. With this amendment to
,clause 2, Ibis Charnier will maintain
the principle of a severe penalty being
imposed upon a violator of the law, when
il in made clear liaI fie has a complete disregard for 1h. la*- In virtue of clause 2.
afler the first conviction hi. business may
b. suspended for 1hree montha. Well, to
suspend a country-wide business, euch as
thaI cf a brewer or distiller, for three
moDthe is tu force that business int bankruptcy. Itlei a dislocation, a paralysis cf
the business for tire. monthu. The penalty for a second offence, suspending the
license, paralyaing the business for six
months, is cf course increasing th. risk of
considerable loss. But I arn ready to add
the. penalty cf taking away the license
when there have been two consecutive convictions registered against the. offender; but
we muet net forgel tiaI sales take place by
tie hundreda in a month or a week, aud
that a man conducting his business in perfect good failàh may be hiable 10 b. fined a
thousand miles from his place of business;
and on conviction by a justice of the peace,
and the simple registration of liat conviction, his business would be paralyaed
for tirée months. It seems to me that there
is considerable danger cf an in-justice being
done, and for tiat purpose I move this suiamendînent.

otherwise, 'but it seema to me that the penalties piovided by 'clause 1 are quite suffidient for -the case ef the breweîs and distillera as well as the retail dealers. It has

was unawaîe that he was violatîng the
law. Il has been brought out that under
the aperation of this law, a man in one
province sending liquor to some other
province hais ta be in a position ta
tuake it certain -that lie will know exactly
-what becomes of «that liquor alter i l a

la accused of committing an offence, he
cen swear he did not know and did not believe that this liquar was ta be used in an
improper way. But 1 do not mee that it is
g3ing ta help him very much. Under certain circumatances, h. might be convicted
and convicted before a magietrate, and m
I would consider ihat the penalties in clause
1 are quite sufficient. But if, as I said
before on another Bill, compromise is advisable, I would muoh prefer the suhamendinent of the hon, gentleman fram De
Lorimier ta the remesertion of the clause.
Hon. Mr. DOM VILLE-I cannot allow
my hon. friend 10 take his seat without
asking hiru ta retract bis statement that
they hang people i Et. John, froru which
place he cames. I did not hear him take
it hack; if he did so I have nothing further
to say. My hon. friend, like myseîf. neyer
takes a drink; therefore we ought bath ta
vote ,for. prohibition, unlcss somebody treats
us. But I do not think -the city of Et. John
will 'Lhank him for stating that they hang
people there for stealing a loal of bread.
Tider such conditions my hon. friend could
-cail for everybody down there ta be hanged.
To-ay they do not caîl it -stealing, they
cail it taking advantage of their opportunities. This legisiation would be aIl right
for Prince Edward Ieland; they have tried
prohibition for two years, 'but you cen. not
kcep them sober, and they should prevent
liquor from going inta that island.
Trhe House divided on 'the sub-amendment, wh.ich was adopted. on the !ollowing
division: Contents 27, non-contents IL
The motion ta reineit clause 2, as amuended, was then agreed to.
Hon, Mr. LOUGHEEED-I ishould like ta
see clause 4 of the Bill reinstated. As was
pointed out yeeterday, for the proper enforcement ai this Act clause 4 is absolutely
neceissary. It has been found in ahi legislation of thie charzacter 'that the anus of
pioaf must be upon the party alleged. to

that operation ha. not proved an injustice
to any pereon who has beein charged with
contravention of tihe law. It has been
pointed out to me since ycsteiday that the
eliminatian of this clause froma the Bill
would prove destructive to a proper or boneficial enforcement of the -Act
Several han. GENTLEMEN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Under those circumatances, I therefore feed justified in2 appealing to the House 10 support the principle of the Bill. The object of Parliament,
is ta make the provincial legisiation effective, and if we rob the Bill of tihe
machinery which is calculated to make its
enfoi'cement auccessful, we might as well
rejeet the whole Bill.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-Hear, hear; rejeet it.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I therefore appeal
ta bon, gentlemen for the restoration of the
clause.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I should like ta
ask my hon. friend if he proposes to make
sny motion in regard to- clause 5 as well?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I had flot itended doing so, because clause 5 is entirely separate from clause 4, and if clause
4 is given ta us I shaîl accept the already
expressed decision of tihe Chamber on
clause 5.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY-I have just remesobered that I. was paired with the hon.
senator from 4Montreal, Mr. Wilson, and I

Hon. Mr. WVATSON-There is no record.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-1 should like ta ask
the hon. minister in oharge of! this Bill
what will be done- in dealing with a case
af this kind:. A dealer in Halifax violates
the law through somebody in Vancouver;
the offence is committed in Vancouver;
who is going ta deliver the suinmons ta

you would have ta pay for the cattle car.
You have ta treat him as a gentleman.
Who is going ta pay the expenses of that
man? Who is going to pay the expenses
of the witnesâes ta be brought from Halifax
te Vancouver? Because the magistrate in
VazScuver cannot make ont a case without
hearing bath aides; he cannot deliver judgment. This law je an upheaval of ail prin<eiples of criminal procedure. Now, these
are fair questions put ta the Government
belore they tesk any intelligent body ta endorse a measuré of this kind. 1 amn not
attacking -the principle of the Bill; 1 amn
attacking the methods whereby we enforce
the principle8. The question 1 em putting
ie a practical one, a fair one; je it the
municipality where the violation of law is
cammitted that is ta pay ail those expenes, or the province, or the Federal
power? I think the Government oughit ta
give this information before aeking the
Senate ta stultify iteelf in this matter.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The question
submitted by my hon. friend je a very fair
one, and I ehaîl be very glad ta anewer it.
My hon. friend entirely mieconceives the
purpait of this clause in the Bill. The offence alleged wlll take place at the point
where the shipment, je made. and the prosecution muet there take place. In the
case cited by my hon. friend, that ci a
shipper shipping liquar from -Halifax ta
Vancouver -easeming there je a prohibiti'on law in British Columbia-the promecution would. take place in Halif ax; consequently a man le not removed from where
hie livee, hie will be prosecuted where hie
lîves, and there je no hardship in a case of
that kind. It ie only nder clause 5, as-suming that we had passed clause 5, that
the alleged injustice would take place, and
that clause bas been stricken ont.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Allow me ta finish
my question. You have deait now with the
dealer; the expenses will not be incurred
from Halifax ta Vancouver; the offence je
in Halifax. The only people who can prove
that' offence are the people in Vancouver.
Who is going ta pay the bailiff and the attorney and everybody else ta travel to Halifax and appear againet the accused there?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-The bailiffs and attorneys there.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-But who je going ta
pay the expenee?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-The local Government down there.
Hon. Mr. CDORAN.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The law does not
say sc. Who is going to pay the expenees
of bringing witnesses -and prosecutors al
the 'way frorn Winnipeg ta Halifax to
prosecute those who violate the law? I
think the country ie entitled ta know that.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I think the hon.
gelatleman will flnd his answer in clause 8.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY--Clause 8 is cut out.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-No,'it je carried.
Hon. Mr. WÂTSON-It ie not out. Read

Hon. Mr. POWER-Clauee 8 was not

of the Government ie alightly ini error when
hie mays that the prosetcution eshould take
place at the point of shipment. Take the
firet clause:

I have said, having to send forward a
greater contingent than -probably 25,000,
and when it was auggested nme time age
by the Prime Minister that Canada should
increase its quota up to haif a million men,
publie sentiment at once approved of the
proposai then made. Up to fhe present time
we have mobilized substsntially over 300,000, with every probability of reaching the
500,000 limit at a comparatively early
period. Under these circumatances. Parliament cannot be surprised that it has been

Hc«L Mr. CHOQUETTE

1MAY 11, 1916
I.cdaim this is not even a Bill deaiing
with the property and land revenues ai
the Orown, because it does mot pretend te
alienate or dispose oi the. lande ai the
Crown. That lias alreedy been donc in virtue of a general Act wiiich, did nat need any
confirmation by «Parliamonft. IL bas bewe
deme ta the. extent-tiat lettera patex-t have
been grant.d by the Orown in vîrtue of a
generai law. The. titie, the. sale, ha. been
complcted and conflrmed by the. Orown i
granting ita patenta. Tiie owners, the.
purchiasers, wisi te have 4those patents r.gistcr.d. They are the owners, having paid
their meney. Tii. Crown doos* not corne
hore, -and do.. not need te cerne here, ta
eoufirm tiiat titi.; it oniy cernes ",r te
ask that upon the payment cf saupplementary dollar, the parties may have a
apeciai confirmation of a titi. whicii the.
Crewn bas attacked. Ba that practically
this.Bill hma for its principal object the. settling o! a dlaim whioii the. Crown sets up
befor, the. tribunal., attaeking the. validity
of fts own titi.. This is a Bill te removo
t'h. eiaud of doubt whichi may extat on a
titi. already grant.d I viztue af the law,
whieh does nat need any cnfirmation;
but by the. fact and by the acte of the
Orown ontesting- that claim before a -tribunal, itthurna te the Purchaser and Baya,
'You may have yaur peace and a contfrmation ai that titi. by payrng a dollar."
Now there would. b. a reasen for the. Crown
coming te Parliament te ask te discharge
a mortgage on a property if we admitted
the. principle that is eontained in the. Bill,
that it ta necesaary for the, purchasors te
pay that furtiier dollar.
If we admitted the. principhe and allowed
this transaction te go, and the. purchaser
te, psy that supplementary dollar, *or bind
himseîf by mortgage on bis praperty te
psy that dollar, what would happen> Tii.
mortgage having been giron, -a lien would
exist an the. property, and then I understand the Government would need te get
aupplementary powers from lii Parliament
te diacharge that lien; but there wull b.
ne lien if this Parliamenit decides that it
is opportune te confirm -th. titi. without
any aupplcmentary money being paid.
Thia ia not a Bill for the purpose ai empowering the Gavrnment to dispos. of
lands. Notet haI. Tiie disposai ha. taken
place, the purchase money bas been paid,
the titie ha. heen handed te the. purchaser,
and the. transaction te complet.. Now the
Government cornes and saya, " Inasmucii
as we 'have put a cloud on liat title by
challenizins its validitv bv an action in

court, we now ask, the purchaser -consenting-because h.e is flot obl*iged te* do
so-Lhe payment of that dollar~ that
we give hi'm a confirmation of title,
and if the. owner bmnde himself te
pay at a future date, we wili take
a mortgage. and we ask by this Bill te
ho enabled te disciiarge that lien; but. if
we decide that tiiee ia no n.ed for the. confirmation- of the. titi., tAlen there i. net
even a shadow of deubi as te thi. n.eossity
cf this Bih .coming belore Parliament. We
can reWet tihe Bill in toto and the partiee
would remain witii their val-id titi., the
land having pasod cempietely Le the. purchaser; or the Gov.rnment having raised
a suspicion as ta the vàlidity of the. titie,
we may say, 44Well, it is -in order that the.
firet part of clause 2 may ho adepted, and
the patent deciared valid and confirrned."
This te net a Money -Bill.

te go ite the history ai tisi Bill at any
length, but it seeins te me thore are two
or three tliincs whicii determine wtiether
tho Bill la a Money Bill or net. The
first ls how it is introduced. If it is a
Money Bill it siiould be introduced by
resolution; and the second is, doea -it affect the. revenu,, or doeos it affect property
that is usually under centrai ai and handied
by the. Crown. Dealing with that phase ai
it, I noticed, looking thia up for a moment,
soe cases that were citedl in theo paat.
One ta with regard te the proposai ai an
amendment made by the Senate te a Bill
which carne from the Hanse ai Commons,
in whicii it was propoaed te giv. a larger

hou. friend ta, ask that legisiation cf this
eharacter b. enacted. But that is flot
even uecessary. If the provinces desire ta
enset any prohibitory, or partial prohibitry I.av, they have, -under the decision
of the Privy Council, paver ta prohibit the
manufacture cf liquor vrflhm the boundaries cf the province; s o f ar as may hé necessary for th., purposes o! provinçial legisIatioii. ?In 'à,case which vas known as the
Provincial. Prohibition.case, vhich vent ta
the Privy Council, I -thinak il vas in 1896,
the- question v'as 'asked the Privy Couneil:Has a Provincial Legislature jurisdiction to
prohihit the manufacture of sncb liquors in
the::province' The ansver* of -the Privy
Counefi to that question waa: "'The coinmittee say that there may be circumstances
in vhich a Provincial Legisiature might
have jurisdictiou ta prohibit thxe manufacture within the province of intoxicating
liquors sud the.irnportatîou cf such liquars
iute the province," Thapt is to Bay, the doctrine lias been laid down and is accepted
by us ini ail legisiation, that for th. purpose of carrying eut tbe enacîmnenl cf the
province, the province lias authority ta enact legialation against the manufacture, s0
far as the mnanufactu-re is ancilliary ta their
legisiation. Iunan part cf ihe Dominion cf
Canada have the pr ovinces gone even as
ft as that, nor have they exercised their
paver to the extent indicated by thxe Privy

Hon. Mr. POWER-It is contended by

gentlemen in this House who say: "We

our sympathy goes to the speculative buyers who are going to make a lot of money
out of it." I do nat think it ie right, and
my sympathy je with the Indiana.
Han. Mr. DAVIS-Il thé Government aympathisea with thé poor Indian, and the
Indien officiais made a mistake, why do
they pénalise the purohaserB?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-The people are quite
willing to pay it--glad ta, pay the extra
dollar.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED -We have taken up
a very considerable time in dieussing the
question of surrender. I do not think there
can be any question as to the irregularity,
at least, of the surrender; it certeinly was
irregular under t1m Indien Act, because the
Indian Act, je moat explicit. There mu.st be
a mejority of the band, flot a majarity of
those presen4. Now a settiement has been
effected through ail parties concerned, and
that settiement, bas been arrived at aiter
very considérable negotiatiains. The motiement, so far s r cen aucertain from Ihe correspondence. originated quite as muoh with
the purchasere ka8 with any other persan.
The solicitors for the purchasers suggested
ko the Governmeii that they acoept a dollar
au acre, and that Oàs4 législation ib. brought
dawn; caneequently that ie arranged. Arrangement bas alao been snede ko withdraw
the proceedings in the Ezchequer Court.
This je ail ta operate as a settîcinent of the
proceedings. Now, my hon. iriend je not

good set ko tle purchesers in diaturbing this

friend thet, except this legislation goes
thraugb, the metter remneins tied up. The
Regiatrar General af Manitoba, who je the
officer of the provincial gavernment, will
refuse ko issue the oertificate of titie ko the

now thst the Dominion Government will
not proceed ko validete the proceedings by

not justified in leaving the impressio n that
$,he Féderal Government is in any sense
a party to the transaction which took place
between the Provincial Government and
the Ki'tsilano Indiana, any more than the

seems to me that if the reveréionary right

the Indians, -that the provincial authoritiez
would have the riglit bo negotiate with the
aurviving Indiana of any particular tribe

to be an iflogical position te, take, that

upon the extinction cf ail the Indiana with
the exception of one, the Provincial Goçvcinment oould net deal wibli that one, or
could not deal with a greater number as to

to be but a H-fe intereet which they have ini

arisen byreason of the Indiana being upon
reserves in localities. where it je desirable
that those reserves sbould be surrendered
and other lande given to the Indiana. I
have no doubt that when that report ie
prepared it will be brought befoire Parliament~, and the most ample opportunity will
b. given to ail concerned fer fuliy diseuseing it with a view te, arriving at a satisfactory determination of the whole asbject.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK-May I be ailowed
to say that thie agreement 1 have here is an
arrangement, of course, between this Government and the Provincial Government.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-But I do. not underetand anything i that te, be necessarily
repugnant to the statement which I have
made, that there je a reverfsicnary right ini
the provincial authorities, and the right of
the Indiana can be ertinguished by sale or
by a mutual agreement between the Indiana
and the provincial authorities. Because
the worda -"sale of the reserve " »are used,
it doés not neceesarily foilow that they
muet be interprêted to, mean that the arbitrary, condition can only a îrise of the provincial anthôrities having an interest in
the reserve upon the abeolute extinction of
the last member of the tribe.
Hon. Mr. BOST4XIK-No, but perhaps I
did not mnake myseif quite Iclear. The
Premier of British Columbia apparenitly
takee the stand that, arieing out of the ai- «
bitration, the money that is to be paid to,
the province is te, be paid for the reversion
of the title. As I underetand, ail the money
coming eut of theze expropriation proceedings will be paid over to the Dominion
Giovernment as trugtees for the Indiana.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED)-Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-And therefore, according to that, the Premier of British
Columbia was hardly correct when he made
the statement that the province was bound
to be paid the $300,000 at leaet, and he wae
confident tliat the arbitration proceedinge
would fix a much more substantial amount;
so the province was thoroughly protected,
and the property would become a public
utility of great value.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No doubt about
that. My hon. friend 'wvill observe that the
Federal; Government, being a trustee for
.the Indiana, and- ini whom the legal'estate'

This Bill vas discussed at some lengh on

arguments vhich I made i support of the.

the -large majority of the. Houiè. 1 need
onily say that the amendment vas,- to my
mind, reasonable, and designed to redresa
a grieyazice and mn injustice mider vhich
several claimants ini my province laboured.

Befôre 1 arn through -1 shall read letters

and who are aise i faveur of restrieting the. appeal. I have here a memo heom
the Hon. Edward Blake, dated flth October, 1875. 1 may say that 1 have aise
taken communication of Mr. Blake's
speech i the Hansard, on the -Bill te
establish a Supreme and Exohequer Court,
and aise a remarkable speech, which, I
would commend te the membere of this
House, an appeal by Edward Blake te members on the Australian Court Bill, which
will be found i the Gommnons. Hansard,
May 2lst, 1900. On that occasion Mr. Blake
diew a parallel between the constitution of

more. autonomy than the constitution that
coeuntry. The varieujs
now.governe tis

cf. the. Commonwealth o! Australia. That
constitution had been prepared by the
Australian people themacîves, and when it
came before the Imperial Parliament, tbe
very clause which je the burden cf my
remarke now, whether there should be an
appeal from lhe Supreme Court o! Australia te lhe Judicial Committee o! the
Priv.# Council, the Bill was about te be
withdrawn, when a compromise was effected and the Bill became iaw. Mr. Blake i
speaking on this subject on the 21st May,
1900, used these words i order te depiet
the nature cf the constitution cf the
Commonwealth of Australia:
This creatur. (the. Commonwealth of Auetrglia' ham net been conceiyud Ini the wemb of

That-was addressed te the tien Governor,
and 1 only quote a few passages here and
Af ter arguing that tie Bull was
there.

within the rights of Canada he said:
It la tiieretere abundantly manitest that. for
a great number ot years the~ Provincial Legisture have, witiieut remonstrance, exercised
the power et determining that tiie judgment of
the~ provincia courts shall b. final ln ail thoïe
cases (comprieing the large majerity eft hq
whol. number of cases tried> in whicii tii.y
thought It was fer the publie advatage that
tiiere abould b. no appeal beyond the. provincial courts.

And Mr. Blake goes on and adds:
If the. law, as expound.d by any court, however higb, 414 net meet the. publie exigenclet.
the Provincial Legiulature alter.d the, law ln
eider te remedy the. defect and what the~ Provincial Legialatiire ceuld Itsf legiaiatively expound wutiont appeel, It had the rtgbt te declare .aiould b. by Its own courts judiclaly« ex-

And I give as- evidence of that lhe
famous Roy case, Cenadian Pacifie Railway vs. Boy.. wiere a farmer had hie barns
burned by a spark from a locomotive cf
the Canadien Pacific.- railway. The case
was won. 1 believe, i Canada, but lest in
the. Privy Council i England, and what
was the consequence? At the very next session of the Quebec Legislature the Iaw was
amended i eder te provide that i future
decisions cf that nature siould. net b. reversed by the. Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council. Later on, within twe or
three years, another case arose in which
lhe present Pestmaster General was an advocate. That was a case in wWhc a certain
mnan by the. name of Cotton had died, and
hie estate had te pay succession duties in
another province or in another country.
Having paid once, they dlaim ?d that they

why should the>' not have the right to declaie that their own courts should decide

the cases? More of Mr. Blake:
U7hls charter belnig granted under the &uthority of an Act of the Imperial Leginlature

The assurance of your adisers (and I may

Hon. Mr. CÂSGRAIN.

That is in answer to Mr. Belcourt saying
that in England, or here, every suitor has
access to the foot of the Throne and cau
submit his dlaim there. That right does
not exist; the Throue always administers
through the courts of law, and there la no
case for centuries back where the King lias
interfered in any way with the courts. Now
here is an important statement in Mr.
Blake's memorandum, which deals with
local prepossession- which means that our
judges *would Ïbe impartial:
The quotation ktates that the appeal removes cases from the influence of local prepoessessions.
This can only mean that the
Impartial administration of justice is flot accomplished In consequence ef these se-called
local prepossessions. That 1 muet deny, believing, as I do. that justice Io impartially administered In Canada. It ls true that caes
are by this appeal, remnoved beyond the Influence of local knowlcdge, of local experience.

0f that learning and training. flot strictly legal
which is yet essential to the formation of a
uound Judgment
These are, unquestionably
very great disadvantages. Au Lord Brougham
said. lThe jurisdiction extends over varions
countries, peopled by various mates, differing
widely in habits, still more widely In privileges,
great In numr. . .. and from. the moe distance of the colonies. and the-immense varlety

le that hardi>' any two of the colonies can Ile
named which have tac nosae iaw; and in the
greater number, the law is wholly unlike our
own." These difficulties certaiflly far more
than counter-balance tac alleged. advantsge of
a freedom from local prepossessions.

It simply says that even if our judges
were a littie bit partial in certain caseswhich is denied-still their intimate knowledge of our usage and customs and se on'
would make them better judges of our cases
than people across the water, who do not
know very much about it except what they
hear from the lawyers in each case.
An Imperial Act was pasaed iu 1791 dividing Quebec iute Upper and Lower Canada:.
Provided for the making and cffect of local
laws and for a Local Court of Appeal, subi uct
to the like appeai therefrein as formerly existed.
Ibut subject nevertheless te such ether provision as might be made In this behaîf by Local
Act assented to by is Majeat>'."

Here is another clause»which. I thiuk ha.
some importance. It says that the courts,
are established not for the benefit cf judges
but for the- benefit. ci -suitors:
It la sald te be - much, more-,i1nportant to

and it Is only when thé people of Canada hé..

would be an advants.gé, and that thé con-ý
tinuance of thé appeal ta Eingland would be not
a bénéfit. but a grievance, that lta abolition in
lkely ta bé propcsed.
1It in salîd that thé "Act would deprivé sultors

And sc on. There is a whole table cf thé
number of appeals:

ln the majorlty of cases. and that their expectationa are reallzed.
The paper procéeds to observe that Canadians
are by no means the only parties ta duits in
Canadien courts: that every British subject
who hau ivested money or bought propérty
in Canada in eqÙally lnterested in the administration of Justice in thése provinces; tliat

no such danger la apprehended f rom the more

Thé papér cancludes by an observation that
as there te no disposition on thé part of thé

Carnarvon's suggestion that the limit of appealablé value may be raised. and suggests its

THE KITSILANO INDIAN RESERVE.
Ho.Mr. LOUGHEED-Betore the Orders
ofteDay are proceeded with may I correct a mistake which was made the other
day in the statement I made toî.he House
in -regard ta the order moved for by my
han. friend, the Han. Mr. Bosteck. I gave
the impression te the Hanse that the report et the Joint Commission on Indian
Reserves would be submitted ta Parliament. I find that I was mistaken in that
statement. I -naW read tram a certified
copy ot a report cf the Cornmittee of the
Privy Council, dated November 27, 1912, indicating what the arrangement was between
the two Governments. that ie the Government of British Columbia and the Dominion Government:

the most ample opportunity will be given to al
concerned for fully discussing it with a view to
arriving at a satisfactory determination of the
whole subject.

At *that time I was unaware of the arrangement between the two Governments
to which I have Teferred. 'I theretore desire ta correct the mistake.
.Hon. Mr. BOfiTOCK-I appreciate the
hon. gentlemans explanation, and would
like very much to impress on the 'Government that I do not think any arrangement between the Dominion and Provincial Governments should be. made at the
present time, when the Provincial Government is, I may say, a moribund Government. It has only about fiteen days more
lite. The Legisiature of British Columbia
will corne ta an end on the lst of June, and
I ask my hon. friend, even if this report
cannot be submitted te Parliament, ta
represent very strongly to his colleagues
that no actiop should be taken as between
the two -Governments at the present time,
but that the matter should be let t over untii
the people 'of British Columbia have had
an opportunity of deciding whether they
have the same confidenoe in the pressent
Government as tbey have had in the pant.
That is only a reasonablo request to make.
and I hope' my hon. friend will take it inta
eonsideration.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-All I can aay ta
my han. friepd is that that is peculiarly a
matter fer the British Columbia Gyovernment. They may not view the situation in
the same gloarny light my hon. friend dees.
Hon. Mr.,POWER-If the British Columbia Government look at the position in a
more sanguine spirit than that indicated
by the hon, leader of the Opposition, that
is an additional reason. why the Government
here should not act until the hope of the
British Columbia Governrnent is realized,
and 'they know that they are dealing with
people who have the confidence of the peopie o! .British Columbia.

The Minister of Justice therefore advises
that the approval of the agreement shouid be
subject ta a further provision which should be
accepted by the Government of British Calumbia before the agreement can be effective:

Gross earnings..........$293.985

FIRST AND SECOND READINGS.

A message was received fromn the House
of' Gommons wit Bill No. 101, An Act to
authorize the acquisition of Uines of railway between the city of Quebec end Nairn
Falls and between Lyster and St. Jean des
Chaullons.
The Bill was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of the Bill. He said: The object of
this Bill is to authorize thc Minister of
Railways bo acquire, under the provisions
of the Government Railways Act, upon such
conditions and ternis as the Governor in
Council may approve, the railways described in the schedule to the Bill. The
first railway set out in schedule 2, paragraph (a) is a Uine of railway commonly
known as the Quebec, Montmorency and
Charlevoix Railway,. extending froni St.
Paul street, in the city of Quebec. to St.
Joachim, a distance of about forty-three
and one-fifth. miles; <b> the Quebec end
Saguenay railway, extending froni its uetion with, the Quebec. Montmorency and
Charlevoix railway at St. Joachimi, in the
county of Montmorency, to Naixn Falls in
the county o! Charlevoix, a distance of
about sixty-two and eight-tenths miles;
and (c) the Lotbinière and Megantic railway. extending froni Lyster ini. the county
of Megantic to St. Jean des Chaullons in
the county of Lotbinière, a distance o! about
thirty miles.
Speaking of the first road, namely the
Quehec, Montmoicency and Charlevoix railway, I must say that this road is fully
equipped with rolling stock necessary to
handie business, with stations and other
buildings and everything, in fact, complete
to carry on business. It bas electrified
part of the line and passes through Ste.
Anne de Beaupré, east o! Quebec, alonv, the
north aide of the St. Lawrence river. Vfin
earnings of this line from 1910 are as foilows:

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Could my hon.
friend state whether thàt road pays the interest on the -bonds?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The net earnings
weuld be applied upon the bonds. I wil
come to that presently.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The net earnings are
what the road carne above the expenses.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes; beyond the
The difference beoperating expenses.
tween the net aud gross earnings is set

and which I submit, as f ar «s this section
o! the road ils coucerned, is o! a very satisfactory.- character. The next section o!
the road is known as the Quebec and
Saguenay. This line has not been completed, but acoording to the estimate o!
Government engineers, is about 87 per cent
completed. Itbhas been estimated that it
will take from $700,000 to $1,000,000 te coniplete the lime.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-How many miles?

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Sixty-two miles.
The company has issued bonds to the extent of $4,684,400, of which two and a hall
million sold at 84 cents on thc dollar, and
$2,184,000 sold at 82 cents, realizing on both
$3,M~,315.42, which amount, with additional
cash o! $ 1,050,000, bas been put inte the
road. There is due for right o! way dlaims
and other accounts $461,000, making a total
of $5,333,315.42, which the company dlaim
has been paid out on the road. They were
paid ;by the Government a subsidy account
of $132,000, and as I have already said, it is
cstimated it will take from $700,000 to
94 $1,000,000 to complete the line. Now, be0

o! this particular section, may I deal with
the other section of the liue, namely the
04 Lothinière and Megantic road. This line

Bill, from Lyster ini the county of Megantic,

Han. Mr. CLORÂN-That is, the net earnings per annum?
Han. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, for thasE
particular years. The. total coat ot the line
was $349,20W.85. It is praposed that the
Government shail take over this line, divided inta the three sections which I have
enumerat-ed. The payment ta be made
therefore shail ha thi value ta be fixed by
the Exchequer Court on the foflowing basis,
as will be observed fram clause 2 in the
Bill:
2. The consideration to b. paid for each of
the. said ra.ilways and for any equipment, appurtenances and propertles that may be acquired as aioresald shall b. the. value thereof
as determined by the Exchequer Court of Canada; maid value to be the~ actuai cMo f uaid
ra.ilways, lems ueidis and lesu depreclation.
but not te exceed four million, 'three hundred
aud forty-nine thousand dollars, exclusive of
outatanding bonded indebtedness which is te
b. assumed by the Goveriunent, but flot to exceed In ail twe million, live hundred thousand
dollars

Il will thereiore be observed that tlie Government has protected i.tseli in adopting
this basis ai valuation, so that even the
actual cost o! the road msy not be realized
so far as the. owners are concernied, on secounit o! the maximum value wh1ch has
been fixed in the Bill. In any event this
shall not exceed the $4,349,000, even though
the. cost ai the *road should very substantielly exceed that amount. Hon. gentlemen
who came fromn thé province of Quebec 'are
mare familiar than I arn with the possibilities o! this road.
Han. Mr. CLORAN-No.
Han.. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is needless tc
say that the. positian of the road, and the
conditiens attending lts construction, and
the demasnds or requirements of th. people
of Québec, make it desirable that something shauld be dane towards its acquisition ta prevent lhe portion which bas alS-351

ready been ibuit falling into disuse, and
the money which has been expended thereupon being absolutely wasted. The intention is that it should iorm a branch of, or
be uaed in connection wlth the Transcontinental systesn. The sections of Québec
thraugh which the road rune, 1 understand,
are fairly well settled, and are possessed
of possibilities which augur well for its
future, and demand fromî the Government
that reasonaïole railway facilities be provided for that particular section of Québec.
I amn fully aware of t.he fact that the Que,
bec and Saguenay section of this road has
been subjected te a great deal of public
criticium, much of which was exaggerated
and may possibly not have been ta the advantage of Canada. Suffice te say that this
road received the support of the late Govern-ment, inasmuch as a substantial subsidy was given ta the pramoters when they
entered upon its constiruction, and I apprehend that the Goyernment in granting that
subsidy did not fail ta perforrn their dutyand properly investigaxe the merits af the
undertaking.' lt, therefore, hadl the -sanction of the Federal Government at the Mime
the projeci WaS entered upon, and it is
not unreasonable te say, in view of the
tact that tihe Government of Canada has
taken over the Transcontinental system,
and this particular section of Quebec looke
torward ta the Government furnishing it
w!th neceseary railway facflities, that negotiations should be enteted into for the
Under
purpose of acquiring the road.
those circurnstancea I therefore submit the
Bill to the Hanse wit'h a rearzonable degree
o! confidence, feeling t'hat it ivili be supported, and asic ,or ite second reading.

on the 2Sth April last I referred, I think, to
my brother who had been dismissed from
the Immigration Department in Montreal
two days after my remarks in the Senate.
Now I have received a latter from the
Minister of the Interior in which he statee:
It may be that the. decisibn that was come
to was not received by C. Choquette until 20
or 21et .TanuaryTwo days after 1 epoke"But the Investigation and the decision bad

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I -should. say thiat
would relate to the lands which the Indians held on that particular day, and then
we niake that good; that is to say. the
lands were unsold on the let day of June,
1915, but they have afterwards been disposed of. 1 think that is the meaning of
that clause. Probably they were ail in the
Indian Patentee at that time.

Hon. Mr. BOBTOCK-I think I oug-ht to
draw the attention of the leader of the
Government to a rather irregular procedure
that bas occurred ini regard to this Bill.
When the motion was carriod to istrike out
this part of clause 2, which I understand
the leader is now moving to have reinstated, the hon, leader of the Government
then moved that the oommittee rise, but
our- chairman at that time neyer put the.
motion to the committee, nover gave the
mnembers of the committee an opportunity
of aaying whether they accopted the. motion or not. Ho uimply rose and left the
Chair. 1 thmnk, -without wishing to say
anything unkind o! our chairman, another
timo be should see that the motion is put
to the committeo, and give thomn an opportunity of Tecording their vote, whether they
wished the. motion carried or not.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY-I looked to the
leader of the Opposition for inspiration, and
ho gave me no sign. The House acquiesced
and I left the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÂND-There is no
question that the motion of my hion. friend
that the. committee riso was not put to the

Hon. Mr. MURPHY-I quite admît that

Hon. Mr. WÂTSON-I understand from

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Ye8, but ju'st as

Hon. Mr. WATSON.

Hon. Mr. *LOUGHEED-The Registrar
General caused the caveat to ho filed. Apparently whatever was done was done by
the Regîstrar General o! Manitoba, and
then o! course that at once suspended any
transaction with reference to the land.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-W;hy should the
Registrar General o! Manitoba have registered a caveat againet it?
the
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Because
Registrar General ls chargod with satisfying himsel! undor the Act that a proper
title has been made by the transferror o! the

been made, or liat a titie bas been made

there is no reason for -my amendmetnt, and

The SPEAKER-Not f rom that point of

in the proper way I should have a word te

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I may in-form
bis hon. the Speaker tha~t we took for
granted that the question of reorganizatin
of the reporting staff was, at aîl events by
tacit consent, left to the wisdom of the
Debates Committee. It needed considerable adjusting, and conferences had to be
held with the House of Gommnons upon it.
I felt et one time that the regular procedure should have been otherwise, but
at the last moment--as we alwayà act in a
hurried mniner-when aIl the conditions
appeared to be satisfactory, the Debates
Committee yesterday agreed upon this procedure, and I hope that his lion. the
Speaker will put up with the conclusions
we -have arrived at and sanction them by

The SPEAKER-I suppose I shahl have
to accept what the committee has done

RECONSTRUCTION 0F PARLIAMENT
BUILDINGS.
Hon. '-%r. WATSON-As hon. gentlemen
are aware, the leader oi the House and myself are on the committee for the reconstrucSome
tion Qf the Parliament Buildings.
changes in the plans- up to date have been
recommended and are on view in Hon. Mr.
Rogers' room, and the architect is there to
explain them. It has been suggested to put
another story on the top of the building,
and the plans showing the proposed addition are there to be seen.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE-The only intimation I have notioed from time to time as to
what changes are suggested is what appears
in the papers. There are two plans before
us, the first one that was submitted and
the subsequent one. I looked over both,
and it seemed te me that the majority of
those who were present were decidedly in
favour of the second one, but one of the City
papers mentioned that the firat plan had
been adopted. I could not understand why
that could be if the sentiment of those
present indicated their wish in the matter.
The firet one was practically somewhat like
the old one-s-howing the Senate as a Chamber within a Chamber, which did not extend te the outer walls; the other put the
Senate Chamber in tihe east end of the block,
vhe windows opening- to -the ouîteide, as in
this building. It would be interesting to
know which plan is to be adopted; the committee have not told us whieh one is preferred.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-It would be well to
see the plans before expressing an opinion
on it. As far as the Senate is concernied, a
good many members have approved of what
is known as Ewart's plan.
Hon. Mir. SPROULE-That is the plan I
referred to as the last one.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The commoners were
unanimous in favour of the other. A change
has recently been made, and at the last
meeting we thought it advi&abýe to have the
plans brought down so that hon. gentlemen
could see them*before they are adopted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Could the hon.
gentleman tell us what reasons were given
in favour of settling the plan which puts the
two Chambers at the extreme ends »of the
building and not in the center, as Mr. Ewart
suggested?

Hon. Mr. OWENS-No, that le the. Pearson plan.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I -have a good deal
of hesitation in riging ta prolong this sitting, but it just happens that I may not
b. able ta say a word hereafter in respect
ta these plans, and I thought it deeira-ble
ta say just a few word. now. In the first
place, it la desirable tbat no more money
etbould be spent thban is necessary ta make
the changes which are really desirable.
Speaking for the Sen«tée-I do flot undertake to speak for the Commons at ailthere is no necessity for any structural
.change in the building. I agree with the
chairman of the. committee, that putting on

an additional. etory je -an unobjectionable

posed ;by Messrs. Pearson and Marchand
would make a complets change in almost
every portion of the building, and to my
mind it wou.ld. be a more economioal and
more .atiefactory thing perhape to erect a
new -building. I have heard the cost of
the Pearson-March-and scheme put down
variously et £rom four millions of dollars
ta six millions, and this addition would
bring it up to five or seven millions. Now,
the changes that are neceasary in the
Senate end would involve almos't no additional expenditure, or a very aial one.
With respect to Mr. Ewart's plan, I wish
to put this point before. the Senate. The
number of senators now is about 87. lb is
not likely that within any reasonable time
the number of senators will b. increased
beyond 96. Now, the -Ohamber which, we.
have had since Con! ederation was more
than sufficient accommodation* for the 87
members. It 18 as large as the old House
of Commons, which. was intended Woaccommodate tome 200 members. -Mr. Ewart's
plan, as I rememiber il, provided that in
the reconstructed building, the Senate
Chamber would, b. nearly twice as large as
it was in the old building. Hon. gentlemen will tee that there is absolutely no
necessity for any such change. as that.
Not on-ly is there no necesdity for the
change, but the change would b. most mischievous. Hon. gentlemen who bave been
iii the habit of speaking in the old Chamber know that if we made it an-y larger it
would not -be satisfactory Wospeak in.. The
acoustic properties were net very good, and
therefore I think it would be a most serious mistake to make the Chambgr s0 large
that members engaged in discussing questions would be obliged Woshout. You cannot discuss and shout, hon. gentlemen; and
I think any proposai, to make the Senate
Chamber in the reconstructed building
larger than the original Senate Chamber
would b. a great mistake.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The reconstruction
would make it the same size as the old
one.
Hon. Mr. POWER-If anything, it ought
ta be a little amaller. However, I arn not
going to press that.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The Gommons Chamber is larger.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. POWER-The Senate end of the
building, asQ an architectural production.
was a very superior orie. It would be a pity
to alter the exterior o! the old Senate building. There is no necessity for doing it.
The tmking away of the housekeeper's rooms,
adding anothe r story, and tie clearing out
of the basement o! the, tiree towers will
give all tie accommodation that la likely
to be needed by the Senate for the next
hall Icentury. and I trust that the hon.
members o! the committee will bear that in
nmnd.
Hon. Mfr. DANIE,-I think I have seen
only one set o! plans. I did not know there
were two. I saw the met cf plans that was
brought over here and placed on the Table
cf our conunittee room; whoee they were
1 do not know. The only point 10 which
1 was going 10 refer was this, that I hope
whoever ham charge of replacing the old
building will bear in mind the lact, that
in mc far as ils corridors and tiings o! that
kind are concerned. the building was one
cf the wormt fir..trmps that existed in the
whole Dominion of Canada.
I hope the new plans will improve the
interior o! the building in that -respect, and
provide plenty o! exits in came of fire, and
a chance to reaci tie exits. As a malter
of lact, the main entrance was practically
the only exit !rom -the old building apart
froru the two sinaller onea in front. There
were smre doors, but nobody knew anytlxing about theru, and when lhe fire cecurred people were out off. Had a large
number been present. the lome of life would
have been very heavy indeed. Thst is one
point I wanl te refer to. The ventilation,
should be properly attended te. The recru
and corridors, and empecially the chambers
cf boti Houss, should be properly ventiIated, so that members will find the air
fresh and pure. Everybody who bas been

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-We have brot yet

Hon. Mr. CLORAK-I arn talking now of

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The Order Paper
is very srnall, butit is aIl right.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-As I said on a previeus occasion, the House of Commons railroads legialatien, and we put it through by

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-We are getting

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I ask the hon. chairman te, rule if this hon. House can conduct
business in such an illegal way. Motions

The SPEAKER: What motion doca the

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The hou. Speaker

The SPEAKER-If I do not know, and
the hon. member does not know, I do not
see how hon. members should know.
Hon. '.%r. CLORAN-Then it is for me to
point out to the Speaker hia ignorance of
the matter. At the last aitting, a day ago,
a motion was made and a notice of înquiry
ivas given. It is nlot on the Order Paper.
Now the Speaker should know that. I am
telling him.

received by the Clerk o! the House. You

The SPEAKER-Could the hon, gentleman have a copy of his notice of motion?
Hon. Mr. CLORÂN-I laid a copy of the

The SPEAKER-And did the motion recite on whatday it would be proposed?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The next sitting, because we have no other day to ait.
The SPEAKER-I beg the hon. gentleman's pardon.
Hon. Mr. CL'ORAN-AIl I want to know is
this, if I can now ask the hon. the leader of
the Government whether he ia prepared to
answer my inquiry in regard -to the Extension Bill, and secondly, if he is prepared te
bring down the papers and documents regarding the Extension Bill passed between
the Iniperial Government and the Government of Canada. These are matters of
public importance.
Hlon. Mr. LOUGHEED-My hon. friend
would have te do that by way of address.
I can tell my hon. frîend that the legisla*

The SPEAKER-Orders of the Day.
QUEBEC AND SAGUENAY RAILWAY
BILL.
On the Order of the Day being called.
Reauming the adjourned debate on the m(ton
for the second readlng of Bill loi. an Act to

authorize the acquisition of lines of railway
between the city of Quebea and Nairn Falla
and between Lyster and St Jean dés Cha ilions.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-This Bill has been
brought down ta us in the last hours of
the session, and the leader of the Goverument this aiternoon did not give us a very
full statement of the object.of the Bill or
the railways to which it refera. Coming as
I do from a part of the country distant
from that in which these railways are
located, I feel that I have not had aUl the
time I could desire to examine into this
matter and study the whole situation. The
papers that have been braught down to the
House contain very long reports made by the
Minister of Railways and Canais on these
three different railways and the value of
them, and contain a great dcial of information exceedingly valuable ta this House,
but in the short time that we have had to
look at those papers it bas been almost impossible to get a lthoroughly detaîled statement that I could present to the House in
speakîng upon this matter. The railways
we are asked to deal with are apparently
three separate pieces of railway. One is
known as the Quiebec, Montmorency ana
Charlevoix railway, with a length of fortythree and one-fifth miles. That I understand is on the north shore of the St. Lawrence river, and conneets up with the Quebec and Saguenay. The Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix railway, as I understand it, is a line in operation, and is

proposai is that this railway and the
Quebec and Saguenay railway shall be

-the. Lotbinière and Megantic railwaywhich la ion the other aide of the river,
I cannot see ,very, clearly why that
rodshould be joined with the other

Railways waas asked to 'take over one ci
these roads and Tnake it a part cf the Intercoloni'al railwey, but he did not feel him,self juistified at thet tinie in doing se..
He considerad it was not in the interest
cf the country that the Intercolonial railway should ha buying up railroads here
and there simply because nmen who had
put their money into theni and had floated
the bonds on these roads found they were
not as prosperous as they *had axpectadl,
and they were flot getting the return for
their xnoney thet they had hoped for.
Therefore. if we woe flot justified. in the

have so much heavier 'burdens to place
upon the people cf this country. Owing to
the war the Minister cf Finance bas had
ta place on the people of this country
direct taxation for the purpose of helping
ta defray the cest of this war. He bas had
te cause the people of this ceuntry ta psy
an extra cent. on every latter they post snd
twe cents on eviery cheque they draw, and

years before they can be put in any position ta produce a revenue to pay the intareet on the money that 'bas been spent
upon them. The other day there was a
long discussion in another place on the
question of the Government taking over ail
the railways of the country and assuming
the nationalization of the railways. If th-E
Government is bo be called upon to take
ovar those railways and pay for thesu a
great deal more than any business man
would pay for them, 1 consider that it
would ba one of the very strongest arguments against any proposai for the nationalization of the reailways of this country. The people will consider that the
Government at the present time should do
evierything they can te conserve the resources of the country and prevant waste of
money, but while the membars of the Goverament bave been telling the people from
one end of the country to the other that
they must economize and save money in

deal of time to consider this Bill.
When they corne to look into it I think
they will feel that Îhe,! are flot justified
in placing on the country to-day a burden
such as this Bill calls upon them to carry.
The burdens of the country are increasing
enormously in a financia] way, and at the
same time, I regret to ssy, cur population
is not increasîng nearly as fast as it did
years ago. With a population that is increasing- slovly, we will have ta meet a
burden for interest on indebtedness such as
this country has neyer had to face before.
and the people will find. thernselves
burdened with taxation which will take
them a very long lime ta overcorne. The
Minister cf Inland Revenue found it necessary the other day ta place a tax on ail
business enterprises in this country. Hie
took 25 per cent cf the profits cf companies
after they had paid 10 per cent dividends.
for the purpose cf supplying the meney
necessary ta help prosecute the war, and
yet we find the Government is asking us
now ta pass a Bill which -will cause theni
to incur an expenditure that will eat up
at lest one-third, if not more, cf the proceeds of that tax. These are the reasans
why I consider that this House would net
be justified in passing this Bill. I therefore inove, seconded by Hon. Mr. Watson,

the engineeer report which fixed the
amnount at $3,202,000, to the extent of some
$1,100,000.
In the face of such a discrepancy in the figures given by the company and the figures that are given us by
the chief engineer of the Intercolonial railway (if!1 ar n ot mistaken that ia has titie),
who made this report and.o! the tact 'which
is most exceptional, that in October last,
I think, the company made an offer to the
Goviernment declaring that uts total cost
in the purchase of those three roads and
the amount it would ask was 5600,000 odd
less than the amount it now asks, we should
proceed cautiously.
The president, it le
true, sys that it was through a miscqI.
culation, or misinterpretation o! his demand upon his accountant that this error
happened. But when we -have this large
discrepancy between the figures of the
company and those of the chie! engineer,
and when, hesides, we have the fact, that
this 62 and 8 10 miles which are only conatructed to the extent of 87 per cent, cost
at this moment, if w, taire the figures cl
the company, about 880,000 a mile, it
seemas to me that we wbhould b. somewhat
prudent in the mandate that we should
give the Judge of -the Exehequer 'Court.
Now, that judge will have to acoept as a
basic for bis examination o! the value of
ihis road, the following direction:

by the company o! the money u-pon those
roads to make hie addition and find out
what actually 'has been paid, or what
actually those three roads have cost the
company to date. Now, the expenditure
o! $80,090 a mile upon an uncompleted road,
without any stations, without any rails, so
to speak, seems to be such a large amount
that the judge, -in my opinion, should be

more
than $15,000 a

is the actual, reasonable and necessary

can with a clear conscience establieh a
bona fide expenditure of the amount which
they dlaim to have spent, they would not
refuse to enlarge to a certain extent the

Court, as to whose integrity and abihity
everybody is satisfied.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Subject to counterproof.
Hon. Mr. BEÂUBIEN-I understand the
judge wiil only accept conclusive proof.
Therefore, if there ie any dÔubt in his mind
hie will, s in duty bound, make that quite
clear. They will have to go to court and
put in ail particulars of th£ actual value of
those roads, and when they do that, if the
value should exceed the sum of $4,349,000"
they lose any balance in excess thereof.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Is that on the three
roads or on the one?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN-That ie on the
three roads.
They will corne down and
prove No. 1, Quebec and Montmorency,
they will prove No. 2, Quebec and Saguenay, and they wiil prove No. 3, Lotbinière
and Megantic, making a grand total of oc
much. The Government will firet of ail
assume bonds for $2,500,000; that will be the
firet peyment, and then wifl in addition
give cash not exceedimg the figure 1 have
mentioned. Let us ee if we can briefly
find ont how much those roads are worth,
roughly speaking. A greet many people in
this House no doubt know the cost of railroad construction. This ie a difficuit road
to build. It has been cut, precticafly,
through a solid cliff of rock. Everybody
knows the north shore of the river St. Lawrence. The total cost to the country, by
the assuniption of those bonds, and by the
payment of the sum 1 have mentioned will
The
aggregate a grand total of $6,965,000.
Government cen pay that, but it cannot
pay more then that sum. Whet eseets wil
the Governiont acquire by the paymient
of that sum? There je one esset which is
eesily appreised. It je 135,000 square feet
oi land situeted in the best portion of the
city of Quebec, a part of wbich I understand has been paid for by the Government et $12 a foot. There is no getti.ng out
of thet. How imuch je that' $1,620,000.
Now there are buildings upon this plot of
ground which I have been inforxned are
worth $180,000. This emount added to the
$1,620,000 makes a total of $1,800,000 which
everybody cen escertein. Deduct 81,800,000
f roin the amount of $6,965.000. beîng the
maximum ýhe Government will have to pay.
What belance je leftP It ie a little over
$5,000,000 or exactly $5,165,000. That will
be the cost to the Governmcnt of these
t.bree moade, lees the cost of the Quebec terminal. But the Gavernment will have to

finish the roed. 1 understand there are two
opinions as to the amount of money required to complete them. One enginear
estimetes the amount required for this purpoee at $700,000. and the other et 81,000,000.
Let us strike a medium between the
two and ,make it 8W5,000. That would
give a grand total of $6,015,000 for the
whole of the railroad. completely flniehed
and reedy to operate. These roads comprise
136 miles, w~hich means a little over $44,000
per mile'. Anybody who hec gone down the
river St. Lawrence and knows the uiorth
shore will readily admit that this je not in
the leaet an exeggerated price.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Cost more on the
prairies.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN-fljat is going to
be the revenue fronii these ronds, roughly
speeking? The two roads that are now paying a revenue, tha Quebec and Montmorency and the Lothinière and Meg-antic bring
in $83,000. The Government ie now spending, because there ie no railway on the
north shore, $80,000 that can. be saved. It
is paying for the transportation of mail to
other railways about $5,400; for the operation of the Intercoloniel ràilway, Rivière
Quelle branch, $22,000, and $52,000 for the
ferry from Rivière Quelle to Murray Bay,
or in round figures $80,000. Add thie eaving
of $80,000 to the $83,000 produced by the
Quebec and Montmorency and the Lotbinière and Megantic and you obtain e total of
$163,000. Now, hon. gentlemen, is it not
fair to think thet the Quebec and Saguenay
will earn soniething' On the sainue ratio of
eerning per mile as the Quebec and Montmorency, the Quebec and Saguenav ought
te earn $120,000. Therefore in sevings, in
actuel end inost probable earnings, we have
in sight practically 5 per cent on the amnount
invested. Under these circumstances I will
certainly vote for the Bill.

took for granted that the words, 'said value

mesant what would be interpreted as represented by the actual expenditure made
by the company.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-May I interrupt
my hon. friend again. Would not the Bill
then have said, "the said value to be the
cost"-what it cost?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-But it is not what
it cost, but the actual cost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Then I suppose
my hon. friend takes the word "coet" as
a synonym for value?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes.
Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND-The actual
value« cf said railway?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No, I do not
think the actual value; what it actually
cost, or what it should coat, and what it
can be done for under ululear conditions.
Hon. M. DÂNDURÂND-It struck me
that if w. added to the word "actuel" the
words -reesonable and necessary" then we
give the judge the mandate of finding if
that actuel expenditure was reasonable and

of the pre4ent Governinent a.nd Partiarnent?
2. Bas the Goverfiment of Canada transmitted the said Bill to the proper British
authorities for sanction by the British Parhiament?
S. When, and on w.hat date did the Government of Canada transmit to the British authorities the Raid -Bill of Extension unanimously adopted by both Eunes of the Canadian
Parliament?
4. Why bas flot the sanction of the British
PaLrhiamolt been Civen- to the said Bill of
Extension requesting the amendmunt tO the
British North America Act so aB te give the

sentence of one year?*

He said: Parliament is about to expire
in a few hours. Though it would be a cruel
thing 10 have a death bed confession in
this matter, if the hon. gentleman has the
answer I shall accept it.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-ÂII I can say io
my hon. friend is that the Government did
duly transmit the Bill to the proper British authorities for consideration by the
British Parliament, and that it i8 now before the Imperial Parliatnent. What the
lamperial Parliament will'do with it is for
them t6i say. This Government and this
Parliament cannot do anything more than
they have already done.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The only point 1
want to have answered directly is on what
date was it transmitted. The hon. gentleman says it was duly transitted. I want
to know the date.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I can not tell
my hon. friend. I amn unaware of that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-But are not

Hon. Mr. SPROULE-I have had éornetbing to do with the difficulties attending
the filling of these appointmente. I found
there wae a conflict of opinion between the
Librarians of Parliament and the Civil
Service Comnmiseion as to where the authority for such appointiments lay. At my Tequet it wae submitted to the Justice Department, and speaking from niemory, the
Justice Department stsstained the contention of the Commission,. that the autherity
lay with the commniseion, that where appointmente vere made during the recese
between the sessions of Parliament they
muet be made by Order in Council. I do
,Pnot thînk the Justice Departrnent deait
with this feature of it, that it was proper
when Parliamnet reassexnbled to submit

was the information conveyed to me, and
upon which I endeavoured to act for the

CANADA SHIPPING ACT AMENDMENT
BILL.
FIRST, SECOND AND

THIRD REA.DINGS.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED uioved the second
reading cf the Bill. He said: This is a Bill
that was introduced in the Heuse cf Coinmious by Mr. Sinclair, the :member for
Guysborough. It is a Bill to which hé has
been peciiliarly wedded, and being possessed cf merite, the Government consîdered
it necessary, for the purpose cf paeeing it
cruring the present session, te assume the
responsibility for ite conduct through Parliament, and accordingly did se.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Hear, hear. Good
thin..
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The Shipping
Act at present is regarded, particularly by
the maritime trade cf the Maritime Provinces, as being entirely toc restrictive with
reference to the certificates which are issued
frorn time to time to coasting captains.
The present law limite the coasting captain
te five degrees north latitude. That is te
say, he is net per.mitted te clean hie veseel
for any point funther south than tive degrees north. *The distance that a ship je
allowed to go is governed entirely by the
certificate the captain holds. It je needlesu te say that theré are t.wo classes cf centificates, one which might be termed the
deep sea, certificate, which permits a captain te clear for any port ih the world, and
the othen a ceasting certificate. It je
thought very desirable, therefore, to enlarge
the powers cf a coasting captain te exercice a very much widen latitude than that
alreàdy gîven him unden the Canada Shipping Act. I undenstand that a change was
made before Confederation, or possibly
after Confederation-I cannot at the moment direct attention te the particular
peint cf tirne at which it occurnedand that restriction was adopted. It is
very désirable that this be enlarged in
accordance with the Bill which je before
us. It je théreforé proposed, jnstéad of
restricting a coasting captain to clearing
for a port net further south than five degrees north latitude, that he should have a
right te clear for a port net further south
than 443degrees south latitude, and this, it
is providéd:
ease a voyage between any port or
-alie
place on the western ceast ot Canada, and

any other port or place on such coast, or on
the western coat ot the Terrltery of Alaska,
or of the United States of Amnerica or of the
western coast ef Mexico or Central Amérlea
or South Mnerlca not further south than forty

degrees south latitude."
A message was Teceived from the House

ditional power te coasting captains.
The Bill was read the firet time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

_MAY 18, 1916

Hon. Mr. BOCHE-I wauhd briefly sa>thiat the advantage of this Bill in the province of New Brunswick, and the other
Maritime Provinces, would be ta enable
vessels to proceed te Brazil. Under present
regulations they would not be able te. go
further than the West Indies, and thia
change would enable vessels with piece
cargoes and other cargoes te go to Brazil.
It is very desirable te extend trade in that
direction, and therefore it would be a great
advantage teoaur captains. They have
vessels that may be engaged in the flshing
business in sunîmer, and carrying lumber,
but in the winter the>- wish to be free to
voyage te Brazil for lumber and other producta; therefore it would be a great advantage to have this latitude.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton) -Under the
preàent haw -the coasting captain could go
ta the north pole. There is ne restriction
on going north, snd it was thought an
illogical thing to restrict hira from going
south. 0f course there was some underlying influence that we do not know anythini
about which, gave rise te that restriction.
They were first allowed te go to a certain
distance south, then the limit was extended
te five degrees north, snd now they want te
go down te Brazil te trade. They cannot
go beyond the Horn.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Hlow

cannot go round the Hotu. I do not see
why they sbouhd not be allowed to go
round the Hotn, because as a matter of
fact the navigation that they are sllowed at
the present time is -more difficult than the
navigation froni which they are excldded.
I should be very glad to see it cut out.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I have nlot had
vory long te study this Bill, but the ver>point raised by the hon. seustor from
Middleton occurred ta me in this connectien. It seenis ta me that. if a captain je
qualified te go as fat south as he ahlowed te
go now, either on the east or the weet
coast of America, hie ought to be sufficient>capable ta malte the whole voyage round.
Another point, which it seems te me lias nat
been considered, is a question affecting the
this canal is open
Panama canal. .If
and in operation, Canadian vessele, I presume, wilh he using it, and I do net see

wrn) a captain, if he is capable of goinge
downi the coast as far as the canal, should
net be allowed to go through the canal and
corne along the other coast. I do not know
whether this question was given any consideration when the Bill was before -the
House, but it certainly seems that it
should be considered and the Bill should
be amended in that way in the shipping
inte<eet. 0f course this has corne up at
such a late hour of the session that we
have not had the time to give it the consideration that a Bill of this nature deserves, and possibly it might not be a good
thing to be amending lt now, but it cortainly should be considered.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middleton)-There is
another point in, connecition with it; the
Panama canal is hiable ta be closed every
now and then. A eaptain might be going
froni British Columbia under a coasting
license and suddenly find t.he canal closed,
and that ship would have to lie there until
she got a new captain.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I believe the Bill
very properly excludes captains froni going
&round Cape Horn. There is ne navigation
ln the known world more difficult. Only
large pewerful eships with deep-sea captains can undertake it, and should undertake it. If that privilege 'were given to
coasting captaîns, then I say there would
be practically no difference between their
oertificate sud that cf deep-sed captains.
In their own iuterest that privilege should
net be given to them, because a fool-hardy'
captain might attempt it, sud be soiriy for
it in the other world.
Hou. Mr. MeýILENNAN-On the whiole I
believe that the« coasting captains and navigators of the lower provinces are worthy
of the extension of this priviiege te them.
I have had a good deal of erperience wi.th
them and can say that they are rexnarkVith regard to
ably ekilful navigators.
fool-hardines. which might of course take
place, theire are the interests af the ineutance companies and of t.he owuers to avoid
voyages which ought net to be undertaken;
but the men are akilful as a whole on their
own cost, extraordinarily skilful, and can
do thinge that navigators much more tecliuicalhy trained could not do, and thoe
qualîties ujake it perfec±ly saie te grant
this extension te then to go larther south

Hon. M.r. DANIEL,-I remaxnber this matter being before Parliament in the other
Chamber for a number.of yeams. When .1
was a member of the -Marine Committee
the subject was broaohed and talked over,
but it reaUy came to a head and received
'the approval of the Govemnment ta such
t.he Governan extent as ta have
ment back them as they are doing at thie
present time. I think the extension cf the
authority given by the coamting certificate
down as f ar as Brazil will be sufficient. It
will b. extensive enough. It appears to me
tha>t ta aliow 'a coasting man kc take a

make, however, on behaTf o! the Government for approaching the Senate on this

The strain and etress o! national affair6

war, a war which hie convulsed not only
the whole o! Europe, but the whole world,
and which has practically closed the door
o! the money markets o! the world, particularly bo those enterprises upon which Catiadian capitalists had entered. The Goverument o! Canada, not only the present
Government but previous -Governments, for
a period o! years have been inclined to
view very favourably railway undertakings
having for their objeot the opening up of
our vast country and the providing o! new

SENATE

transportation systenis to meet public requiremenits. They have given evidence af
this by the adoption of a palicy which.has
long remained an aur statute-books af
granting substantial aid from time ta time
to all railway enterprises which niay have
corne within the terme of the Act. The
comiiiittals af the Government ai Caiiada
since Confederation for the purpose ai
building up the transportation systems ai
this country have been sa overwhelmingly
large that ta survey them inclines one ta
say that the dauntless character af Canadian Governments bas flot been eclipsed
by any other government in the world. We
have assumed obligations for the building
af aur railways that I fancy have no parallel in any other canstitutionally governed
country. Hlowever, that bas been the policy
ai Canada for some years past, and we
find aurselves under presenlt conditions,
awing ta the march af events which has
convulsed the world within the last twa
years, called upon ta take stock ai aur
obligations and ta conuider where they will
lead us. This situation is peculiarly applicable ta Canada at the present time in connectian with the twa' great undertakings
which are now before us for consideratian.
It is needless ta discuss at this moment
why Canada entered upon the building af
thase transcontinental systems. Suffice it
ta say that, in the wisdorn of the Government ai the day, we are cammitted ta those
undertakings and ta the maintenance of
the credit and the honour ai Canada in a
financial sense, and ta the bringing ai those
enterprises ta a satisfactory completian if
we can possibly do so. Now, in the first
place we propose, as 1 have already pointed
out, -making a boan ta the Canadian Northern Railway ai $15,000,000 an first mortgage security on a 6 per cent basis, that
éecurity ta caver the entire system. Notvrithstanding the enormous obligations
whieh have been assumed, not anly by this
Governnient, but by the Provincial Governments ai Canada, in connectian with
this enterprise, there are some satisiactory
features ai the undertakîng which should
not be overlaoked. In the first place, the
Government ai Canada is interested in the
enterprise ta the extent af protecting its
gua-rantees. It has an interest ini the undertakinu ta the extent ai 40 per cent ai its
stock, and an interest, as 1 have already
said, in, maintaining the credit ai Canada
by protectîng the guarantees which we have
already entered into, and also indirectly
pratecting the guarantees oi the various
provinces ai Canada that likewise have

cent convertible debenture -stock of 325,000,000, making a funded debt of $383,70,798. ln this connection it may flot be inappropriate for me to point out the advantages the Canadian Northern raiiway
bas over other railways as to its fixed
charg-es, and as ta the poss'ibility ci its
competing in the future as a railway enterprise with the otber transcontinental
systeins, possibly involvmng action in the
ineantime by the Govemment in regard ta
further protection of aur guaranteei upon
whieh we -have entered. At the same time
I should like ta point out to hon, gentlemen that the position in relation ta fixed
,charges of the Canadian Northern railway,
notwithstanding the very large deot,
funded and otherwise, which I have pointed
out, is. dn a senae, superior ta that af the
other 'roads. I find that the Grand Trunk
Pacifie railway has a fixed charge ai 54,132
per mile, on a mileage of 1,744 miles. The
Grand Trunk raîlway ai Canada. with a
inileage of 3,552 miles, bas a fixed charge
per mileai $2,745. The Canadian Pacifie
railway, with a mileage of 12,824 miles,. lias
a fixed charge per mile ai $2,402, while the
Canadian Northern railway, with a mileage
of 9,993 miles, bas a fixed charge ai $1,299.
Now let me repeat that, s0 that hon. gentlemen -niay appreciate the adviantages ai
this particular system, notwithstanding
the financial disadvantages against which
it has at present ta contend.

Northern railway any land reserve?

te more than the interegt on the bonds as
stated iii the return brought down by the
Goverrnent. But we have te -bear in mind
that at the prissent time we have to provide
the sum o! $3,046,616 for two years of intereat on bonds that we have guaranteedI think that is on the bonds o! the 145,000,000 guarantee and the -$35,000,000 guarantee-there!ore at the present time the cernpany is xiot liable bo pay the interest on
those bonds. Further, the province of British Columbia bas te provide the sum cf
$1,467,8W0 on bonds guaranteed by that
province for three years after the lines are
in operation; therefore that Teduces bo that
extent the actual arnount that is put down
as due by the railway, rnaking $4,514M0
altogether. From the staternent made bo
the House by the lion. leader cf the Geverunent I was net quite clear whether it
was going bo be necessary for this Government bo corne bo the assistance cf the province of British Columbia and advanoe
thern the money bo carry out that guarantee. 'We ail know that as f ar as the province o! British Columbia is concerned, the
finances cf that province, 1 arn very sorry
bo have te eay, are in a very unsatisfactory
condition bo-day; and if they have bo turn
around aud find this amount of meney in
order bo pay the interest on those guaranteed bonds I think it is going te place that
province in a very awkward position at the
present time; but it may possibly be that
the Federal Government intends bo corne
to the assistance of the province in that
way. Therefore we are in this position:
that the country, through the Government,
will have te find, in addition bo this loan
o! $ 15,000,000, the sum of $6,540,507 interest
on guaranteed bonds, and there is etill
an amount of $1,300,000 credit balance in
the trust account of the Canadian Northeru
Ontario, and a further credit balance from
the securities guaranteed by the Dominion
two years age, that is in 1914, of $4,300,000,
making a total of money still in the trust
account o! $5,600,000. Se that altogether
the Canadien Northern bo-day is ebtaining
heom the Governnient and from the country a sum over $25,000,000 for the purpese
of paying interest on bond guarantees, and
aise for the purpose of liquidating pressing
liabilities. The hon. gentleman, in discussing this question of the Canadian Northern, did net say anything as to how the
-Gevernment was geing b see that this
xnoney was carefully expended. I think it
is meet important in the intereste of the
country that the Government should keep

very strict and careful centrol o! the expenditure of every cent of this money; that
they should know exactly where it je expended and what Ait l expended on; and
further, that they should see that no f urther development ie carried on by this railway company or any of its subsidiary comnpanies until we know exactly what position
For instance, in

and I thin4c the Governent should see
that no more developrnent work is done
st the presen't tirne until we know exactly
where this company stands and *how this
money is being spent. The hon. gentleman
gave us the figures with regard to the position of the Canadian Northern Railway and
the Grand Trunk Pacifie as to their earning power, and the amount that this represented per mile of the railway. Put in that
way, I think it places the Canadian Northern Railway in a very much more faveurable position than when we examine it
from another point of view. The figures
were given the other day in another place,
when it was statéd in regard to the Canadian Northern Railway, that the railroad
systern is carried in their balance sheet at
over $430,000,000, and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, with ail its equipment and ail its
additions, is shown only at'the figure o!
$503,000,000--a difference of $73,000,000 as
between the two lines. I think the hon.
gentleman stated that the mileage of the
Canadian Pacifie railway was 12,000 and
o! the Canadian Northern rail-way sorne
9,000 miles, so that the difference of those
3,000 miles weuld be represented by the
$73,000,000, on that figuring. Then when
we corne to look we find -a very large surplus revenue o! the Canadian Pacifie Railway which is available for paying the fixed
charges -on that road whichi last year were
only $ 10,000,006, whîle the charges o! the
Canadian Northern were $ 15,000,000 per
annum. That gives us sorne idea of the
burden that the Canadian Nerthern Railway has to carry as compared with the
other road. Then we have also to bear in
mind that the Canadien Northern Railway
ic not in the came position as the Canadian
Pacifie Railwny as far as its equiprnent and
such matters are concerned. So that the
position is net as favourable as one would
like to cýee it in regard te the Canadian
Northern Railway, and a matter that the
Government has te take very carefully inte
censideration is as to hew this snoney is

hon. leader of the Government 'we find that
for the Estimates this year we are passing
a total of $271,000.000, and from the statemonits made by thle Minister of Finance we

This is a very serious burden for the country

road and its equipment may be brought
up to a hig-her point than it occupies et
the present time. With regard to the statement the hon. gentleman made as to the
Grand Trunk Pacifie, we find on examining
that statement that the total amount necessary to pay interest and some other items
is $9,376,844, but of that amount the Dominion Government has in any case te pay the
sum of $1,655,121, leaving us to provide in
this particular instance the suum of $7,721,-_
723 to meet the interest on the bonds guaranteed both by the Dominion Government
and by the Grand Trunk Pacific itself. So
thet according to this statement the country
is providing about $200,000 more than the
amount neoessary te pay the interest on
those guaranteed bonds, including 01
course the bonds guaranteed by the province of Alberta and the province of S askat-chewan. In this case we are net taking
hold in any way of the liabilities of the com-

This attack on the Senate

is entiîely un-

called for. Speaking foi myseh!, I knew
nothing of the discussion that had taken
place in the Railway Comrnittee on the
clause in the two Private Bis îeferîed ta,
which extended the tirne for the cornpletion or building of hunes ini the Niagara
Peninsula. When it carne ta the Senate it
was sent ta the Railway Comrnittee. There
we found that coupled with it was an Act
arnding the Railway Act. It was rnentioned that iL had for its abject the gîving of poweîs ta the Board of Railway
Commissioners in dealingc with the location
of these hunes. The Senate found that this
arndmerit to the Railway Act was goiug
in, restaring not only the powers which
weîe given the Railway Board in 1903, as
the article states, but rnuch more extended
'powers. It gave the right ta the Board of
Railway Commissioners, not only ta locate
the line ai railway authoîized by Parliament, but ta refuse absolutely the using ai
the powers which had been granted by
PaTliament. In spite of this extraordinary
pro-cedure the Senate accepted the principle
af the Bill and sent it ta, the Raihway
Çornrittee. In the cornrittee it was found
that there is considerable dîveîsity ai
opinion as ta the propîiety of grantiug such
powers ta an irresponsible body which
would sit in judgrnent in appeal over the
action ai Paîliament, and a strong movemeut was apparent ini tavour of granting
those saine poweîs ta the Board of Railway Cornmissioners, but te, -be exeîcised

Hon. Mr. DAVID-Heer, hear; thet is
the point.

the Bill should not be reported. We deferred consideration practically over the
session. The Hydra-Electrie ai Ontario I
think had ample notice of our meeting. I
think they were notified specially when our
meeting would take place, and they neyer
showed us the courtesy ai being present.
Mr. Beck made a strong fight in the Honse
oi Commo'ns, and alter that went back ta
Toronto and neyer came back. The particu1er objection was to clause 3 of the Bill,
where they put in the hands ai the conmmission the power practically to veto legislation of Parliament. The clause reads as
iollows:

Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND-The Reilway
Committee was unenimously in fevour of
giving these pawers ta the Board af Railway Conunissioners, provided they were
exercised befare the House was sitting. I
canfess that personally I stood by my first

been denied by that irrespansible body.
I think the committee teck this view.
We adjourned those two Private Bills, and that the Parliament oi Canada should dethis amendmnent to the Reilway Act in the cide what was in the public interest. - So

of the press present, that we were feced but the Minister ai Railways approved pi

the chamber, but of the Railway Committee, that 1 cannot recail at the present
moment a more sympathetio disposition on
the part of members ta give their best consideratian to an important amendmient
than they did an that occasion, notwithstandig many of them were very strongly
opposed to the principle which At proposed
importing into the Act. It was a very
radical prinoiple. Even those o! us who
were sympathetic with the amendmient had
ta recognize that the immediate abdication,
se to speak, of Parliament, of its function
ta the Railway Commission to pass with a
degree o! finality upan the location was
certainly a un.ique prixiciple in railway
legisiation. I urged the amendment as
strongly as I possibly cauld, bath upon
the chamber and in the Railwayf Committee, and as I bave already said, I received
the mast sympathetic consideration o! the
principles embodied in the Bill. I discussed
the matter with the Minister of Railways
when the hon. gentleman from Mille les
suggested that the principle shauld be reversed, the submission ta the Railway
Board being made a condition precedent ta
the application for a Bill. We had then
reacbed a very late hour in the session, and
the Minister of Railways could not give
me any assurance that the adoption by the
Senate of that amendaient would be spproved of by his colleagues in the House
of Gommons, nlot only the Railway Coinmittee of the House of Gommons, but the
Government and the Hause af Gommons
itself. He agreed with me that, under the
as we had practically
circumstances,
reached the eleventh heur in the session,
and as the province of Ontario had not responded or attended the Railway Coamittee, and particularly the officiais interested
in the Hydro-Electrie, although natified,
we therefore were justified in saying that
the matter would receive our best attention
in the immediate future. The criticism just
read with reference ta this amendrnent is,
in my judgment, entirely indefensible, because 1 arn prepared ta say that the mernbers a! this Chamber, on bath sides af the
who ranged themselves in
House -those
favour af the amendmnent and those who
were for the tirne being opposed ta the
amendinent-were prepared ta give the mast
careful consideration ta the prop'osai that
had been made, and had we nat reached
such a late stage in the session 1 have nu
doubt we would have came ta a very satisfactory conclusion.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED.

Hon. '-\r. WATSON-I night say, in addition to what bas been stated by the hon.
leader, who hiad charge of this Bill as a
Governent measure, that hie informed us
that the M.ýinister of Railways would nlot

Hon. Mr. IOUGHEED-No.
Hon. Mr. SPROULE: I was just about
ta say that I think the blarne is properly
attachable ta the Railway Cornmittee, nlot
to the Senate. Any committee of this House
is in duty bound, accarding teoaur rules and
procedure, ta report every Bill sent to them
by the House, but in this case they falled
ta discharge their funictions and report the
