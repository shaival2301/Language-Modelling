Mater, being a member of the Board of
Regents as well as Chairman of the Committee
on Finance.
11e engaged extensively in business enterprises flot only in bis county but throughout
bis native province. 11e was bead of the firm

concern carrying on not only a general store
business but also extensive lumhering operatiens. H1e ivas also President of the New
Brunswick Telephone Company, an office front

H1e was summnoned to this Chamber in 1921,
and for tbc last twenty-four years was one of
its outstanding niembers, and was well known
to aIl of us. He took an active part in the
debates in the House, and was prominent in

Black and the other members of the family.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senaters, we mourn te-day the loss of two
highly rtspcted and valued members cf this
Chamber. to, mwom the leader has just referred,
Sentors Black and Cantley.
Senator l3lack's death came te me perscnally
ns a great shock. Altbouigh be may net have
1)00e in as good bealth as usual wbien we last
saw him, nevertbeless, hie did not seem to be
fniling. I nsked hirn during the last session if
hie would make a speech on the reinforcement
question, and hie kindly acceded to my request.
Honourable members wilI recaîl the cloquent.
concise nnd cery informative speech hie made
on tbat occasion.
The honourable tbe leader bas referred te,
the career of Senator Black, which is a most
remarkahle one. The late senator can truly
be termed a maker cf Canada. 11e started in
a humble way and became an outstanding
citizen cf the Province cf New Brunswick and
cf Canada, occupying a higb position net cnly
in business and financia] circles but in the

MARCH 20, 1945
academie world as wall. It is really wondierful
to think that dýuring the last great war, when
ha was nearing bis fifties, ha volunteered for
service oversa,
whera ha commanded a
brigade and was wounded. Bis very splendid
record was known to, Canadians generally. As
the leader lias so fittingly stated, lie served this
Chamber well for almost twenty-five years,
flot only in the Bouse itself but also in committees. The* passing of sucli an able and
distinguisbed gentleman will be a great lass
flot only to bis family but to, this Bouse, to
Parliamant, and ta the country as a whole.
I join with my honourable friand in conveying to, Mrs. Black andi the other mambers of
the family our mast heartfelt sympathy in
their bereavement.
I knew Sanator Cantley very well indapd.
As a member of the Union Government during
the last war, 1 saw him frequently. I was
glad to hear the leader of the Bouse refer to
the splendid advice wbich Colonel Cantley, as
lie than was known, gave the Government in
regard flot only ta steel and coal but also the
manufacture of shelîs. There was doubt in
the mind of the Goverament at that time as
to the ability of this country ta produce
shalîs; but thanks ta the splendidi information
possessed by Colonel Cantlay, whicli ha conveyed fraaly to the Govarnment and to the
then Prime Ministar, the Right Bonourable
Sir Robert Borden, the making of shahls was
started, and certainly it was a great
achievemient.
Senator Cantlcy lived to a ripa old age,
having passed the mark of four score years.
Although pliysically incapacitatad of lata,
mentally ha was just as alert as ever.
I join with my honourable friand and ail
those an this side of the Bouse in conveying
to the family of aur lata colleagua aur mast
sincere regret at bis passing.
Hon. GEORGE B. JONES: Honourable
senatars, I wish ta associate mysaîf with the
remarks made by the honourable leaders on
bath sides of this Bouse with refarenca ta the
passing of a colleague and old friand of mine,
Senator Frank B. Black. It has already been
pointed eut where lia was born and educated,
and what a deep interest lie took in Mount
Allisan University. Be was Ragent of that
University, and for years Chairman of its
Finance Cammittea, on whicli ha served' with
hanaur and g-reat distinction.
Senator Black had vary extensive business
interests. Be was not only a marchant, a
lumberinan and a manufacturer, but he carried
on a large farming business and was a growar
of livestock on his baau'tiful farms in and
around Sackville. I was associated with hlm in
32289-là

3

a numýber of large industries, and regarded hlm
as one of the most untiring and best business
men that I have known. The honourable
leader of the Government (Bion. Mr. King)
has mentioned that our late colleague was
President of the New Brunswick Telephon ie
Company, Limited, for ab-out twen'ty-five years.
He was also for forty-one years a director of'
that company, which from small beginnings
grew to a large enterprîse, efficiently operated'
and rendering excellent service to the province
of New Brunswick.
Reference has already been made to Senator
Black's excellent military record, and ta the,
fact ýthat ha was waunded in the last war. I
just touch on that ini passing.
Sanator Black -also took an active part in the
municipal life of Sackville. If I remembar
correctly, ha was Mayor of tbe town for two
tarms. He served too as a member of the
provincial Legialature, at a time when I happened to, be a fallow-mamber. Though of a
retiring nature, he was un active and very
valuable member of the Senate, and he tertainly will ha missed bera. He beld a very
important position as Chairman of our Banking
and Commerce Committee, over whose meetings ha prasided with ability, distinction and
fairnass.
I wish to join with lhe honourabla leaders in
expressing sincere sympathy to our late colleagua's widow, Mrs. Black, and her two sons
and thraa daughters.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourabla senators,were it flot that I was a fellow-townsman
of the late Senator Black for nearly fifty yeae
I should be quite content te associate mysaîfwith what h-as been said without making any remarks myself. Senator Black had a:
splendid foundation on which to start life. He
was of Old Country stock which, on bis father's
sida, came from Scotland as far b.ack as 1774,
and on bis motýher's side, from England. The
combinatian of Scotch and English produced
good qualities, and thesa hava shown throughout the whole family. I cannot quite remem'bar when bis father Joseph L. Black started
business. That was before there was a town
of Sarkvilla Be set up as a pioneer marchant
outside of the site cf the present town, without
any capital, his whole assats being industry,
persevarance and an indomnitahie will to suc-ceed. H1e became very successful. I have not
mucli parsonal knowledge of lis early years,.
but from as far back as I can remember Joseph,
L. Bla.ck was one of the outstsamding marchants ini tbat locality. Ha had a large country
store, and, as was said by tha honourabIa
gentleman wbo preceded me (Hon. Mr. Jones),

hie lot, only carried on a mercantile business
but soon became inferested in Iumbering and
agriculture. H1e was one of the first in our
part of the province f0 drain the waste marsblands and to convert [hem into rich soil for
the growing of hay. Wh-en bis family grew upbesides our late colleague lie had an-other son

companiv. and if has been carried on as such
ever since.
Senafor Black hiad rnany intcrcsts. It came
fo him natui-ally f0 nof only carry on ividespread business opera [ions but [o play an
active part in polities. His fatlier before hlmn
liad been a member of flic provincial legisiaturc. for af least one terni, if not ýtwo, away

Senator Black was a incmlir of the legisiature
froma 1912 to 1916, I tliink, and, as was said
by fthe bonouralile gentleman from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Joncs) lie took an active part in

we neyer bad an unkind word: from a personal

1 know bhis family very wclI, and I want to
join withi otlier honourable senators in extending f0 Mrs. Black and tlie o[ber members of
[lic family very sincere sympathy in thieir loss.
If looks [o me as if flic business that w-as
founded liy Josepli L. Black and carried on by

bave been paid fo liim liy the honourable

Hon. Mr. COPP.

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senafors, I ain sure we ail bave been impresscd by
[ho tributes paid to our twvo late friends,
Senators Black and Canfley.
I was particularly sfruck ifi
wbat ivas
said by tlie bonourable senator from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Joncs) and [lie lionourable gentleman from Wcstmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) witb
regard f0 our late colleague Senator Black.
Coming- as I do from [lie province of Nova
Scotia, 1 should like for a few moments [o
refer f0 our late lamcnted colleague, Senafor
Cantley.
Colonel Cantley was a figure in
Nova Scotia for sixty 3-cars, a striking figure,
not only in flic business world. but also in
ftic political world. As lie wvas a little older
flan I, lie perliaps lookcd upon me more or
lcss as a boy. In carlier days wben we w-ere
botli engagcd in strenuous occupations, we
used [o have our political differenees.
0f
course, we business men in Nova Scotia only
play pclitics for pleasure. Botb lie and 1 wcrc
business men, but w-e thouglit w-e owed it to
our commurnity and our country [o take a part
in ftic publie life of the province. In those
ypars we differed in polities, but I sincecly
believe tliat no man in Nova Scotia was more
rcspected iy flic pe ople of [bat province t ban
Colonel Cantley. For a number of years lie
was a rmember of flic bouse of Commons and
latrr camie to fliis Cliarber.

[broughout [tie United S[ates and Great

During tlie last war lie pla 'ved a
prominent, part. As mv lionouralile fricnd from
Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantynie) lias said, muembers of [lie Governimcnt of [bat day souglit
Colonel Cautle3-'s a(lvice on business matters,
real;iîng tliat it was sound and w-cil worth
foillowinig.
I becarne particularly fi-iendlv- shail I say?
-w itl olîr late colleag-ue in 1924 and 1925.
Colonel Cantle3- w-as a strong-mindcdi man
wlio. once bc liad reacliul a decision, w-as ready
fo fig-lit-not to tlie bitter end, but f0 tlie
fullest extent nrccessary to sustajn bis principles. I shial neyer forget our correspondence in those strcnuous days. H-is letters to
me wcre most cncouragiog and liclpcd mc [o
decide w-bat I sbould do in another place about
a very important question in whicli both lie
and 1 were vitally intercsted. From [bat time
forward both tliere and in [bis Chamber lie
and I were fast friends. We steercd cîcar
of those matters on wliicb we could nof agree,
and our personal relations werc sucli that with
the passing of [bis outstanding figure I feel
fliat [lic province of -Nova Seotia in parti-uliar
and the Dominion as a whole bave lost one
of their gros t sons.

MARCH 20, 1945
May I end my beartfelt tribute to my oid
friend by quoting these lines, 'which weil sum
up Colonel Cantiey's position in tbe business
and political life of this country:
Lives of great men ail remind us
We eaui nake our
And, departing, leavýe lives sublime,

Footprints on the sands cf time.
As à Nova Scotian and one who bas known
Colonel Cantley and his family for many
years, I extend ta bis relatives, flot only on
my own bebaîf, for I think I may include my
colleagnes f'romn Nova Scotia on bath sides af
the Hansc, aur dcepest sympatby in tbeir
great bereavement.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Hononrable senators, I shiould like ta add my tribute ta aur
departed colagues, but witb particular reference ta miy former desk-mate and colleague
from Nova Scotia, Colonel tbe Honourable
Thomas Cantiey.
As the honaurable senator fromn Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif) bas said, Colonel Cantley
was an ontstanding figure in the industrial and
commercial life cf the province of Nova Scotia.
And bis activities were net confined ta bis
native province; tbey extended tbronghout
Canada. fis contribution ta tbe steel and tbe
mainiog industry of Nova Scotia is weil known,
and bas been referred ta by tbe bonourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. King)
and the honourable leader cf the party on this
side (Hon. Mr. Bailantyne), Colonel Cantiey
may well be termed one cf the builders of
Canada. We need many Cantleys, for men of
bis type bave mado Canada what it is to-day.
A man cf strong convictions, be was courageans in upholding thcm. As the bonourable
senator frora I.nnenburg- bas sa well said,
wben Colonel Caudrcy took a stand an any
par[icular subJect lie fongbht for it-yes, ta the
end,
ColonA Cnntley was aise active in the political life of bis native province, Hie entered
the Huse of (Sommons in 1925-the same year
as I did-and was re-elected in 1926 and again
in 1930. H1e and I were appointed ta tbis
Cliamber at tbe samne time, and aur associations have always been most pleasant. It is
ta be regretted that an accident and impairment cf bis bearing prevented his taking an
active part in our deliberations. Otherwi-se you
would bave beard fromn him more frequently.
As tbe honourable member fromn Lunenburg
bias said, Colonel Cantley's advîce was always
available, and I can assure yen it was always
sound.
I sbould like to jein those wbo bave preceded
me in tendering deepest sympathy to tbe late
senator's relatives in tbeir great loss.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS

IN REPLT

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT moved
that au Address be presented to His Excellency
the Governor General te offer the humble
thanks of this House to His Excelleney for
the gracious speech which he has been pleased
to niake to both Huses of Parliament.
H1e said
on behalf
the leader
entrusted

(Translation): Honourable Senators,
of my compatriots I wish to thank
of the Government who bas kindly
te my modest capacities the task

of replying to the Speech from the Throne.
Life affords tasks which are pleasant to per-

form but which, at the same time, entail a
heavy

responsibility.

I

should

like

to be

equal te the task that lias been entrusted to
mie as well as to the cause for which we are
ail fighting with courage

and perseverance.

As stated in the Speech from the Throne, "In
Europe the Allied forces are rapidly advancing to what there is every reason to believe
will be decisive victory. Canada is prouder
than ever of the splendid achievements cf
hier fighting forces, at sea, on land, and in the
air."
Why are we sa, proud of our fighting forces?
Why have our fellow Canadians been so
valiant in combat? Is it flot because their
hpearts and seuls are buoyed up by faith ini
the freedom which it was desired to take away
frorn us? Our soldiers offer their lives se that
we rnay live .And if, after such efforts, sacrifices, and marks of devotion those gallant
soldiers see, on their return home, their
country divided, if they find a revolutionary
flame ablaze through the length and breadth

of our Canada, I wonder what aur berces will
think. Yet, in this moment, perhaps the most
solemn in our history, when all energies
should unite in a last effort for victory and
peace, there are in our midst extremists who
are engaged in disrupting our great Canada.
Those extremists, those fire-brands, wherever
they corne from, be it from the East, from

7

the Centre or from the West, are evil-doers,
and ail men of good will who love their country
should unite in a spirit cf staunch co-operation
with a vow te silence those fomenters cf
discord. I shahl refrain from naming any one
cf those individuals, ecause I wouhd thus confer on tbem toc much importance. I earnesthy
appeal te newspaper editors, who, are still
conscious cf their responsibility, te stop reporting and thereby magnifying aIl such calumnies,
shanders, and absurdities, which only stir up
ilI feelings and can do much harm te this
country. Because a hot-head, often one who
bas neyer achieved any succcss in if e except in
destructive work-because a hot-head in some
part of the country launclkes an attack against
another race, another seet, or another religion,
immediately some papers pick up such remarks
uttered by a crank and spread them througheut the country. An incendiary tcrch is thus
tossed into a building filled with inflammable
material. For what purpose are newspapers
repcrting. such utterances, which often are
untrue and always are exaggerated? For what
purpose are they doing that? I can sec just
cne, which is the more or less worthy domination cf fanaticism which, in dividing the
people, enables a amaîl group better te exploit
While the people squabble, heap
others.
abuse on each other, and even slaughter one
another, a handfuh cf exploiters iaugh and
set up their domination upon ruins. But it
dues nut matter, pride is satisfied. If they
are sincere in the right direction, if they
really love their country, ncwspaper editors,
whose task it is te disseminate ideas, wil
stop reperting such subversive speeches, and
instead they will fill the pages of their papers
with the words cf level-headed and wise men
who love their country, who want te sec it
beceme great, beautiful, and prosperous, but
who wish te promote its well-being by resorting to justice, charity and mutual love.
Complaints are voiced in some parts cf this
country about the province cf Quebec. In
that province. seme people dlaim that their
rights are net respected. On either side, thcre
are people who take advantage cf prejudices,
îvho shout, and even roar. I have neyer seen
any problem solved by shouting. But I have

as mueh entitled to live as I am. Let us not
forget that.
It does not behoove me to defend my province which has ailways donc its duty in the
past and which is as truc to-day as it will
be to-morrow. But if, showing good will, some
people tried to understand our feelings, if they
wanted to develop the self-reliance with which
we are endowed, they would notice how much
easier co-operation would bc. But there are
alvays small-minded people who thrive on
disunion, who are always on the watch and
who seem to be encouraged in certain quarters.
During my whole life I have advocated
co-operation; I have devoted all my energy and
my will-power to the furtherance of such a
co-operative spirit. To-day, with the full conviction of my soul and the whole ardeur of
my heart. I appeal to my compatriots and to
all Canadian citizens, urging them te practise
co-operation.
One priceless virtue of co-operation is that
it destroys nothing, elimsinates nobody, and
harms no one. On the contrary, in co-operating with mcv neighbour I work for his
good. That does net lower me in any way. it
deprives me of nothing, but it puts both the
one whom I help and msyself on the same
plane. The task that I could not carry out
alone can be fulfilled through co-operation with
my neigibour. Those heights which we cannot
reach alone, may be reached if we all get
together. Yeu. English-speaking Canadians,
who represent the majority of the citizens of
this country, hav e the power te do what you
please, but dlo you think that Canada will be
more prosperous and happier if beside you
there is a minority which always feels
oppressed?

found our co-operation on charity and to
eradicate pride from our minds.
A large number of citizens are yet unaware
that Canada is still part of the British
Empire thanks to the French-Canadians. In
1776, during the siege of Quebec, the governor
of the time advised those who did not want
to fight to take refuge on the island of Orleans
so as not to handicap the defenders. However
the Bishop of Quebec city appealed to the
Frencl-Canadians and pointed out to them
that it was their duty to defend their country
and to remain faithful to the British crown. In
1812, at Ciateauguay, again the French-Canadians, who were outnumbered fifteen to one,
saved the colony. Let us assume that in 1776
and in 1812 the French-Canadians had refused
te defend Canada. What would have happened?
Canada would not to-day be a British
dominion and we French-Canadians, what
would be our fate? If we who belong to
the two great races of Canada give serious
thought to these things, I am sure that we
will be able to get together, te agree and
to unsderstand one anothser.
The Speech from the Throne also says:
The Governmsssent has ae-cepted the invitation
to Canala to send reprseneitatives to a confer-

ence of the United Nations to be he'ld on April
2.5, at San Francisco, to prepare a charter for
a guneral international organization for the
maintenance of internationals-ace and secutrity.

Tie Cinais delegation will be ieacîrd
bv our Prime Minister who. I am proud te
saty, is of ail the prime ministers of Canada
the one wlso has brougit the greatest contribution to the peace and lariony of our
country and who will go down in history
as the king of the prime ministers of Canada.
It is a fine thing to prepare a charter for
a general international organization for tie
maintenance
of international peace and
security, but it is also a very difficult task.
Ail the United Nations will be represented at
tiat meeting.
Those nations include the
great and the small powers. Tiere are ai-o
the intermediate powers ieaded by Canada,
and to my mind it is Canada wlio will act
as iternsediary between the great poxers
and the smnall ones. Did not the Pope state
recsent ly that "iariiony betwcen peoples cannot offer any guarantee of stability unless
it is founded upon generosity"? He added
that at the end of this terrible war it wouild
be untiinkable that someone would seek te
derive special advantages from the peace
organization. He went on to say that "pride,
ambition and greed are the cause of the
present war." Turning te those who have
been blinded by an extreme nationalism and
bv violent racial theories, le appealed te
thiem to adopt ideals of Christian brotherhood.

MAROR 21, 1945
A rather prominent leader of modern times
said: "In this world there are two kinds of
men: the soft and the tough." And hie added:
"I belong to the second category." Well,
besides the soft and the tough, there are the
just, and they are the men .who will bring
about and maintain peace. Speaking of peace
would be nothing but idie talk if the law
of might were to prevail. It has been said
that might is flot right; however, it is through
co-operation in this sphere as in others that
mutual understanding will become possible,
and the international co-operation which we
propose to organize at San Francisco must be
steeped in the co-operation which Christ
taughit us, twenty centuries ago, when lie
said: "You shall love one another."
The great powers have the right to govern
themselves according to their lights, but so
have the intermediate and small powers. The
present war, which has lasted for so many
years already, was declared by a proud dictator
~who wished to subject the whole world to the
hegemony of hais own race. We cannot conceive
that those who have fought this man would
allow another dictator, whoever hie may be,
to utilize the same means to insure his own
domination.
Nations, great, intermediate or small, have
the right to live their own lives. It is both
necessary and useful that it be so, otherwise
ours would be a sad world indeed. Differences of race, mentality, belief and culture are
inevitable, but ail the vaxious races should
unite to contribute to a higher standard of
living for ail. Is not our presenit Prime Minister the very man to preach this doctrine
which has always guided his actions in our
midst? There is a common expression that
should, in my estimation, be eradicated from
every spoken language. You hear about the
"Struggle for life." Why not replace that
phrase by one which is more Christian, more
appropriate and more constructive: "Union for
if e."
In this living spirit of co-operation and
mutual understanding, I have the honour of
moving, the Addres-s in Reply f0 the Speech
from the Throne.
Hlon. W. MeL. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, the speech of His Excellency reflecfed, I believe, maffers that are uppermost
in the minds of the people of Canada-the
continuation of an ali-out war effort, and the
preparation for the, post-war future. The
en-couraging news fromn abroad and the encouraging statements from the British Prime Minister and others in authority lead us to hope
and believe that the massed weight of the
Ai'hied Nations is soon f0 bring us victory;
and as it does, I think our mindis should ever

and anon go back to the splendid record of
those fighfing men who s0 cheerfully and
bravely went froin this country to do their
share in this terrible confiet. During the last
war and this one it has been to me, if not perhaps f0, somte, a matter of wonder and a suhjeet of justifiable pride that these boys, drawn
from households and communities who knew
nofhing of war, from hoýmes wh'ich hated war,
were yef, able with on1.lva few months' training to render service on the battleield second
to non-e.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Look at their
record in the air, the daring and courage and
skiil with which they met the enemy, who had
been preparing for years, and drove him back
and swept him out of t he air with ahinost complete mastery. Think of the boys who neyer
saw the sea, whose nostrils had neyer known
the fang of the saIt sea air, but who with a
few mionths' preparation took over ships and
made a navy second to none, patrolling the
north Atlantic with ail its dangers, conquering
the LT-boats, and convoying our soldiers, our
airmen, and ail kinds of materials f0 the
other side. Examine the record of the boys in
the army, untrained in the art of war and
neyer taught to liste, how they mastered
the weapons of war, old and new, and time
after time met and drove before them the
trained legions of countries which for years had
been preparing for war. If this is not-a matter
of wonder, honourable senators, if is one of
justifiable pride that such biood runs in the
veins of our youth and that they have been
true f0 theýir tradition.
Heýre at home, iuspired by this spendid example, our people have established during
the past five years a magnificent record of
co-operation in the all-out war effort. Labour
has foregone many of its traditional rýights,
industry lias given the very besf of ifs talents
and ahi!ity and has accomplished marvels of
production. The farmers labouring under
great disadvantages, the fishermen and lumbermen, ail in their respective places, have contributed wilingly and efficientiy t.o the war
effort. And the womaen, of fhis country, tomn
as* we men are neyer torn wifh anxiefy for
loved ones far away and wifh their domestie
duties tremendously increased owing f0 regulafions which are necessary for war, even though
they have had litti-e time to spare, have given
willingly of their efforts. It is a splendid instance of co-operafion and willingness in which

Canada. We in this, country do flot have to
rebuild in a physical sense; but the impact of
war hias left deep wounds of another type,
which I helieve ail men of good will should
hasten to heal. No one can escape responsibility. That responsibility la on everyone, but
in greater degree perhaps on the members of
Ibis Chamber. Here are men of influence in
the industrial, financial and newspaper circles
of Canada. A great opportunitý is before us
to build up, flot to pull down; to say the kind
word, nlot the harsh word-to the end that war,
if it be at ail within aur ability to prevent it,
shall never again undermine our civilization.
It would bc a sorry spectacle indeed if after
our boys and girls of ail racial orngins and
relig-ious beliefs have so freely spilt their blood
in our defence, those who survive should find
on their return that we at home have been
so remiss in meeting our responsibilities that
we have permitted the country to be divided
into groups, with man's hand set against his
fellow man, and that once again those who
died for Canada have died in vain.
Honourabie senators, while 1 am seconding
the Address in repiy to the Speech from the
Throne I should like te, pay a personal tribute
to the man who by force of circumstances bias
disehargeci the heaviest responsibilities of
government during the past five years. It is
no easy matter to guide any demnocratic country through a period of total war, particularly
Canada with its diverse racial elements. Successful government of such a country calîs for
the highest type of statesmianship. Inevitahly
there was bound to, be criticism, and it would
be amaziag if soino of it aI least was flot
justified. But as we approacb whaî we hope
wi]l be the victorious conclusion of the war,
1 arn sure that the people of Canada can rest
happy in the refleclion that, under the prudent
and courageous leadership of Prime Minister
King. the administration hias been efficient and
bonest, and as a resuit, the prestige of Canada
lias reached a height unparalleled in hier
history, so that whatever the future may have
in store, in the yoars that lie ahead Canadians
can be proud of their country, proud of their
record. and can face the future with confidence.

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed froma Wednesday,
March 21, the consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mn.
Vaillüncourt for an Address in reply IheretoT.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, allow me first to offer my congratulations
ta the mover (Hon. Mr. Vaillancount) and the'
seconder (Hon. Mr. Robertson) of the Address.
I was flot able to follo* the mover as h4e spoke,
and did not know what hie had said until 1
got a translation of bis speech the nexî day.
I then found thal ta a great, extent I was in
sympatby witb the sentiments bie had expressed. I wisb to join in the tribute paid by
the seconder to our soldiers, sailors and airmen. As 1 speak to-night on the motion for
an Addness in reply to the Speech from the
Throne I feel very happy, because it seems
to me that any man who follows the news dispatches these days must realize that we are
approaching the end of the war in Europe.
All wbo have sons or brothers or fathers or
sisters aven there are now looking forward tla
the day whien they will return.
I will say nothing furtber about the war-.
We Canadians, of course, are proud of our
war effort, and espeeially proud of our men
in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.
Lt lias b-en said that the Air Force does not
win wars, and even thoug-li the Navy keeps
the sea lanes fairly open, we have to rely
on the men in the infantry to win final
victory. There may be fitten places than
this ta (1i5euss our war effort, but I should like,
to voice the opinion Ihat every member of'
this House, no matter what bis views on
other questions may be, is proud of the mera
and women who left aur country to take part'
ia what we believe ta be the greatest fight
for liberty in the history of the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hean.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am one of those who
think that certain things could have been done
betten. I think also that some Ihings could
have been donc better during the last war.
After that war was over we saw a lot of
mistakes that hiad been made. Mistakes have
been made in this war as well, but I arn

SENATE

persuaded that they were mistakes of the
hicad aed flot of the hecart, and that we wcre
whlceheartcdly behind the war effort. I know
that a number cf people in varicus parts cf
the country have cbjected to certain phases
4ýothe war effort, but I believo einmv hart
that if they Lad been schooied in the matter
as they xviii be schooled in the problems cf
peace, it wculd have been a differeet story.
In discuissing the Speech frern the Throne,
sp-akers on this aide usually say that the
Governiment have presented a long address
with nothing ie it. Ie this instance we find
the rusual practice reversed; we have a short
,address with a great deal ie it. This Parliamuent, unfcrtunately for seme, expires on the
l7th cf April, and a new Heuse cf Commons
wîll hav e to bc ciected. This, cf course, dees
members cf this
not affect honourable
Clîanibcîr. J do net think it needs a prophet
or the son cf a prepliet te tell honourable
senators, many cf whom are seasoeed parliamontarians and know the diffieulties cf
,getting re-elected, that ne matter hcw good
the Goverîîrnent',ý r cord niay have been there
will be a great change je the pcr-sennel cf the

there was an elertien for thc legisiature ie the
provifn
cf Manitoba we prcphesie( ilt at
there wcuid Le a fifty per cent change,'
and this prephery mas e cary aie ays berne
out. Undoubtediv, hv reason cf resignatiens
and deaths, and the icss cf conventions and
seas that were though t te Le safe, we shial
have a much more divided Parliament foliowing the general electien which. according
te the Speech from the Throee, is te be held
somne timie in the very near future. 0f course
honourable members cf this bouse are net
interested in elections je the same way that
members cf the Heuse of Commons are. As
senators we are net interested ie any one
party. Yeti mqy sav that the honourable
senator from Manitcha is interestcd ie the
Progressive Conservative party, or that the
senator from some place cisc is interested je
,another party; but, fiîndamentaiiy, wh.t we
are interested in is that the couetry should
,eleet te Parliarnent men and wcmien who wiii
be worthy to carry on the tradition cf Canada
as upheid hy our men and womon who have
given their lives fer it. That is ccic situation,
and J am persuaded that for rncny years te
,come the future cf thi-. country xviii te a
large extent depend ce the policies cf the
Government je office during thc ncxt five \'ers.
If these pelicies are sound tbey xviii benefit
our people.
As I si.the
war in Europe is drawing te a
close. It is generaliy feit that if the Aliied
Nations Lad net insisted ce uncenditional surrender Germany xvouid have capituiated

months ago. It is a time cf aexious suspense
and je the years te corne parents whose sens
may make the supreme sacrifice in the concluding stages cf the war on the western front
may Le pardcned if they feel that it would
have been hetter had Germany been graeted
certain termas cf surrender. Bu~t the Aiiied
Nations arc taking the long, view and are
determined net te repeat the mistake made in
1918-a mis take which bhas involvcd us in
this secnd world war. As the Prime Minister
statcd in another place, reports froma both the
western and castere fronts are se favourable
as te indicate an eariy coilapse cf German
military power. I arn net one cf those who
take a very sericus view cf the Japanese xvar.
Truc, the Japs may fight te the doatla on their
home islands, but there is no question in rny
mind that the struggle je the Pacifie xviii be
cocluded mueh sooner than at cee tirne
supersemed possible, for ocr ovcrwhelir
îority je both naval and air strength is boued
te ha.11ten the end cf Japanese resistance.
Let me now pass te something that I desire
te hring te the attention cf honourabie mcmbers. 1 do net believe tbat either the Geverenment or othor responsiblo authorities are properly prepared for peace. Beth Liherals aed

W/hon or service men and womee corne

fellews? Some of them were junior clerks;
others had just left sehool or had not yet
cempleted their university courses. Tlie same
remarks will apply te our young fellows in the
Navy. At the outbreak of war our Navy persennel did flot exceed 4,000. To-day it numbers some 150,000 or 160,000. My lionourable
friend the "Admiral," across the way (Hon. Mr.
Duif), will be able to give us the exact figures.
Tliose young sailoýrs, soldiers and airmen will
soon be retcrning to civil life, and I fear that
the country is not ready te ment tlie situation.
It mcst get ready without delay. A large
number cf our industries are prepared to
change from war production to their former
businesses, or te, undertake new ones. Tliose
industries will bc able to absorb a large number of our yeung veterans; but tlie home
market will net take care of the increased
output, and we must dispose of ocr surplus
preduction in the markets of the world. In
short, we must stimulate and encourage trade
and commerce.
Before I go fcrther into that subjeet I
should like for a moment to deal with our
system. cf taxation as it affects free enterprise.
You cannot scbject industrial and commercial
undertakings to a tax of 80 per cent-as a
matter of fact the Government takes 100 per
cent, but promises to return 20 per cent-and
hope te see them expand. It may be said
in seme quarters that the members cf this
House represent capitalism. They do net.
I arn convinced that of its membership at any
time at least 90 per cent hàs by its own
enterprise and energy risen from humble
beginnings te well-merited scccess. Certainly
any lionoura;ble members who bave acqcired
wealth have done se by liard work and good
business judgment. Heavy taxation destroys
the incentive te embark on new undertakngs
or te develop old ones. Great Britain lias
found that oct. British taxation is heavy,
but industry is encouraged, and is given a
chance te survive and develop.
0cr income tax lias two bad features: the
exemptions are s0 lew that it is difficcît for
parents te educate and train their children;
the maximum rates are se heavy as to
destroy ahsolctely any incentive a man or
woman may have to earn special or extra
income. Those two drawbacks must lie rectified, and rectified soon.
I do net prophesy when the war in Europe
will be over; nobody dees; but if we can
judge at sîl from reports, it sliould be over
in six months from now, maybe mchl seoner,
perliaps in six weeks. Now is the time wlien
we ouglit te be getting ready for thie turnover from wartime ýte peacetime industry, sn
as to be in a position te encourage enterprise

13

after the war ends, The Socialists say, "if
the executives do nlot previde employment,they are to blame, and we shail take over."
If you make the burden on industry so lieavy
that no one cares to risk his capital, you will'
prevent private enterprise.
Let me give you an illustration. In the
city of Winnipeg there is a man who estab-lished a business some fifty years ago, wheu
lie was about twenty-two years of age.
1eý
had a good name, lie was said to be lionest,.
and lie possessed lots of energy. H1e is in;
the automobile business now. Lagt year theincome from lis business was $186,000, but
lie was allowed to keep only $40,000, and hehad te pay personal income tax on that. Wliat
mncentive is there for anyone to start a nevw
enterprise when, after paying such heavy corporation taxes, one is stili subi et to personal
income tax? Net a dollar of that man's
income was made eut of the war effort.
That is the kind of situation we face in
this country, and that is the first thing whicli
must be rectified. So far there lias been no
attempt to rectify it. It is true that last
vear the inceme tnx law was slightly amended
witli respect to valuations and write-offs, but
no serious attempt lias been made to give
.indcstry a chance to carry on.
In order to be able te dispose of the goods-ý
whicli tlie industry that we now liave in this:
country will be ahle to produce after the war,
we shaîl have to sell on the markets of the
world. Right now ocr best business men
ought to ho in those countries where we hopeý
to seIl our gonds; they should be studying.
the requirements there se, as to be able tetell us what to do in order, to meet cernpetition successfully. I hardly like te say
this, but I do net believe that committees
such as the one that was headed by the
Principal of MeGilI University are going top
mean very mcl. True the Principal cf McGilf
is a fine man, and bas great ability; but the
problem that such bodies are attacking is not
the chief one that we have to face, whicli is:
How are we going te get markets for our
industry? For only te the extent that we are
able te get m'arkets shall we be able te ýmamntain our indixstry.
A second great probleem is this: Where are
we going te seli 0cr cattle, our grain and our
hogs after the war? In Western Canada, in thelast five years--I see the honourable genitleman from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.Beaubien) listening te me, se I had better lie
careful with my figures-in the last five years,
or certainly in the last ten, years, because of
the development of power farming in the
West, we have prodcced, with tlie same labour,.
twice as mcl grain as we did before. What.

MARCH 27, 1945N
There are some things about the situation
that 1 do flot like. Again I speak with
humility because I amrnfot such an expert
that I can express a firm opinion; but I think
I ought to z,,y I lo nlot like t_ýe wny the
Yalta conf.'rcnce dLÈali with the Pl'oes.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They were overrun
first of ail by the Russians and then by the
Germans. Poland was the first nation that
etood by Great Britain at the beginning of
the war with Germany. Churchill, Roosevelt
and Stalin may have made the very best agreement possible; no doubt they did-I have no
douht that even if I had been there I sbould
have fallen in line and agreed witli thembut in my heart of hearts there is a feeling
that the Poles have nlot got a deal that we
as freedom loving people can .iustify to ourselves. It ia my hope that at the peace table
they will get aucli a deal.
Coming back to the California conference,
I understand the Government is going to
appoint men and women fromn the House of
Commons, and probably two members of this
House. They should go to the conference
dedicated to the task of carrying out their
responsibilities in such a way that future
generations will nlot have to suifer as this
generation has suffered. Only those of us
who have our own boys overseas know what
a terrible trial we go through. We tbink of
thcm aIl day, from the time we get up in
t.he morning until we go f0 bed at night.
Man or woman it is exactly the samne, and if
any pretend they do not, and won't admit it,
they are only deceiving tbemselves.
Now, honourable senators, we have a chance
at San Francisco. It may be a sanl chance;
we are but a smaîl nation. The great nations
have tremendýous power, mayhe too much
power, and the outcomc may be dependent on power politica; but in my judgment
anything that can get the United States,
Russia and Great Britain-and prohably
France and Cbina-around the table and get
tbem to agrce on a formula., will at least
resuit in a better world than we had before
the Firat Great War. The men and women
who go from Canada to that conference will
be sitting down with some of the great people
of the world-perhaps nlot Stalin or Churchill
or Roosevelt, but the regular people--and
with the>m can work out this peace organization. Anyone can get up and criticize proposaIs with reference to this conference. You
may flnd fault with thîs agreement by the
hour. You may say it is not democratie. You
may say that Canada wiIl be called upon to
provide so many men and so mucb money for
the settlement of disputes, But that is flot so

at ail; there ia to be a police force to deal
with sucb cases. In my judgment each member
of this Chamber believes it is a atep toward
world peace and a means of preventing wars
in~ the futu:-c
1 wiil flot go i:,to that an.y
furt1ier, cxcel t to say ihat I believe the
people of Canada as a wbole are seized with
1he importance of this conference. It is flot
a peace conference. Those who go there
will have difficulty in reaching an agreement.
We may be d'issatisfled. It may be that the
Prime Minister, if hie goes there, wi!l nlot get
what be wants, or that those who, go fromn the
ýother aide will nlot yet what they want; but
ail will go with determination and hope that
peace shall reign in the world forever after.
I could read. you an extract from a newspaper wbichi states that in the haut tbouaand
V cars xvars havc been going on haîf the timie.
bhat is prohably correct. But there is stili
the chance that this time we may be rîght.
Honourahle members, I thank you for your
attention. I hope I have said notbing that la
in derogation *of our great war effort. My
thoughts have been animated soiely by wbat
ia good for Canada. We in this House have
no pohitical interests t.o serve. We may have
an interesst such as you migbt find whe're there
is a conteat for mayor, and somehody la elected
and somebody cisc is not. But hy and large,
to us it matters little who may ait in the House of
Commons. We should think of Canada and
the sacrifices she bas made, firmly believing
that in the future we may be one of the great
nations who stand for peace.
Hon. J. H. KING: I join with my hononrable friend opposite in congratulating the
mover and seconder of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. I .think it la
generally agreed that they acquitted tbemselves most credita-bly. While reading their
speeches it occurred ýto me that those two
gentleman might easily have exchanged notes,
hecause their speeches are fairly well along the
same line. If one read what they bad to say
in dealing with the war one would! find that
they wexe in very close agreement. They botb
spokze of the value of the principhes of fair
play and justice and the necessity that these
should prevail througbout the world at. this
time. I amn sure that when this Parliament
returne to, the consideration of peace-time
matters and legisiation of firet importance te,
the people of Canada, those two honourable
gentlemen will be very valuable members, net
onhy in débate in this Cha-mber but in the work
of committees of this House.
My bonourable faiend who bas just taken
bis seat MHon. Mr. Haig) bae refrained from
controversial discussion. May I say -that in
this I think bie was wise. It is of course well

SENATE
understood that in ordinary circumastances this
Parliament would have been dissolved last
January, at the end of its fifth session, for a
sixth session is virtually without precedent.
The successful landing of our troops in
Normandy, followed by the lightning drive
across France, encouraged hope flot only iii
this country but among ail the allieci nations
that Germany would be forced to give up the
st.ruggle some time last autumn. Unhappily
that hope was flot realized. But to-day the
German army is on the run on both the eastern
and western fronts, and is disin.tegrating so
rapidly that ýthe Reich mnay be forc-ed into unconditional surrender within a few weeksýý-the
sooner the better. But even before these decisive events I think the Prime Minister had in
mind that the war might have reached such
a stage that it would be possible to hold an
election early this spring and have the n.ew
Parliament assemble in June or July. Two
events, how.ever, intervened: first, the invitation to the Government of Canada to attend
the San Francisco conforence on the 25th of
April, to which my honourabie friend has
referred, and the intpending Victory Loan.
In view of the delay that must of necessity
now take place in arranging for a general
eiection, the Covernment decided in their
wî-.dom-and in mv opinion thoy should be
commended for it-to summon ParIiament for
a sixth sesýion, for tw o pqrticular purposes.
The first is to ii<oiss the ix itation to attend
tiîc San Francisco confcrece; the second. to
pass interim suppiy to mieet wvar and civ il
exponditures during the period which must
intervene between a general election and the
summoning of a new Parliament. I shall not
venture to prophesy what changes the next
eection mav bring about in the other House.
1 have attended quite a number of prorogations, andi they are always occasions for
sadiness. as members who hav e been associated
in legiative work for four or fixe years take
leave of one another. On tbis occasion that
sadness is intensified by the knowledge that
some members wvii1 fot seek re-election, others
wili faul to secure nomination, and stili others
wvill suifer defeat ait the pois.
Oniy by extending the lufe of this Parliament
can an election be postponed, but the Prime
Minister's views in this regard are well known.
He is strongiy opposed to any such extension,
in order that the Government may carry on
the business nf the country, and I fuliy agree
with him. The whoie situation shouid be
canvassed in a general election, so that the
electorate mâ.y have an opportunity of registering its desires. The new Parliament, as my
honourable friend has said, will in ail probaHon. Mr. RING.

bility have to iaY down policies that mnay
affect Canada for many years to come, because those policies wiil deal with peace-time
prohlems, the satisfactory solution of which
will be of very great importance to this country.
I do not intend to-night to go into the.
respective merits of Socialism, Conservatism,
or Liberalism. They will ho discussedi on the
hustings, and I have implicit confidence in~
the judgment of the Canadian people.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

lIon. Mc. KING: My honourabie friend has
stated that the people in his province know
more about Socialism than those in any other
part of Canada. I happened to be a member
of the legisiature of Britishî Columbia which
met in Victoria in 1903,Hon. Mr. HAIG: I said the four western
p)rovinices know more about it than any of
the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. KING: Thon 1 concur in wliat
my honourable friend bas said. I remember
very well w'hen I attended the provincial
House in Victoria in 1903 forty-two years
ago. That was the first pacliament of the
proviînce in whichi we had a party goverfiSic Richard MeBricle was roturned
ment.
with a foilowing of twenty-onc Conservatives,
minthe Liberals mustercd seventeen members.
The mnember for Nanaimo, a Welshman, knew
more about the doctrines of Kari Marx and
could preachi thcem botter than those who toda 'v are prcaching therm in this country. Ho
liai six or cighit colleagues, ail very firm in
ilicir beliefs and wvcll able to present them to
thie iegislatuire. They at that time preached
the doctrines that are being pceached to-day.
I cmr not so much disturhed by those in Canada
if they wiil only stick
vhio preach Soeialisis,
to their text. Lot them teil the people xvhat
oinm mc ans-regimentation and control
of industry, banking, and business generaiiy,
and that the property of the individuai xviii
become the pcoperty of the State-and I am
confident th'it our people wili rejeot Socialism.
Hon. Mc. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. KING: But if our people are toid
only that the oo-cailed big interests are to be
controlled, they may feul to undorstand that
once the process of socializing our great instrial, commercial and financial institutions
du0
is put into effeot it wviil not stop thero but
xvill most certainiy extend to ail private
interests, and the people xviii beconxe mereiy
servants of the State, with freedom only to
do what a Socialist gox'ernment orders them
to do.
I have çlrifted fromn what I wish to say,

MARCH 27, 1945
My honourable friend opposite thinks that
in the matter of taxation we are not yet prepared for the return to peacetime industry. It
can be readily understood that one of our
great problems in the war period has been how
best to finance Canada's war effort. I believe
that all who have studied finance and
taxation in other countries at war are agreed
that Canada has done very well. We have
paid for about fifty per cent of our actual war
expenditures, and the balance has been loaned
by the people. It cannot be denied that
Canada stands to-day in a very strong position for a nation which bas gone through five
and a half years of war. A day or two ago
Mr. Graham Towers, the Governor of the
Bank of Canada, issued a statement from
which it can be seen by anyone who reads
it that we have done well, not only in the
matter of taxation but also in our borrowings,
and by financing within Canada the full burden
of our 'war effort.
My honourable friend made some reference
to industry and trade. It is only natural that
we should have some discussion on this. He
will recall that during the last session of
Parliament the Government took steps to
assist exporters. There has been set up a
financial organization that will materially aid
business concerns which undertake to dispose
of their goods in countries where at present
buyers are probably unable to pay cash. A
great opportunity has been given to industry
in this way. Furthermore, the Government
has been active in extending Canada's representation in foreign countries, and to-day this
country has able men, either as ambassadors or
ministers plenipotentiary, in many parts of the
world. These men are in a position to keep
the Government advised as to opportunities
for trade, and I have no doubt that the information thus obtained is one of the services
made available to Canadian exporters. We
also have our trade commissioners. I believe
that during the war this branch of our foreign
service has not been extended, except to some
South American countries. The European
countries have of course been "blacked" out
and there has been no opportunity for development of trade with them.
If the war should come to an end within a
few weeks the Allied nations would be faced
with a great problem in providing necessities
for the people of the countries that have
been overrun. Unless everything possible is
done to render relief in those countries serious
disturbances may develop, and what is worse,
many people will probably starve to death. I

17

am sure we are all conversant with this fact
and know that our people are desirous of doing
their share towards providing' relief. Fortunately we have in the Allied nations a great
organization for making relief effective. If
ever there was in the world an organization
capable of relieving the needs of stricken
countries it is the one that exists among the
Allied powers to-day.
I do not intend to speak to-night on the
San Francisco conference, but I hope to have
an opportunity to-morrow of moving a resolution dealing with the matter. As my honourable friend has said, it undoubtedly will be
the desire of all members of this Parliament
and of all the people of Canada to support
to the utmost of their power an organization
that will give an assurance of peace and of
better conditions for all the nations of the
world.
As to supply, I feel there will not be occasion for us to debate that in this Chamber.
The Government simply intends to ask for
certain sums of money to provide for financial
needs from the 31st of March until the
assembling of a new Parliament. There are
only two matters to be dealt with at this
session. One is the request for concurrence
in the Government's action in accepting the
invitation to attend the San Francisco conference, and the other is the request to provide
funds to carry on the war during the interval
between the end of the fiscal year and the
assembling of the next Parliament. I am sure
that these two matters will be dealt with
expeditiously by the members of both Houses,
and that the nineteenth Parliament will not be
concluded by a political session. After all, there
will be plenty of opportunity on the hustings
to talk polities.
I have no more to say. It is hoped that if
other honourable members desire to speakand the field is one in which many speeches
could be made-they will proceed some time
this week or next week. It is difficult to decide
when the Senate should adjourn, but to-morrow
we may have information that will enable
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) and me to arrive at an agreement
with regard to our work for the remainder of
the session, and to make proposals that will
best serve the interests of the Senate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CONFERENCE
MOTION
Hon. J. H. KING moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parlianient tIo approve the folowing resolution:
Whereas the Government of Canada bas been
invited by the Goveriiment of the United States
of Anerica, on behalf of itself and of the
governments of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republies and the Republie of
China, to send represontatives to a conference
of the United Nations to be held on April 25,
1945, at San Francisco in the United States of
America to prepare a charter for a general
international organization for the maintenance
of international peace and security, and
h
W ereas the invitation suggests that the conference consider as affording a basis for such
a charter the proposals for the establisfiment
of a general international organization wbich
have been made public by the four governments which participated in the discussions at
Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, and

Whereas

the

Goveronment

of

Canada

bas

accepted the invitation to send representatives
to this confore nce,
Therefore be it resolved:
1. That this House endorses the acceptance by
the Government of Canada of the invitation to
sond representatives to the conference;
2. That this House recognizes that the establishment of an effective international organization for the maintenance of international peace
and security is of vital importance te Canada,
and, indeed, to the future weli-being of inankind; and it is in the interests of Canada that
Canada should becone a nceiber of sceh an
orgaiiization;
3. That this House approves the purposes and
principles set forth in the proposals of the four
goveriiments, and considers that these proposais
constitute a satisfactory general basis for a
discussion of the charter of the proposed international organization;
4. That this House agrees that the representatives of Canada at the conference should use

their bést endeavours to further the preparation
of an acceptable charter for an international
organization for the maintenance of international peace and security;
5. That the charter establishing the international organization should, before ratification,
be submnitted to Parliament for approval.
He said: Honourable senators, it will be
recalled that in the Speech fron the Throne
there was a paragraph indicating that a resolution of this character would come before both
Hon. Mr. KING.

Houses of Parliament. I need not attempt to
influence honourable members in favour of
the objects set forth in this resolution. I am
confident that it is the desire not only of
Parliament but of the people generally that
Canada should be represented at the proposed
conference called for the establishment of a
general international organization to ensure
the maintenance of international peace and
security. The Government of Canada has
accepted the invitation of the Government of
the United States to attend the conference on
the 25th of next month, and is now asking
Parliament to concur in its action.
Doubtless alil honourable members are
familiar with the terms of the resolution, so
I will not delay our proceedings by reading it,
I should like, howevcr, to have incorporated
in Hansard the correspondence relating to the
initation and its acceptance which passed
belween the United States Ambassador to
Ctanada and the Prime Minister in his caipacity
as Secretary of State for External Affairs.
This is the correspondence:

Office of the Secretary of State
for External Affairs
Ottawa, Mareh 5, 1945.
Sir,-The Government of Canada is pleascd to
accept the invitation conveyed in your Note
No. 293 of March 5, on behalf of the governments of the United States of America, the
United Kingdorn of Great Britain and Northero
Irelaud, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republies
and the Republic of China to scnd representatives to a conference cf the United Nations tai
be held on April 25. 1945, *at San Francist-o to
prepare a charter for a general international
organization for the maintenanc2 of international peace and security.
The Government of Canada agrees that the
conference should accept as a basis for its
discussions the proposais for the establishment
of a general international organization, whieh
were made public in October, 1944~ and have
now been supplemented by the addition set
forth in your Note of provisions regarding
voting procedure in the Security Council.
Note has been taken of the offer of the Government cf the United States of America to
transmit to other participating governinents
such views or comments concerning the proposais
as the Government of Canada may desire te
present in advance of the conference. I shahl
communivate with you again if the Government
of Canada decides to take advantage of this
offer.
Accept, sir. the renewcd assurances of my
bighest consideration.
W. L. Mackenzie King,
Secretary of State for
External Affairs.
His Excellency
The Hon. Ray Atherton,
Amibassador of the United States
cof America,
United States Embassy,
Ottawa.
When, in September, 1939, the German
army invaded Poland, Great Britain and
France declared war against the Reich. Unhappily, in the early years of the war
France succumbed, leaving Great Britain to
carry on the fight. Later on the United States

of America became involved, and the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republies entered the conflict when Hitler directed bis armed strength
against Russia. It bas, been a long and stupendous struggle, but at last Germany is going
down to defeat.
During the war years several

conferences

have been held between the leaders of the

19

Allied nations. The first, known as the Atlantic Conference, took place between Prime
Minister Churchili and President Roosevelt.
The principles there laid down are well known

to us all. They have a bearing on the motion
no'w before us. Those principles were accepted
in the conference at Moscow, when Prime
Minister Churchill visited Mars-hal Stalin.
Last faîl there was the Dumbarton Oaks meeting; and earlier, at Casablanca, arrangements
were made for the invasion nlot only of Sicily
but Italy. There wàs also the Conference at
Teheran, in Iran, where the two great Englishspeaking leaders met Marshal Staliýn, and made
plans for joint action against Germany on both
the eastern and western fronts. The holding of
these conferences bas been an amazing thing
in itself. During the last war it ivould not
have been possible for the Allicd leaders to
travel surh great distances and confer from
time to time on matters pertaining to the war.
It is interesting to note that while thiis
world war has been at its greatest height the
leaders of the United Nations-I speak nlot
only of the four great powers but aIl the
nations that bave been associated in the warbave bad it in mmnd that there should be such
a conference as is, now to meet at San Francisco,
a conference not te frame peace terms, for
that is not its purpose, but te try to develop
plans and proposais that will assure peace to
the world.
I really do not know why, but into the
discussion of this conferece there bas been
introduced-partieularly in the press, I believe
-some question as to tbe attitude or position
of the other British Com.monwealth nations
towards Great Britain. It seems to me that
this is prctty mucb like whipping a dead
horse. The promoters of that kind of controversy are not contributing mucS to tbe
discussion. Some years ago a great Englisb
poet who bad a tborough knowledge of the
Empire and Imperial conditions expressed in

poetry Canada's position within the Empire.
I am not sure. that I can quote the lines, but
as I recaîl tbem they went something like
this:
Daughter arn I in my mother's bouse;
But mistress in my own.
That was the situation many years ago, but
since then we have progressed considerably.
We know of the position that was taken by
Sir Robert Bordoen during the first Great War
and afterwards, and we know that since that
time the progress in the relations between
Canada and Grcat Britain Sas been evolutionary in nature. At the Imperial Conferences

of 1926 and 1930 a definite understanding was
reached, which resulted in the Statute of Westminster. There seems to be a disposition to
fear that if Canada and the other nations of

SENATE
this great Commonwealth set in the light oi
their responsibilities ai nationhood, tbe great
Empire to wbicb we are ail se proud te
belong wiil ha destroyed. Vieil, my belief is
thet it bias been demonstrated to the whoie
xvorld thet the ries that bind the peoples oi the
overseas Dominions to the people of Great
Britain are not breakable. Wbenever the
occasion arises the whole Empire will respond
as one. Yet Canada is mistreas in bier own
housa, in ail ber own affaire. That is agreed
to, and eoaceded, not only by our owa statesmen and mnr people in geaccal, but by the
people and the Govarniment of Great Britain.
For lthe purpose of clarifying my statement
a bit I would read int Haasacd, iromn the proceedings of the lest Impeciai Conference whieb
tbe present Prime Minister bad the bonour
and privilege of atranding, a iew bni portions
of tue deliberations as to this very question of
tua position that the Dominions and Great
Britain sbould pcopecly take in the event of an
international assambly sueb as the one about
te be bield. On that occasion Mn. Ring bad

3. To achieve international co-operation in
the solution of international economie, social
and other humanitarian problems; and
4. To afford a centre for harmonizing the
actions of nations in the achievement of these
common ends.
Chapter II deals with principles and reads:
In pursuit of the purposes mentioned in Chapter I the Organization and its members should
act in accordan'e with the following principles:
1. The Organization is based on the principle
of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving
states.
2. All members of the Organization undertake, in order to ensure to all of them the rights
and benefits resulting from membership in the
Organization, to f9lfil the obligations assumed
by them in accordance with the Charter.
3. All members of the Organization shall settle
their disputes by peaceful means in such a
manner that international peace and security
are not endangered.
4. All members of the Organization shall refrain in their international relations from the
threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent
with the purposes of the Organization.
5. All members of the Organization shall give
every assistance to the Organization in any
action undertaken by it in accordance with the
provisions of the Charter.
6. All members of the Organization shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against
which preventive or enforcement action is being
undertaken by the Organization. The Organization should ensure that states not members
of the Organization act in accordance with these
principles so far as may be necessary for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
Chapter III deals with membership, and
provides that:
Membership shall be open to all peace-loving
states.
Chapter IV sets out the organization as
follows:
(a) A General Assembly.
(b) A Security Council.
(c) An international court of justice; and
(d) A Secretariat.
The booklet then proceeds to deal with that
organization in detail.
Chapter V deals with the General Assembly. It is so imporfant that I would ask permission to place it on Hansard. It provides:
Section A: Composition.
All members of the Organization should be
members of the General Assembly and should
have a number of representatives to be specified
in the Charter.
Section B: Functions and Powers.
1. The General Assembly should have the

members of the Organization or by the Security
Council: and to make recommendations with

21

regard to any such principles or questions. Any
such questions on which action is necessary
should be referred to the Security Council by
the General Assembly either before or after
discussion. The General Assembly should not on
its own initiative make recommendations on
any matter relating to the maintenance of international peace and security which is being
dealt with by the Security Council.
2. The General Assembly should be empowered
to admit new members to the Organization upon
recommendation of the Security Council.
3. The General Assembly should, upon recommendation of the Security Couneil, be empowered to suspend from the exercise of any

the Security Council, the Secretary-General of
the Organization. It should perform such
functions in relation to the election of the
judges of the international court of justice as
may be conferred upon it by the statute of the
court.
5. The General Assembly should apportion
the expenses among the members of the
Organization and should he empowered to

Hon. Mr. EULER: That was very clearly

lion. Mr. KING: I do flot believe that is
the intention. A great power will be subject
to the same treatment as a secondary power.
The action taken will, I suppose, depend upon
the ability of the other nations to proceed
against the delinquent nation.
Chapter VII descrihes the constitution ai
the International Court of Justice. It would
function in accordance with a statute to be
annexed to and iorming part of the charter
af the organization. This court would deal
with international problema and would ha
either a continuation of the present Permanent
Court of International Justice or a tribunal
based upon it.
It is proposed that the Sccurity Couneil shahl
ha eomposed of five members, one from each of
the five great powers, these representatives ta
bc elected from the Assembly, as I have
already stated. I have alreedy mentioned
the systern of voting in the Council. Naturàlly there will have ta be a secretariat, and the
suggestion is that it should function continuausly.
A question that has heen disturhing the
minds of some people is: What will the Canadien delegation do at San Francisco? What
poivcr will it have ta enter into any agreement or undcrtaking? We are gaing there as
a body, made up af representatives of political
parties in Parliament, ta represent the people
ai Canada, and I take it that the delegation
will meet frarn day ta day and decide what
position Canada should adopt an matters that
corne hefore the Assernhly. Any undertakings
made by Cenadýa's representatives wvill have ta
be suhmitted ta Parliamrent for ratification.
As regards the question ai whether or nat
Canada would be satisfied ta allow a delegatian
froma Parliament ta enter into ca.ntracts with
,the Security Council for aur participation in
future wers, if there should ha any, I wish ta
explain xvhet ie proposed. Our commitrnents
ta the Security Council will ha submitted ta
the Parliament ai Canada for appraval. What
I mean is that if the Security Cauncil says
that it would like ta have £rom Canada a
certain number ai airerait, ai airmen, ai traaps
and ai ships, and certain quantities of food
procLucts, munitions and se on, the matter
will ha discussed, and the decision that is
reached will ha expressed in a separate agreement which will came before Parliament for
ratification. Sa there need ha no worry et al

2.3

on this score. We know the attitude ai the
Canadien people tawards war. They have
neyer gone ta war just for the fun ai it; they
have gane ta wer only when canvinced there
was no other way af deiendîng thase principles
of justice and fair play in which they helieve.
I repeat that any undertakings made et San
Francisco by the Canadien Gavernment or
delegation will ha submitted ta Parliament,
and there ha finally endorsed or rejected.
Ia closing I just wish ta express my heliai
that the people ai Canada hope the invitation
ta attend the San Francisco conference will
ha accepted unanimously hy Parliament, and
thet those who are entrusted with the duty
ai representing us et the conierence will keep
in mind the Canadien viewpoint in regard ta
wer. We are not interested in war as e
means ai conqucet. We wilI nat hecame participants in war unless that seerns ta us to
ha the only way ai defending that freedamfreedomn ai religion, freedom ai the Press,
and so on-whîch exists not only in Canada,
but virtually thraughout this hemisphere. We
regard freedoma as the most highly prized
thing in lufe; and if it is ta be extended ta
athar nations, as wa trust it will ha, it is important that -there shoýuld hca efeirer distribution ai the worlds riches arnong ail peoples and
n greater appartunity for unrestricted trede.
Let us hope that with the extension ai the
henefits of ireedarn ta other lands there will
ha increased support for thosa great principles
which we are deterrnined ta maintain.
Han. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Hon ourable
senetors, we are living from hour ta hour
and day ta day through rnast thrilling and
mamentous times. We ail feel and realize
that Germeny, which forced this cruel, devestating, barbarie war upan us, is nearing ultimata defeet and unconditioal surrender. Haw
fitting it is, then, honourable senetars, that
iorty peace-loving united nations, or rneyhe
a greeter number, are called ta meet et San
Francisca on April 25 ta lay plans for the
preventian af wars and the future peace ai
the warld. Almoat the whole ai Europe hec
heen devesteted, and famine and pestilence
preveil everywhere on the continent. The
world has neyer witnessed in the past, and
I hope it will neyer witness in the future,
such e confliet as is naw drawing ta a close
in Europe. Naturally, in comman with all
othar members ai this Hause and, I hope,
with every Canadien, I amn dahighted ta know
that the United-Nations are about ta hold a
meeting devoted ta furthering international
gaod will and prerventing war, and that this
meeting ai the United Nations is going
ta take place in the very near future. I
arn happy ta state ta the honourebla leader,

whao la a ininister of the Government, that

way possible. At the same time friendly
relations with our neighbour to the south and
our other gallant allies must be maintained.
I do not want to touch on post-war trade,
but if you will allow me only a word or two
I should like to say that export trade will no
longer be done "cash on the barrelhead" as it
formerly was, 'but rather by exchange of
goodsSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -and I hope
that whatever Government is in power during
the post-war period it will use every endeavour
to favour the Mother Country who, in 1940,
saved not only herself but Canada, the whole
British Empire, and all the freedom-loving
democracies who have suffered untold losses
Even now, day after day, poor unfortunate
women and children are being killed by the
robot bomb in England. Therefore, it is
only right that we and the other self-governing
Dominions, and the Empire as a whole should
do everything we can to assist the Mother
Country as a slight token of our appreciation
for the magnificent sacrifices she has made. I
-am proud to be a CanadianSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am proud to
be a British subject.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am one of
those who firmly believe that the success of
Canada in the past and in the future-free and
independent nation as we are-is due to the
fact that we are part and parcel of that vast
Empire on which the sun never sets.
My good friend to my left in his very
eloquent and interesting speech of yesterday
congratulated the armed forces of Canada.
At this time I should like to add my tribute.
Canada has played a very important role in
the war-on the sea, on land and in the air.
To those wbo are fighting so gallantly for us
on foreign fields I want to say how proud
we are of them, and assure them that when
they return nothing we can give wi-ll be too
good for them. I should like to extend my
remarks a little further and include the women
in the services. I also want to thank the
nurses, the Red Cross, and all those who have
helped in the munitions factories, and who
have laboured in the mines and forests.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: And the mercantile
marine.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The mercantile
marine is included in the services I mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is taken for granted.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There has been
a great combination of loyal Canadian effort
from one end of the country to the other,
and the representatives of Canada will go
to the San Francisco Conference with their
heads held high.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Canada has
every right to be proud of her magnificent
record in this war, and proud also of the
privileged place she holds as the senior
Dominion within the British Commonwealth
of Nations. What our Prime Minister and
the delegates who accompany him will say
and do at the San Francisco Conference will
carry a great deal of weight.
Before I sit down let me say once more,
Mr. Leader, that we wholeheartedly endorse
the resolution. We wish you and your associates every success at the conference. God
bless you!
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators,
I think I am right in saying that probably never has a more important matter come
before this Chamber than the one referred to
in this resolution. The fact that Canada has
received an invitation from the great republic
to the south to attend the San Francisco Conference shows conclusively to my mind that
Canada is taking her place in world affairs.
That the United States and Canada have lived
alongside each other in amity for upwards of a
century is an outstanding example to the world
of how peace can be maintained when the.relations of nations are based on good will.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not object to what
my honourable friend the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. King) and my honourable
friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) have said about what might or should
be done at the San Fraicisco Conference;
on the contrary, I commend them for their
splendid speeches; but I say let us pass this
resolution, let us send our delegates to San
Francisco in order that they may learn the
views of the great nations there represented,
and then state the views of Canada. Let
our delegates never forget that, while Canada
is proud of her position as the senior
Dominion of the British Commonwealth, she
is mistress in her own home. Both the
British Empire and the United States recognize her status and realize that in future
Canada's views must be considered in matters
of peace and war.
Although forty-four nations are to be represented at the conference, Russia, Great
Britain and the United States will, as the

SENATE
honourable leader opposite bas said, be the
dominant powers. And wby should they not
be? They in the last five years have borne
the heat and burden of the war. But Canada
also has played a noble and impressive part
in the struggle. This is recognized by Great
Britain, the United States and Russia, and
is, I venture to say, the reason why Canada
is invited to send representatives to this conference of the United Nations.
We can do nothing more to-day than pass
this resolution and wish our delegates God
speed. We must give them full discretion to
express their views in reply to the views
advanced by the representatives cf the other
powers with respect to certain principles
wh ich no doubt will be presented for discussien. When our delegates submit their report
the Parliament of Canada must decide how
f-r this country is to participate in the setting up of an organization to ensure, as far
as bumanly possible, the outlawing of war
and the prescrvation of peace throughout the
world. Se I say. let us wish our delegates
God speed. Surely the world has already been
to muiich tormented by war, and any action
which will put a stop te future aggression is
certain of a hearty reception. particularly Py
fle paee-lo-ving people of tlis great Dominion. I am not much worried whether one
country or anotler may objeet to some of
the, proposais to lbe discussed at the San
Francisco Conference. Ther can be little
doibt tîat after this trcmendous expenditure
of encrgy, money and blood, and the appalling havoc of the last five years, no representative of any of the great powers will
dare stand up in that conference and declare: "We will net agree to the settlement
of international disputes by arbitration." I
am confident that I voice the sentiments of
ouir people when I say that they need have
no fear as to the part Canada will play in
this conference in hclping te assure the future
peace and security of the world.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
in rising to say a few words on this resolution,
I île so without any ida that I can contribute
anything new to the discussion, since the ground
has been pretty well covered in the debates in
the two Houses of Parliament. I rise rather
as one of the two representatives of Canadian
women in this Chamber to empbasize the great
interest which the women of Canada bave in
this coming conference, because if there is anyone who is deeply interested in the abolition
of war and the preservation of peace it is the
Canadian wife or mother who has known the
agony of the past few vears.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
Mon. Mr. DUFF.

Hear, Pear.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: The sufferings endured
and the sacrifices made by so many of our
women Pave burned deeply into the bearts of
all Canadian women, until to-day they say
with one voice: "Let there be no more war!"
Epecially is this truc of the younger women
of our country, who naturally are longing for
an era of peace and security in which they can
establish homes and bring up families without
any lurking fear or dim foreboding of what
the future may hold for their children. Se
while the women of Canada have donc everytlhing in their power to help win this war, and
while no one will rejoice more fervently than
they when the last shot is fired, they are
even
xnow
looking beyond that great day of
victory, wondering wliether it will bring to
them an assurance of international peace and
securitv in the future.
I think I can speak for a great many Canadians when I sa' in connection with this conference that what they most earnestly hope
for is some guarantue for future peace, something more than nacre lip service.
lon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear. bear.

lion. Mrs. FALLIS:
We have had too
muhieli hp service to the cause of peace and
secuîrity in this world, and not enough action
to bring it about.
Soen

Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: It is perhaps bueause
of the latter situation that some of us perused
with a little misgiving the address of the
Prime Minister when lie presented this re-oltion to the other House. That point lias been
touched on )y the bonourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). I find myself
heartily in accord with his views and with wlat
the Honourable Minister of Mines and Resources said in another place, because after al]
we are looking to ouir Canadian delegation to
give leadership. We recognize with pride that
outside of what we commonly call the Great
Powers, Canada stands head and shoulders
above most if not all of what we usually
designate as the secondary powers, in at least
three outstanding respects: first, the contribution s'ie has made to winning the war;
second, the contribution she can make te the
preservation of peace; third, the influence she
can exert both upon Great Britain and upon
the United States. It is because of the unique
place which Canada occupies in this regard
that her attitude at the conference will bc
watced with the greatest interest by the
secondary powers and the example which she
sets will, I think, have great and far-reaching
in fluence.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear,

MAiRCH 28, 1045

lon. Mrs. FALLIS: If there is any one
tbing on wbich we Canadians are in agreement,
1 believe it is this, that fia other nation in the
world more sincerely desires ta avoid anotber
war. Then, it seems ta me, it is only simple
and intelligent reasoning ta assume that the
mare anxious we are ta avoid another war, the
more whoiebeartediy we will support any
decision taken at the canference, any machin-

ery whicb may be set up, aniy instrument
which may be fashioned, which wili be effective as a means of preventing wars in tbe
future.
We bave beard it stated several times to-day,
and we ail know it is true, tbat the prime
condition upon which world peace and security
will he founded is the continued solidarity of

the Big Three. Withaut that foundation we
know there wiil be fia peace and security for
the world in tbe days ta came. But, I submait,
it is also necessary now ta bring as quickly as
we can a measure of hope and present security
ta the liberated areas of devastated, Europe.
That cannot be done uniess the people are
first fed and clotbed and housed. I realize,
honourable senatars, tbat since tbis does not
came within tbe scope of tbe motion before us
I mray be slightiy out of order, but I would
ask the indulgence of the Bouse because it
is somnetbing that is very much upon my mind
at the present time. We read in tbe papers
statements like that made tbe other day by

the Archbishop of Canterbury about conditions in Northern Bolland, tbat ahl tbe borrors of war tbrough wbich tbe people of that
country had passed were as notbing compared
ta the horrors of slow deatb from starvatian
which they are gaing tbrough at the present
time. I feit on reading that and similar
statements that if tbey make tbe impact upon
us tbat they sbould, if we have not already
become hardened by war's brutality and suifering, it is a time for tbe searching of aur
national conscience ta ascertain wbetber we
are daing everytbing witbin aur power ta belp
tbe peoples in those war-ravaged cauntries.
I know tbat this matter is under consideration by the Government. We ail know that
the extent ta whicb we can belp by sending
supplies is governed iargely by the sbipping
space available; but from day ta day there
bave been rather disquieting items in tbe
press saying that the Government hesitates ta

impose food rationing because it migbt be
unpopular, or words ta that effeet. That is not
officiai, but just common report.

0f course, we ail know that in every community

there

are some selfisb

people wbo

abject ta self-denial, but I think Il speak for
the great majority of Canadian womnen when I
say that if the matter were properly explained

27

they would be flot only willing but glad, ta
have the strictest kind of food rationing
imposed in this country, if therby we could
send more belp than we are now sending ta
the people of those devastated areas. Honestly, when 1 read in the papers of individuals in England setting apart a portion
of their scanty daiiy rations and sending it in
parcels ta the people of Holland and other
countries where starvation is rife, I arn almost
ashamed ta look at the tables ta which we sit
down in Canada. On behaif of the women,
whom I represent in this Bouse, I should like
to repeat that I arn sure they would be only
too glad ta have the strictest kind of food
rationing imposed uapon them if that would
hip ta alleviate the sufferings of people in
lands that have been overrun by the enemy.
1 corne back ta the resolution before us.
Honourable senators wiil recall that after the
Prime Minister made bis speech in moving
the resolution in another place there was a
good deal of comment on bis failure to make
more than a *slight passing reforence ta
Canada's relations ýta the other members of
the Commonwealth. The honourable leader
of the Governrnent in this House (Hon. Mr.
King) bas replicd, ta that comment ta-day and
quoted very reassuring statements, which we
accept unreservediy. At the same time we
bave only ta cast aur thougbts back over the
debates of the iast week or so in another
place ta realize that if one ventures ta suggest
the sincere opinion that Canada can best fuifil
ber destiny by working -in clasest co-operation
with Great Britain and. the ýother members of
the Commonwealth, one runs a decidecd risk
of bcing lectured for baving Tory Imperialistie
tendencies or accused of wishing ta see Canada
rcturn ta ber "colonial status". I believe that
was a strong po>int in one speech made in
another place.
I always think that people who talk of
Canada going back to ber "colonial status"
must be suffering from an inferiority complex,
be 'cause tbey base their argument upon conditions which no longer exist, except in the
realm of their awn imagination. Sureiy any
discussion whicb takes place on this matter
to-day should be founded upon facts and conditions of to-day ratheT 'than upon those of
two or three decades aga. I was much interested the other day ta see how one writer
expresscd bis opinian on this. Ile said:
Just as the War of Independence between
Great Britain and the United States left its
mark upon the United States ta sncb a degree
that many people there still do their thinking
lu the mental surroundings of nearly two
centuries ago, sa here in Can-ada mlich of the
discussion and argument is la att-'mpting ta

pravide against the dangers which disappeared
years ago.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: That is the way 1
understand it. Let me go further and ask the
hoDnourabie leader of the Government if 1
interpret clause 3 of the resolution correctiy.
Thiat clause states:
Tiat this House approves the purposes and
prineipies set forth in the proposais of the fourGovernments, and considers that these proposais
constitute a s atisfactory general basis for a
discussion of the charter of the proposed international organization.
As to the proposai that no one of the fiv.e
great powers couid be discipiined uniess the
five were unanimous, 1 should like to asic the
honourabie leader if hie understands that this
i)roposal can be discussed and changed at the
conference?
Hon. Mr. KING: I shouid think so.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I arn very giad to hear
that, breause it bias been giving me some
concern.
I do not think it is any great secret, bonourable senators, that rnany people of thjs country
have been deepiy trou'bied over the Polish
settiement. 1 freeiy admit that perbaps the
deal was the best that couid be made; neyertheiess I repeat that it bias been the subjeet
of anxious consideration on the part of many
Canadians.
There is another point whicb I shouid like
to raise. Is it proposed that the economie
and financial set-up of the various govern-

moents wiil be discussed at the conference?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, I think so.
lIon. Mr. DAVIES: Some six weeks or two
months ago I attended a smail dinner at
which were prescrnt two prominent Canadian
economists. Wbile 1 do flot understand ail
the ramifications of tbe statistics on wbich
they based their conclusions, I recail that one
of them said it was probable that after the war
is over there wiil be set up a sterling blockof which Great Britain wili be the bead, and
that Canada may not be incided in it. The
speaker-one of our most noted economistswent on to say that if this country was not
inciuded in that sterling block the people of
Canada would have te, become reconciled to
continued taxation at the present high rates.
because it would be necessary cither to subsidize the three Prairie provinces or to
liquidate them and move their people to other
parts of the country. That statement was
made in the presence of some twenty-four
persons of more or less prominence. I arn very
giad to hear fromn the honourabie leader that
financial matters will be discussed at the con.ference, for I arn sure that if this is donc the
Canadian delegation will look weii after thc
interests of this country.

29

Hon. Mr. KING: I do not wan't to be
misunderstood. The function of the confer-

ence is to set up machinery whereby these
matters cau be considered within the Assembly
after the organization is established.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: It is possible that they
may be discussed, I hope they are, because
I must confess that wben I bear Canadian
economists talk about iiquidating the three
Prairie Provinces it becomes a very serious
matter. This man was very serious when hie
was discussing it.
Before I sit down 1 want te moin with the
honourabie senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Failis) in bier tribute to those countries
ivhich have suffered during the war, and I want
te pay particular trihute to the people of
Great Britain. 1 happened to spend a month
in Great Britain during the latter part of
November and tbe beginning of December,
and I must ronfess that I was aimost asbamed
of'myself. I came back and said that everynne
over there sbould bave a medai pinned on him.
One night I was invited to sit down to supper
in a splendid borne, a beautiful home where
at one time they had bad three servants but
now bave none. Ail the beat tbey bad carne
from a littie bit of fire in the kitchen. This
was Friday nigbt and tbey were having sansages for supper. They were deiigbted because
they were geing to have a iamb chop each on
Sunday. That struck home te me. Their
meat aiiowance was one sbilling-twopence per
week, that is ail, but there was no grumbling
and ne grousing. 1 found them carrying on
and taking everything as a matter of course.

Tbeir fuel was rationed, and they were sit-

ting around littie bits of fires, ail wrapped up
in sweaters and rugs, but they were not coinpiaining in any manner, shape or form.
I shouid like te, pay my tribute to the
people of Great Britain during this discussion,
not oniy for what they bave donc in providing
men and munitions, but for the way in wbieh

tbey have contributed to the success of the
war on tbe home front.

Befere sitting down I want to join with the
speakers who bave preceded me in wishing the
deiegates to tbe San Francisco conference
evcry success. Whoever they are, I arn sure

they will represent Canada nobiy and welIi and
we shail all be satiafied.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Hugessen the
debate was adjourned.

go with advances in the basic principles of
government. It seems to me the reason for
this lies in the fact that our parliamentary
system always has been able to meet the needs
of the day, even if sometimes in a groping and
dilatory fashion. The need of constantly cultivating our British type of democracy cannot
be over-emphasized.
Compared with ancient
forms of government, our parliamentary institutions are relatively young, and it might be
ventured as a truism that people do not yet
know how to appreciate freedom. The totalitarian forms of government such as Italian
Fascism, German Nazism and Russian Socialism,
all are reactions from democracy to the ancient
autocracies. So it is, I say, that there is a
real need of consciously and continuously cultivating our democratic institutions, of trying
to improve and better then, if they are to
survive, and if freedom as we know it is not
to perish.
We are now living in a time of great changes
-- changes brought about by war, by science, and
by vast increases in man's ability to produce
wealth. It is about some of the things which
the Senate, as one of the two federal Houses
of Parliament, does and can do to meet the
special needs of our day that I propose to
speak to-night.
First, however, let me say a word about the
Parliament of Canada and the place in our
system of government which is occupied by the
Senate. I have said that we follow the pattern
of the British governmental structure. There,
Parliament consists of the King, the Lords and
the Commons. Here it is the King, the Senate
and the Commons. You all know that members
of the House of Commons, sometimes called
the Lower House, are elected, while the Senate
consists of men and women appointed by the
Crown. The House of Commons is constituted
on the principle of representation according to
population; and so it is that, out of today's
membership of 245 in that Chamber, 147-more
than one-half---come from the Provinces of
Ontario and Quebec. The Senate is constituted
on the principle of representation according to
territorial divisions. For this purpose, at the
time of Confederation, Canada was regarded as
consisting of three separate areas, Upper Canada
(Ontario), Lower Canada (Quebec), and the
Maritime Provinces. British Columbia and the
other Western Provinces subsequently were
constituted a fourth territorial division and
given equal representation with the other three.
Accordingly, our full Senate now consists of
96 members, with 24 being nominated from and
representing, respectively, the Western Provinces, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes. If
time permitted, it might be useful to make
some detailed review of the historical background and the reasons for the differences in
the constitution of our two Houses of Parliament and the reason that the House of
Commons, on the one hand, is elective, and the
Senate, on the other hand, is nominative. However, as I prefer to address myself particularly
to the present-day function and purpose of the
Senate, I will be content with one or two brief
observations regarding the reasons which
prompted the Fathers of Confederation to lay
out the pattern of our national parliament as
they did. I think that I can best do this by
stating two simple propositions and then making
a few comments on each.
The first is that if there had not been provision for a Senate or "Upper House," as it
sometimes is called, there could have been no
Confederation and no Dominion of Canada as

31

we know it to-day. The importance attached to
the constitution of the Senate by the Fathers
of Confederation can be gathered from the fact
that practically the whole of six days out of a
total of fourteen spent by them in discussing
the details of the Confederation Pact, were
devoted to this branch of our parliament. A
perusal of the Confederation Debates of 1865
makes it clear that the Maritime Provinces and
Quebec declined to enter the scheme of union
unless there was a Senate. They anticipated
the situation which, in fact, obtains today,
where only two of the regions of Canada, on
the basis of population, could control the
deliberations of the House of Commons. As was
said at the time by Sir John A. Macdonald:
. . . . In order to protect local interests and
prevent sectional jealousies it was found
requisite that the three great divisions into
which British North America is separated,
should be represented in the Upper House on
the principle of equality."
The provinces, and especially those which I
have mentioned, in joining a union in which
they were to surrender a large measure of their
independence, wanted to be sure that a parliamentary majority, supported in some sections
of Canada but perhaps not in others, could not
legislate against their interests, local or racial,
without the balance-wheel of *a second chamber; a sort of court of review in which the
respective territorial regions of the country
were to be equally represented and which would
be less dependent on the passing fancies of the
electors than the House of Commons. Thus, in
the same speech to which I have already
referred,, Sir John A. refers to the Senate as
"the sober second thought in legislation." There
is an important piece of evidence that the sentiment as expressed by Quebec and the Maritimes
then bas not changed since 1867. As recently as
1927 a Dominion-Provincial conference was
asked to consider the subject of abolition or
reform of the Senate. The provinces were
unanimously opposed to abolition and there was
no suggestion for reform cf sufficient merit to
warrant a conclusion of the assembly.
I have said that without provision for a
Senate there could have been no Confederation.
The second proposition which I would now
state is that, without a Senate, even now it is
doubtful if Confederation could long endure.
While my first submission is easily established from the records of the past, my second
may not be so obvious. It rests on the convietion that the need to safeguard the minority
and sectional rights and interests of Canada is
as great today as ever it was. In recent years,
we have seen new parties spring up-often on a
local or provincial basis. To-day there is one
party whieh dominates in Alberta and enjoys
little support anywhere else. There is another
that is now powerful in Saskatchewan with
linited support elsewhere. There are at least
three parties in Quebec contending for support
which have no backing in the other provinces.
The possibility of a House of Commons dominated by a party or combination of parties
composed of members from only two of the four
great regions of Canada cannot be dismissed.
Absence of the guarantee of "sober secondthought" for legislation by a body conscious of
the interests of all parts of the country would
give rise to anxiety and, possibly, in time,
would result in a demand for separation. Even
without any unusual party situation such as I
have stipulated, in these days when legislation

SENATE

se often touches the personal rights and interests
of the people, the demands we hear put forward
on sectional grounds from tirne to time would
assume more weight and might constitute a
much greater menace were there not the Upper
House.
With this brief and wholly inadequate
explanation of the reasons founding the creation
of the Senate and some of those bearing upon
the need for its continruance as an integral part
of our parlianentary system, perhaps I might
pass to serne observations as to how the Senate
does its work. To-day you will find aongst
its membership many men with long experience
in Parli-ament and a good number who have
served in federal and provincial cabinets.
Others have been leaders in various fields in
private life-labour, farming. business and the
professions, including the army. I can assert
with confidence that to-d,ay«s Senate mrembership constitutes a very real representation of the
racial
and economie
occupational,
various
characteristies of the Cantadian people. Occasiorally one hears the Senate re ferr er to as an
asseiblage of "old fogies" or "the haven et
worn-out politicians". Lot me state that suih
a conception of the mrembership of the Upper
Hiorse could not be further froi the truti. As
a young man and one who does not regard himself either as 'an old fogie" or a "worn-orit
piolitician," tire first impression which I received
on entering the Senate wvas the high standard of
experiece and business and political intelligence of tie men with ewhom I found myselif
associated. Of course, there are some Senators
wio are in the evening of life. All of themn
are older than I, but, speaking as J now am to
an assembly of persons born mostly in the twentieth century. I think tha.t you will agree witi
me that without the wisdom whiclr comes of long
ycars of experience, leadership in Canadian governrment might 'be expected to follow a raither
uncertain and perilous course. In times of stress
and of national emergency, J will take, any day,
tei
legislative sagacity of the wrinkled and
white-thaitohed brow in preference te the inexperienced and sometimes reckless self-assurance of youth. Certainly, let us have more
younger men in government, but let us also
retain tire tempering influence of the elder
statesmen.
Notwithstanding that the Senate bas vested
in it co-extensive authority with the House of
Comnons regarding the initiation of legislation
-excepting
any bill resulting in a tax-most
Acts cf Parliament start in -the Lower House
and get second treatment in tire Senate. For
this reason, our Chamber frequently has nothing
before h iii the early stages of the session and
is obliged to take many adjournments. In the
later stages it puts in a great deal of intensive
work. both in full session and in committees,
considering and revising a rush of legislation
from the Lower House. Unhappily, the publie
is not really alive to the very considerable
volume of wo.rk which is done by the Senate.
Unlike the House of Commons, very few bills
are considered in Gommittee of the Whole
House but are referred to one or other of the
special standing committees for consideration.
This committee work is of a higily prosaic
nature and does not furnish much meat for the
gentlemen of the press. Consequently, it does
not get into print. In the result, the Sen.ate
g te little or no credit from the Canadian people
for the long hours of drudgery which its members undertake in hearing evidence and in re-

viewing and recommending amendments with
regard to bills which come before the committees. For instance, very few people know that
during the session of Parliament which was atjourned last August the Seuate effected amendments to some fourteen bills coming from the
House of Commons. Some of these changes were
important; others less so, but it is clear, even
f.rom this recent experience that there is need
in our parliamentary system for a body of
review and revision. How man-y Canadians are
aware of the fact that the Senate in the past
has effected numerous and substantial savings
to the taxpayers of this country by rejecting
legislation whieh originated in the Lower
House?
In this connection, not long ago, I
found an interesting statement by the late Senator Charles Murphy, made in the course of a
debate referring to the work of the Senate. It
was not by any means an exhaustive review of
the record of the Upper House, but, by mention
of oily somie ton bills which had been rrjected or
amended by the Senate, having to do with the
wnorks, the
appropriation of moineys for plbli
construction of railways and similar undertakings, lie was able to show that the taxpayers of
Canada had been saved in excess cf one hundred
million dollars. There are people in this country
whîro to-day complain that an annual expenditure
of sorme five hundred and fifty thousand dollars
required to maintain the Senate is not justified.
If a comparable proposai were made to save
the expense of maintaining our courts of justice,
it coukl expect to receive no public support. Yet,
rn reviewing and revising federal legislation at
its source, the work of tire Senate in protecting
the rights and libeirties of our people can be
regarded to be equally as important as tie funetion of administering the criminal and civil law
of tie land.
The wide experience of the senators of which
J have spoken and their ability to take a
detached view results in many improvements
in the detail of the legislation as well as,
occasionally, sore important changes in principle.
Many members of the Senate, myself
included, would like to sec more legislation
introduced in the Upper House so that there
would be a better balance of work between the
two houses with a consequent possible shortening
of the very lengthy sessions which recently have
been the rule. For varions reasons, however,
governments seen to prefer to get the bills
through the House of Commons first and, as I
have said, this net infrequently resuits in
leaving the Senate with nothing to do. Especially in time of war, the responsibility for
formiulating legislative policy must rest almost
exclusively with the executive, that is, tbe

exception (and he without portfolio) have their
sente in the House of Commons. it is natural
that the situation which J have just mentioned
is aggravated under existing conditions.
Now, even apart from the fact that Bills
usually go to the Commons first and often move
slowly to the Senate, it is to be expected that
the Upper House will not spend as much time

te do a whole lot more talking than 96. The
members of the Commons, moreover, represent
the people directly and they are charged by
their constituents with the special responsibility
of airing their complaints and suggestions.

MARCH 28, 1045
Long silence on the part of a member of the
House of Commons, or refusal to champion a
cause close to the hearts of his electQis, may be
fatal to his future aspirations. As an indication of what I have in mind in this respect,
let me refer to the debate on the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne and the
debate on the budget, which are two major
discussions taking place in the normal session.
At these times, members may discuss almost
any subject under the sun. In the Commons
these debates often take many weeks. In the
Senate, they ordinarily occupy only a few days.
As I have said, speeches in the Commons, to a
large extent-and very properly so-are made
for the purpose of expressing what members
conceive to be the views and wishes of the
particular constituencies which have sent them
to Ottawa.
During the past session, for
instance, there was a very lengthy debate
relating to the controlled price of strawberries
in British Columbia, and another warm discussion regarding the policy of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board respecting the collection and distribution of empty beer bottles in
Nova Scotia. The War Appropriation Bill of
this Session was under consideration by the
House of Commons for more than four months
and it required 1,833 pages of the printed
House of commons Hansard to report the members' speeches; but when the Bill left the Lower
House not a single dollar of change had been
affected in -any departmental appropriation
proposed by the Government.
J have purposely mentioned these debating
practices in the House of Commons, not because
i am out of agreement with them-on the contrary. I believe them to be essential to our
democratic system-but chiefly because the
Senate occasionally is criticized on the ground
that it does not sit as many days or do as
much speech-making as the other louse. Such
criticism, like a good deal on other grounds,
ignores the Senate's real function, which is
essentially different from that of the House of
Commons. As once was said by a former leading member of our Chamber "the Senate should
be a workshop and not a theatre."
In referring rather summarily to some of the
charges levelled at the Senate. I have no desire
to dismiss the question of reform. For instance,
I have heard suggestions that the Senate should
be elective or that appointments to that Chamber should be made on the recommendation of
provincial governments or the provincial legislatures. With regard to the suggestion for
election of Senators, J might point out in passing that this proposal was very carefully considered by the Fathers of Confederation, who
xejected the idea after having had some considerable experience with an elective second
chamber in the old Province of Upper Canada.
Whatever may be one's individual views regarding proposals for reform, constructive suggestions are both practical and legitimate subjects
for discussion in a democracy which wishes to
keep its institutions alive and in tune with the
times.
There is no true democracy, however, in the
talk of a politician who undertakes to abolish
the Senate if, on achieving power in the Commons, he finds the Upper House will not do
his bidding. To abolish the Senate is to make
a fundamental change in the political structure
of the federated provinces of this Dominion.
We have only to recall the demands of the
Confederation conference for the institution of
the Senate and of the Dominion-Provincial con-

33

ference of 1927 for its continuance, to realize
that its abolition would remove the safeguards
which it was intended to provide. Politicians
who glhbly talk of abolishing or changing the
Senate in some arbitrary or summary fashion
are proposing a course of action which would
destroy one of the main pillars of our federal
state. Irresponsible declarations of the kind
I have just mentioned spring from an attitude
of distrust of the Senate entertained by some
people who have what might be called advanced
or radical views. This distrust has its root in
the belief that, in a given set of circumstances,
the Senate might stand as a last bulwark and
instrument of the vested interests; that it might
attempt to stifle reforms demanded by a
majority of the people. My submission is that
those who would like to see the Senate act in
that fashion are doomed to disappointment.
Genuine reformers who carry the considered
support of a majority of the people have
nothing to fear from the Senate.
It is certainly possible for a bill to pass the
House of Commons and be rejected by the
Senate. Therefore, it is possible for a radical
party, after winning an election, to propose a
measure which might meet defeat in the Senate.
It is well that this is so because elections usually
are not won on single issues; and because one
party might win an election, it would not
necessarily follow, for instance, that the people
would want to nationalize all financial institutions. They might merely have preferred Mr.
Coldwell's fine head of hair to Mr. King's sparse
gray locks and Mr. Bracken's photogenic smile.
Earlier I used the words--"second-thought".
That was not to say that the Senate merely is a
place where legislators give things a second
thought but rather, on important issues to
say that the Senate is a means of giving the
people a chance to think twice. The Senate
would be entirely justified in rejecting a government bill of major importance involv'ing a vital
government policy if, in its view, the bill was
unsound or unjustly affected the rights of individuals or groups of individuals. The Government could then, and undoubtedly would, at the
first opportunity, hold an election in which that
particular bill would be the issue. If it were
returned to office on that issue and should
re-enact the bill, the Senate, while still legally
entitled to reject it again would, in point of
fact (at least in my opinion) have no choice
but to pass it. Unsound and dangerous political
doctrines must be fought by argument among
the people. They cannot be checked in the
Upper House. The Senate may give the people
a chance to think twice but it cannot be
expected to do more.
I have been a member of the Senate for only
two sessions, but, even during that limited time,
I have had an opportunity to appraise the great
service which that branch of Parliamsnt renders
in the legislative process of Government. However. in addition to .its established functions,
which, I say, it discharges thoroughly and well,
T venture the belief that the Senate might be
made of greater use in solving some of the
special difficulties of our age. If I were asked
my opinion as to what is the greatest general
problem of government at the present time, I
might state it as being the adjustment of parliamentary democracy to the employment of
experts. Ma.ny people rage about bureaucrats,
but we get more and more of them! An eminent
English jurist a short time ago warned against

MÂ-RCH 28, 1945
ihere are also other subjects which are ripe
for investigation by impartial but responsible
committees of Parliament. Without attempting
to be exhaustive 1~ could mention several topics
in respect of which committees of the Senate
might undertake investigations for the piqrpose
of giving opportunity for dirlect public representations with a view to the formulation of
recommendations of policy for the assistance of
tbe Government and Parliamient.
One of the questions which one freqîiently
i-cars discussed to-day is that of post-war immigration. This is a very live question. but.
under the stress and strain of working out our
imreediate wartime problems, it yet remains to
be given any consideration by Parliament. In
the Senats, we have a standing Committee on
Immigration .and Labour. 1 submit that a very
useful purpose would be servod if there were
imposed uipon this or some other sp"ýcial coinmittes of the Senate the duty of inquiring into
our immigration laws and making reCoannendations concerning the future policy of Canada
withi regard to them.
The revision and modernization of our election
laws is another problem which requires study.
Tt le true that the Senate is not the elective
brancb of Parliament but, surely, much good
could be done and much progress made by an
open and impartial investigation by a Senate
committee of ithe federal siection machinery.
Time after time. one bears suggestions that we
should have in this country an electoral systsm
incorporating the use of the single transferable
ballot. Only a short time ago another suggestion
was nmade to me proposing the perpetuation of
our system of National Registration for the
purpose of providing a current, up-to-date register of persons entitled to vote in each electoral
district. If this could be dons, it migbt avoid
the heavy expense of frequent enumerations and
compilations of vot-ers' lists and, at the saine
time, preserve for maay other purposes the
advantages of this standing census of our aduit
population. These suggestions come f rom the
roots of our national thinking, but there is no
parliamentary forum in which they caa be given
free expression. Coasequsntly, nothiag is dons
about them and there develops a stagnation
which could be avoided.
There is still another matter whicb, I venture
to suggest, miglit usefully be made the subjeet
of inquiry and study by a committes of the
Senate. It i5 oas wbich, 1 fear, would necessarily be very extensive and protracted as to
the time involved. I refer to the suggestion frequently made for an intelligent inquîry into and
review of the machinery and administration of
the Income War Tax Act and, if we are to
keep it on our statuts books, the Excese Profits
Tax Act. The Income War Tax Act was first
enacted in 1917. At that time, it was regardsd
as emergency legielation and was designed to
subsist only for the then war period. Siace
then. like Topsy, it bas just "growed." There
bas neyer been any full review or revision of
the Act, but ia almost every session since 1917,
it bas been patched and added to until, to-day,
it is one of the most complex and diffienît of
interpretation and application of any of our
laws. In a recent issue of the Canadian Bar
Review is a reprint of an address delivered
32280--3j

before tbe last convention of the Canadian Bar
Association relatiag to, the confusion and uncertainties arising from the administration of these
two Acts as they are now framed. As an
example of wbat the speaker there had in mind,
hie told bis audience that in the Iacome War
Tax and Excess Profits Tax Acts, tbe Miaister
of National Revenue, in one form or another, is
vested one hundred times witb a discretioaary
autbority to determine tbe rights and liabilitieof the taxpayer. I need not go into all of theobjections wbicb can be raised to the mechanicsw
of income tax assessmsat and collection as
provided under these two statutes, but to,
indicate that tbere is a demand for the kind.
of inquiry I am suggesting, permit me to quote
briefiy f romn the address of the learaed Kiag's
Counsel who addressed himself to the Canadiain
Bar Association on this important subjeot. He
says: ". . . The Act should be re-framed at the
earliest opportunity to eliminate sucli discretionary autbority, except, of course, in respect of
forma and minor administrative matters. The
provisions of the Act sbould be based upon
accepted priaciples of income tax law. The
righits of the taxpayer sbould be protected by an
independeat Board of Tax Cominissioners or
Tribunal standing btween -the Crown and the
taxpayer. This Board or Tribunal should hear
appeals from tbe assessmente of the administrative officiais rather tban baving the appeal go,
in the first instance, to the Minister (as it aow
does) wbicb means that the officiais who prepared the assessment pass upon the appeal".
I trust that you will not interpret the suggestions wbich 1 bave been making as iadioating
a view on my part that our syetem of representative government is f alliag into decay and is
not measuring up to its job. On the contrary,
I bave waated to impres you witb the f act
that the great 'advantage of our preseat system
of parliamentary demnocracy is tbat -it works.
Tbe proposais to wbich I bave ventured to give
uttenance are designed to the end only that the
systemn be utilized to fuller measure in the
national intereat. Our two Houss of Parliamient pulliag together, the ons complementing
the work of the other, uadoubtedly oan salve
the futuxe problenis of this vigorous and promisiag country of wbich we are citizena.
Just before 1 close, let me tell pou of an
instance which took place during the last session
in which the Houe of Commons -and the Senate
did. complement; the work of ecd other. Ths
Houe of Commoas passed a bill dealiag with
taking the votes of service personnel at general
elections. Prohably intent on the main purpose, tbey overlooked a clause wbich would bave
struck at oas of the foundations of our democratic system-that of universal suffrage. It
migbt bave disfrancbised a great aumber of
Canadian citizens merely because tbey are
desceaded f romn the races witb wbicb we are
aow at war. The point was noticed in the
Senate wbere tbe bill was amended and sent
back ta, the Houe of Commons. Ia the meantume, public opinion was aroueed tbrough the
discussions wbich took place in the Upper
Chamber and in the press. The Houe of
Commone, dealiag wtih the bill again, produced
a stili more liberal and satisfactory amendment
than the ons wbich the Senate had adopted.

1In our goverinental plan. the Senate and
th e 1-b use oif Coinous are flie workiiig parts.
1n the latter wc have expressed that principle
of dleiocracy whieh holds that the xvili of the
majority shouid govern. Tfhe former represents
that other ertually important principle of
democracy that the viii ef flie inajority shail
be governed by cousiderations of justice. As
has been said by Rt. Hlon. Arthur -Meighen, a
fermer senator and oee Unie Prime inister of
Canada, the principal function of the Senate
"is te see that those great principies upon whielh
the Dominion has reposed are carefuily relccted
in its statutes, te design legisiation se as to
meet the realities of business. to review and
teînper proposais of the other House so as not
uiinecessarily te discourage enterprise or restrict
tares of empinyment; to oppose the ravages
of partisanship froin whatever source they corne,
and at ieast te give public opinion time sud
opportunity to be deliberate sud to be understocd; to be governed flot se ranch hy einotional
appeal or fieeting spasms of popular f an'-y but
te listen te the accountant, the operater, the
employer, the employee and tie unempioyed and
to make sure that legislation when finaliy passed
wili wxerk with fairness and facility. . . . For
this function the Senate was crea.ted, and this
function it rnust with tboroughness and fearlessness perform."

CAPITULATION-PRESS
REPORT

QUESTION

0F PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KIN-G: Before the Orders ef thse
Day are called I should like, on a question of
prix ilege, te inake a statement. 1 notice in
the Ottawa Evening Journal of Wednesday,
Mýarch 28, 1 arn reolrted as saying:
Capitulatio~n in Few Days, says Dr. King.
Dr. J. H. King, gox-ernment Senate leader,
said last nigbt iu the Senate tbat war deveiopments miglit resuit in German capitulation
'within a few days."
I xvould net have called attention te the
report had it net been foliowed by this comment in this morning's Journal:
Tise Government leader iii the Senate, Dr.
King, suggests Gerunany may capitulate "withiu
a few days". Our generals are net nearly se,
optimistic-or at ieast net nearly se eutspeken.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, eh.
Hon. '.\r. KING: I have really ne ceinpli int regardiug the press report, but I have
tîîken the precaution of checking what I did
say as if xvas recorded by the officiai reporters of thiis Cliamber. In view of the comment
I have just cited sud of other comment I
have heard in various quarters, 1 do net
desire te he placed in the ridiculeus position
of eue who, without intimate knowledge of
xvliat is happening on the wvestern fr-ont, huis
the tenierity te state that the xvar will end
1witliu a few days.'
I arn quite prepared te
hav e my' statement published, for 1 think it
bears indication of ýhaving been made with
seme' care and thought. I said:
Tflec successful iandiug of our treops in Nermnamiy, follewed by the iightning drive acros
lFiance, encournged hope net oniy iii this country
but arneng ahl the aiiied nations that Germany
weuld be ferccd te give up the atruggle sorne
tisne iu the ýautumu. Uuhappily that hope was
net reaiized. But te-day the German army is
on tie run on beth the castern and western
fronts, sud is îlisiutcgrating se rapidiy that
fie Reich may be forced inte uneondîtienal surrender within a feuv weeks-the soner the
hetter.
It seema te me that tîsat statement is justified by the reports that xve receive frorn the,
xvar censtres. Field Marsîsal Montgomery and

MARGH 29, 1945
General Eisenhower, whio are probably best
qualified to speak on the matter, have indicated that the German armaies are disintegrating and are now on the run. 1 arn hopeful
that a few woeks--this does flot mean one
week, two weeks or throe weeks, but a few
weeks-may bring about the complete defeat
of the enemy.
I have no complaint to make about the
Canadian Press, which I arn sure tries, under
difficulties, to report accurate]y what is said
in this Chamber as well as in the other buse,
but I feol 1 arn justified in calling attention
to the item in thi.- morning's Journal with
a view to correcting the statement made
by the press.
THE GOVERNOR
ADDRESS

GENERALIS SPEECH
IN REPLY

The Sonate resumed f rom Tuesday,'March
27, the consideration of His Excellenc The
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt for an Address in roply thereto.
Hon. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, I dosire to say a few words
in the dobate on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
First I wish to
associate mysoîf with honourable members
who have congratulated the mover (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) of the Address, on their
splendid speeches.
As I have not as mnuch ability as many
honourable senators have for public speaking,
and as I intond to quote a goud many statistics in the course of my remarks, 1 trust 1
shall be forgiven if 1 make frequent references to notes.
Europe is to-day the dark continent. It has
~becomne a problem to every human being. Tihe
world's leaders plan its future and their task
is more difficoît because Europe is entering now
its darkest phase.
These are the wsords usod in a report made
by one of the New York Times' representativos abroad; and for the purpose of expanding the point, 1 hope honourable senators
wi]l bear with me while I quote bim further.
Hatred can be a meaningless word to, one who
bas not s2en the thjngs that breed it. A Serbian
corpse being hacked te pieces by Croatians.
French MUaquis bodies mutilated by the Gestapo.
A Ruffsian sergeant picked up wounded by a
German patrol aud tortured, beaten and shot;
but not killed. A Greek woman beating ber
head on the ground because ber brothers and
parents were killed by other Greeks. Italians
killing Albanians. 300 bodies of Italians iu
the Catacombe in Rome, ebot in cold blood by
Germans.
A Dutcb naval officer described

37

watcbing, while helpless in biding, a Nazi truck
driver deliberately smash a small boy's arm.
These things engender hate, lasting hate.
Military deaths have topped ten million; but
direct and devious German
brutalities,
designed to reduce inimical populations
either by slaughter or planned famine and
disease, have caused the deaths of two or
tbree times this numbor-and the end is not
yet.
Whole populations have been mov-cd so that
the' do not know to what nation they belong.
Millions of well-fed Nazi prisoners in Allied
hnandý will ho returned to their country not
by any means indoctrinated by dcmorratic
ideas; and when a battalion from an American
prison camp returns to the conquered Reich it
will possibly be far less convinced of the disaster of Hitler's philosophy than those who w-ý,re
able 10 see doomn roll forward from the East
and the West and the skies.
The problem of supervising the return to
their various homes of millions of prisoners
within the Reich-either captured soldiers or
seized slave labourers--is enormous in itself.
And what authority will arrange their return?
Who will employ them te rebuild their shattered homes, and who will hielp them flnd tl--eir
scattered families?
When one thinks of Europe's economic
problems as they exist to-day, one can only
(lescribo them as a statistician's headache and
a humanitarian heartache. Added to disrupted
and almost paralysed transportation and confusion is hunger and homelessness; the fact
is that there is not a single land, either in
Europe or bordering it, which is not suffering
from varying and tremendous degrees of
inflation.
The cost of living, if living is possible at
ail te the masses, is exorbitant. Most national
curroncies are valueless, except where they are
propped up by Allied financing. Wages, in
relation to prices. are whoily insufficient. Markets do not exist in large areas because of
ruined communication systems. Raýw material
and machinery shortages make consumer goods
unavailâble. In France, officiai prices rose 120
per cent .between
1939 and the liberation;
while black market prices rose anywherc from
1.000 te, 1,500 per cent. About sixty per cent
of Italy's industrial capacity
bas been
de9troyed and production is virtually at a
standstili.
Prices are spirailing upward-except on
Allied-controlied ration markets. An ordinary
Fiat car previousiy costing 40,000 lire is now
lieid at 350,000 lire. Italian mirrency circulation bas incrcased 1,150 per cent, and the
country faces complote bankruptcy. In Belgilim prices have advanced far beyond wages,

creating a dangerous gap. The Allies are
employing over 800,000 Belgians, but tliere are
In
nearly baîf a million without w'ork.
England wholesalc prices have risen seventy
per cent. Note circulation bas doubled and
gold coin lias almost vanished-inflation us a
tlangerous tlîreat.
Ail these miiseries bave stimiulated a craving
for a new social eider aIl over Europe, and
tItis crax ing Las strong]y expressed itself in
Comiinisru. The rapidly crumbling industrial calossus of Germany is te add te tîtithreat.
Great Brîtain and the United St.ates rcagnize tItis threat and ail its imptlications, and
have agrced on partial relief, such as that
furnished by UNRRA. But few of us realýly
appreciate the enormous task ahead: first, of
fccding these people quickly ta hcad off revalution-for wbich there is ne greater cause
than hurtger-and then of rcstoring responsibie
government. To date, the distribution of food
las been followed by black markets in bath
Italy and Greece. Certainly many people will
look ta tLe newv world in the hiope of coming
over and starting life again. To avoid lapsing
it complete pcssimism, anc should remnember
that the continent of Europe recovered from
the Thirty Yeaî's War, frein the Blaek PMague,
froit the War of 1914-18; anti while this surcly
us the werst disaster ever te have Leen faced,
we must face ut Lopefully.
Now let us look at aur own ability te help.
Thýe President of the United States said:
It is a matter of juistice or rather ef deeency
that the Ainerican people shouild tighten their
Leits to keelp others froni starvuuC. niaintainiilg

and et er add îng ta
This equally applies te Canada. The United
States statistics show that civilians are eating
19 pounds more meat per person per year than
in 1039. In 1944 (lhe average xvas 145 pounds
per persen per ye'sr as against 126 po-unds in
1939. The 1945 figures mnay show a sharp reduetion to 120 peuinds. Canada in 1944 uscd
157 poundcs per peî'son per year. Great Britain
Soldiers and sailors arc

gctting 350 pounds. The drought in Australia
is making it necessary for the Allies te draw on
the United States ta, a greater degrce than contcmplated, and a eut in park production lias
furthcr depleted the domestie larder, w'hich
also complicates the shipping situation.
Statistics show that food is the first thing
purchascd by an individual whcn Lis income
increases. Supplies of whcat available for expert in Canada, the Argentine and the United
States on .Tanîîary 1, 1945, after allowing for
domnestic consutiption and carry-over, are estimated at about 850 million bushels. The United
States carry-over of wheat at July 31l is estiHon. Mr. PATERSON.

mated at from 350 to 375 million bushels; that
of Canada at 476 million. Let me say here
that, it has been a matter of great comfort ta
the Allies to have this surplus as a back log.
Bc'causeo f the nessity of keeping adequate
supplies for possible emergencies at. home, not
ail of this wheat is available for export. In
the present crop year from August 1, 1944, ta
March 16, 1945, we have exported only 1'55
million busheils as compared ta 200 million
bushels exported for the same period a ycar
ago; and I w ould suggest that the cause of
this falling off might be England's increased
production and the shortage of shipýping ta
other places.
I should like ta try t.a explain ta this lionourable bady why, in the face of starvation in

w.hat 1 have said how near ta insuperable are
the dýifficulties of transportation across the

fully appreciate the position one must remember that, the damage donc in Europe bas been
donc to cities not ta the agricultural fields.
Alrcady in France and Italy, Belgium and
Rumania, as well as in parts of Poland and
other countries, spring seeding is in full swing.
In war-torn Germany the people may miss thec

low level.
Everyonie in, North Ame-rica
mnust realize that in order to avert another war
we may have to corne down in our standard
of living while we raise that of Europe. We
will certainly fight against lowering our standard of living, but inevitably, if we manufacture more than we can seli, we must sooner
or later either curtail production or find new
customers. Much will have to. be accomplished
at San Francisco before Europe and Asia will
be stabilized and in a po6ition to take the
surplus products of our agriculture and labour,
and we shaîl avoid disappointment by not
expecting
immediate
results
from. the
conference.
The task of stabilizing Europe is stupendous:
to satisfy Poland may mean- war with Russia;
to satisfy Hungary rnay mea.n more trouble
with Bulgaria. This critical situation can be
met oniy by the best bramae and by the exercise on ahl sides of the utmost patience and
toleration. The most hopeful feature is that
every thinking person is al-ive to the gravity of
the situation and is following it with sustained interest. A way will be found, but we
shail ail have to contribute our part. We may
take comfort from, the fact that a start bas
been made; but let no one forget that we are
fighting the greateet war in history and that
the first caîl on our shipping space is for the
transport of ammunition and food for our
troops. This is more important than feeding
civilians on the continent, and when shipping
is available 1 would say Canadians are prepared to tighlen their belts and do their full
share.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McRae the debate
was adjourn-ed.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CONFERENCE
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resurned frorn yesterday the
adjourned debate on the moftion of Hon. Mr.
Kinýg:
That is it expedient that the Huses of
Parliainent do approve the following resolution:
Whereas the Government of Canada has been
invited by the Government of the United States
of America, on behaîf of itself and of the
governments of the United Kingdom cf Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, -the Union of
Soviet Socia.list Republies and the Republie of
China, to send representatives to a conference
of the United Nations to be held on April 25,
1945, at San Francisco in the United States of
America to prepare a charter for a general
international organization for the maintenance
of international peace -and security, and
Whereae the invitation suggests tha-t the conference consider as afford.ing a baais for such
a charter the proposals tor the establishment

of a general international organization which
have been mnade public by the four governments which participated in the discussions at
Dumbarton Gake, Washington, and
Whereas the Government of Canada has
accepted the invitation te send representatives
te this conference,
Therefore be it resolved:
1. That this bouse endorses the acceptance hy
the Government of Canada of the invitation to
send representatives te the conference.
2. That this bouse recognizes that the establishment of an effective initern.ational organizatien for the maintenance of international peace
and security is cf vital importance te Canada,
and, indeed, te the future well-being of manikind; a.nd it is in the interests of Canada that
Canada should become a meanher cf such an
organization;
3. That thi8 bouse approves the purposes and
principles set forth ini the proposals of the four
goveroments, and censiders that these proposaIs
constitute a 8satief-actory general bauis for a
discussion cf the charter of the proposed international organization;
4. That this House agreee that the representatives cf Canada at the conference should use
their hast endeavours te further the preparation
of an acceptable charter for an international
orgnization for the maintenance cf international peace and security;
5. That the charter establishing the international erganization should, before rattfication,
be subm.itted te Parliament for approval.
Hon. A. K. HIUGESSEN: Honourable senators, in resurning the debate on this resolution
I may say I arn struck, as I th-ink eve.ry hýonourable member must be struck, by its extrema
importance. I do not imagine .that any more
important resolution has ever corne befora
this honourable body tbhan the one whieh is
now under consideration.
It cornes te us,
honourable senators, wi'th a very sombre background. Some aspects of that sombre background have been discussed this afternoon- by
the honourable senator from Fort William
(Hon. Mr. Paterson) in another debate. It
is a background cf two devastating world wars
within the course cf one generation. This
resolution ýreflects the hope-some people say
it is the only hope-that in future the world
will be able to avoid the desolations of the
past twenty-five years.
Now, what is this resolution? It refers in the
preamble te the proposals for a new organizaýtien to maintain international peace and
security, as tentatively agreed upon by the
four great powers at the recent Dumbarton
Oaks conference and sl.ightly modified at the
Yalta Conderence cf a few weeks ago. Then it
refers te the invitation extanded 'to this Government by the Government of the United
States te taka part in a conferenca to ba held
in San Francisco for thre purpose cf considering these proposals.

SENATE
The body of the resolution conisists of five
paragraphs. First of ail, it endorses the acceptance of that invitation by our Government.
Secondiy, it recognizes the vital importance to
Canada of an organization for the maintenance
of peace in the worid, and that Canada shouid
Thirdly, it

approves the purposes and principies of these
proposais as set out at Dumbarton Oaks,
without of course approving every detail of
them. Fourthiy, it suggests that the representatives of Canada at the conferenca should
use their beat endeavours to further the organization of this international body for the maintenance of peace. Fifthiy, it says that any
organýization ultimately set up at the San
Francisco Conference must be submitted for
t.he approval of the Parliamant of Canada.
The proposais are set aut in the pamphlet
di8tributed to lionotirable memhcîs. who. 1 am
sure, hiave read theni with the grc itesl of
care. Let me repeat, these propoFsais are not
final. It is quite clear that tihey may b-e
modified, and in affect they no doubt. will be,
in greater or lessar degree, as a result of the
San Francisco conference. But thase proposais
as they now stand represent the measure of
agreement which the four great allied powr-the United States, Great Britain, ýRussia and
China-have so far been able to, reach hetween
thamselvas as to the form and substance of
the functions of t.his new international organizatian.
It is int.eresting to observe that, genarally
spaaking, the form proposed for this new
organization fallows rather eiosely the form of
the prasent League of Nations, though there
are some dýiffarences in the machinýery. The
proposais cali for a General Assembiy, a
Security Council, an International Court of
The G.eneral
Justice. and a Sacretariat.
Assembiy corresponds to the present Assembiy
of the League, the Security Council corresponds
roughly to tha Council of the League, the
International Court of Justice and the Sacratariat are more or less substantively similar to
axisting bodies under the League.
But it is important to note that. in these
proposais there are two naw organizations
which have no place in the League of Nations.
The llrst is a Milit.ary Staff Conimittae, which
is to be responsibia for the use of such forces
as the Security Council may find necessary to
employ in order to put dlown aggrassion in any
part af the world; and the second is an
Ecanomie and Social Council of ecighteen menabers appointed by the General Assembiy, whose
funation wiii be to "facilitate solutions of
international
economie, social a nd. other
humanitarian probiams and, promote respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
lion. Mr. HUGESSEN.

So if, wiil be observed that under these proposais the oid League set-up bas heen
strengthened. in two ways: first, with respect ta
warlikae praparatians; for the enforcament of
security, and, secondiy, with respect to peacefuI progress along aconomie and social linas.
I want to deal for a few minutes with, the
composition of the Security Council as suggested here. As honourabie members know,
the Cauncil is to cansist of eleven membars.
The five big powers-Great Britain, the United
States, China, Russia and France-who are te,
have permanent seats on the Council, wiii be
reprasantad by one member each. The other
six mambers of the Co-uncil are to, be reprasentatives of countrias chosen by t.he General
Assembly. Thaey are to be electad for a period
of two years and will not, have the privilege of
immediate re-election. The function of the
Sacurity Council, its primary abject, is to guard
the peace of the world, whereas under the
League of Nations the rasponsibility for keaping the peace of the warld resta equally upon
the Assembly and the Council.
There are people who say that these proposais are very heavily weighted in favour of
the five great powers who are to ba' the permanent members of the Security Council,
an( 1I suppose there is a gaod deal to ha
said for that contention. I should like for a
moment to deal with the discussion wbiah
tarie here ycsterdaýy afternoon out of a question
asked by the honourahie senator froin
Waterloo (Mon. Mr. Euler), as ta whether a
permanent member of the Security Council,
ana of the five great. powers, could prevent. the
Council from deaiing with any dispute ta
which that great power itself was a party.
The an*swer ta that, if I may be permitted t,
ge. e my interpretatian of it. is in two parts.
If hanourabieý senatars wili examine the proposais they will sec that the Security Council
lias two different modes of action. The first
i's dealt with in Chapter 8, section A, under
It c-omprisesý polwer ta investigata disputes that
àrise, ta make recommandations for their pacific settlement, ta rafer questions ta the international court and ta make reparts. The
,-eeoond list of functions of the Secîurity
Council is under section B. This rebates ta
what liappens if a peacaful sattiamant pr-oves
abortive and the ecanamiw sanctions or, ultimateiy. miiitary sanctions, have ta ha enforced
against the offandiog power.
With that division in mind, it is interesting
to refer ta the provision, for vating by the
Secîîrity Couneil, in Chapter 6, section C,
paragraph 3:
Decisionis of the Security Canneil an -ail ather
matters should he made by an affirmative vote

M.ARCH 29,1945
of seven members inc.luding the conicu'rring vote
of the permainent members;If that stood by itself it would mean that
all the five, great powers would have to agree
to everything that the Seourity Council did,
but the paragraph bas been modified in this
way:
provided that, in decisions under Chapter 8,
section A,
and in another matter of minor importance-a
Party to a dispute should abstain from
voting.
That means that if one of the Big Five
powers is a party to a dispute which cornes
before the Security Council, that power cannot vote ini any proceedings under section Athat is, for the pacifie settlement of -the
dispute. In other words, it cannot prevent the
Security Council from attempting to deal
with the dispute by investigating it, or making recommendations or referring matters of
law to the courts, and so on. But in respect
of any action proposed under section B of
Chapter 8, that is economic or military'sanctions, an-y one of the Big Five powers ean
vote and say, "No, I refuse to allow economic
or military sanctions to be taken against me."
A good de-al bas been said. I think with considerable justification, to the effect that this
amounts to dictation by the great powers.
Perhaps it does. On the other haud, I suppose
it can be said with equal truth that it is no
more than the recognition of the faets of life,
because no matter ivhat international organization you set up you cannot 'really coerce a
great power. If you attempt to do that the
ultimate resuit will be war, and your international organization will fall ýto the ground.
To give a g.reat power the right of veto under
these circurnstances is merely to recognize the
fact that that great powe.r cannot be coerced.
Hon. Mr. KING: May 1 interrupt for a
moment? I arn pleased that my honourable
friend bas taken this opportunity to clarify
the matter now under discussion. W-hen my
honourable frietid fram Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) raised a question in regard to it yesterday I was not certain as to just what voting
rights the five great powiers wouldh4ave, and I
intimated to hýim that I would try to clarify
the point. Ths.t *has now been done by the
honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen).
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: On this question of
dictatorship by the great powers there bhas
been a good deal of discussion, and I should
like for a few moments to direct the attention
of the House to somne staternents made by various prominent members of the British
Government.

This is what the Right Honourable Anthony
Eden said on November 16 last:
If the United St'ates, Russia, France and ourWeves can work together, understand each
otj>er, and resolve our problems, I believe that
o of this war a long period of pence may corne.
There may bie some who eay that that means a
great power dictation. Believe me, it means
no such thing. The truth. is that unless the
great powers oan work together -the foundations
of peace are not there.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: And Sir Alexander
Cadogan, Under-Secretary
of the British
Foreign Office, and one of the British representatives at Dumbarton Oaks, is quoted as
follows:
No one wishes ta impose oome great power
dittatorship on the rest of the world; but it is
qbvious that unless the great powers are united
lin airn and ready te assume and fulfil loyally
their obligations, ns machine for maintaining
peace, however perfectly constructed, will in
pracdice work.
At this time,' honourable senators, I should
like to deal with the position of Canada at
the San Francisco conference. We have heard
a great deal in the lat few months about
Canada being one of the middle powers of
the world. I think that as a reSuit of the war
effort that this, country bas put forth during

the last few years, that is perfectly true.
Perhaps it is also true that the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals do insufficiently recognize the
position of the middle powersSomne Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -and that modifications may be advisable in that respect. I
cannot help, however, rather deprecating the
idea that our delegation to San Francisco

should try to push this country into the leadership of the middle powers, and should make
dlaims and advance demands merely to show
how important we have becorne.
Somne Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It seems to me, if
I may be pardoned for saying se, that throwing
one's weight around, merely for the sake of
showing that one bas the weight to throw
around, is a rather adolescent conception.
Moreover, I believe such an attitude is totally unnecessary in our own interest.
I should like honourable senators to consîder for a few minutes the position which
Canada will occupy in this new set-up. It la
an exceptionally favourable one. It la far
more favourable than the position ever was
under the League of Nations, to which. the
United States was not a party. Consider for
a moment the composition of the Seourity
Council. Under these proposais the two

for gond meastire that France, a country from
which ncarlv one-third of our people derive
tâhdr racial origin. i. to be a ihird member of
the Security Couincil. I think we can sac with
the greatest confidence that Canada ivili neyer
laek friends on the Security Corrncil. To put
it another wvay, the fact that Canada will not
alvays, or ev en oftcýn. have its own representative on the Security Counicil will probably be
le,.s important to us than to any other country
of middle rank in the world.
This war has taugbt us ail many lessons. One
of the lcssous it has taugbt is that Canada,
geograpbicaily speaking, is essentiai for the
d-efence of not onix" Great Britain but the
United States as weli. Take the case cf Great
Britain. During the course of this war we
have proved to be the lifeline from. Great

the great resources of this continent. I think
it is truc, te .savý that if there had been no
Canada, if we had disappc arcd off :the, faee of

back te the Christian religion. Wbat is the
resull cf that?
1 tbink we rau confidentx- say that on1 bruad
questions cf international pelicy our three
counitries generally think alike te reach the
samne conclusion. Let me again put this phase
cf my remarks in the form cf a question. Can
anýyne imagine a case in whicb, Great Britain
and the United States as permanent members
cf the Security Council baving agreed to take
certain international action together, Canada
would refuse te go aiong? If. for instance, tbe
United States and Great Britain agreed te impose sanctions aud te apply force somewbere
te preveut aggression, does any bonourable
senator tbink for a moment that ccir couîntry
would bang back aud refuse te do her share?
To ask, tbis question is te answer it very emphatically indeed. If I may repeat, in the new
world organization Canada will oceupy au. exceptionaily fortunate position, and. for that
reason I de net tbink it is necessary or even
wise for us te att.empt te ferre our way te the
front at San Francisco as the spokesman cf the
middle natins. or to clamour for a permanent.
place on the Security Council. Frcm wbat I
have just said I do ot wish it te be implied
that I have any idea that or country should
take a bark seat or bide bhiud the skirts cf
Great Britain and the United States. I am
îcroccd of ocîr country, and I xvant nur country
to play its full part in thbe new international
organization; -but I suggest, boneurabie senators. that the Dumbarton Oaks prepesals give
us mucb more cause fer satisfaction than fer
dissatisfactinn. Te use the nid adage, it is well
not t. -look a gift horse in the moutb.
Lct me agaîn emphasize that 0cr- positin

than it was under the Leagite of Nations.
Iincir the Loaigîe cf Nations, Canada stood

That brinigs me to the next peint I wisb te

43

MARCH 29, 1945
think wc shall agree among ourselves that it
was nct-nay 1 say?-a very virile attitude.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 believe it can be
said truthfully that in general we tried aur
best ta escape from any obligations under the
covenant of the League.
Bath political
parties, alternately in! power during that period.
were equally responsible.
Two examples
corne to my mind. The first is the attitude of
the Bcennett Government in 1932. at the time
of the Japanese invàsion of Manchuria, when
that Government at lcast talerated and certainly did nothing ta discourage Japanese
aggressicn. I have under rny hand the Parliamentary debates of the other Chamber for
the session af 1932-33 containing a report of
a speech made on the l6th cf May, 1933, by
the late Honourable C. H. Cabian. at that tirne
Secretary of State, de-fending the position hie
had taken at the conferen-ce of the League in
Geneva in December, 1932, when Japanese
aggression ivas under consideration. That
speech, I must say. contains littie else but a
long catalogue of excuses for Ja.pan's action,
followed by a long set of reasonis why Canada
sh&,uld do niothing about it. But cf course
thc Bennett Government was by no means
solely responsible for that attitude. Let me
rernind honourable senîatomrs of the attitude.
in December, 1935. of the Government cf the
presenit day. At that trne it publicly disavowved Dr. Riddell, Canadian representative
at Geneva, when hie proposed oil sanctions
against Italy, then engaged in a brutal
attack agaiýnst Ahyssinia, a fellow member of
the League.
I repeat, honourahle senatars, aur attitude
during that period w-as, ta say the least. ot
very virile-not very inspiriog. But it rnay
very well have been necessary for Canada ta
adopt that attitude at the time because of aur
isclated position as the sole member cf the
Leagiie of Nations in this part of the warld,
and because cf uncertainty as ta the position
aur great neighbour to the south wvoild have
taken if Canada had heen dragged ino a war
in the Atlantic or the Pacifie as a result of
the imposition cf sanctions against Italy or
Japan. Moreover, I think it is only fair ta
say that Canada was by ne means alone in
the attitude she teck during that period.
ilon. Mr. HAIG: Was any member-nation
in favour cf the League taking action against
Japan?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I was just going
ta rernark that the whcle trouble lay in the
inherent weakness cf the arganization of tlie
League.
32289-4,ý

Hcn. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman?
Did oct the
UJnited States favour intervention against
Japan in regard ta the Manchurian incident?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I rather think the
Ulnited States did. Fer several years there
bas been a continuing dispute between Mr.
Stirnson and Sir Johin Simnon, the two statesmen representing the United States and Great
Britain rez.pectively at that t'me. as ta, what
artually hapipeord. To mny mind, the inherent
weakness cf the Lcague of Nations wvas this:
every member was haîînd tc resist aggressian
against its fellow members. but it wis left to
each member ta say what force, if any, it
wciîld uise shciîld occasian arise. Thecrctically,
each member was an the sarne footing; for
instance, Canada and Nicaragua, France and
Siam. Moreaver, there was no pravision for
an internattional arrned foi-ce, nur for consîiitaticn between the chiefs cf the general staffs
cf the varions member-couintries. It was the
old story-everyhody's business became nebody's business. I think we cao at least coscle aurselves hy refiecting that that mnistake
is being avcided by the present proposils.
These provide for a military staff and fcr the
immediate use of arrned forces by the Ccuncil
in case af aggressian.

you and I agree on that.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question at tîrat point? Suppose, for instance. tîrere is trouble between
Trrrkv v and Grecce, and tire inalter comes

N"o agreement can be

wrth it when the efficient discharge of the
coîrrrrittee's responsibilities requires that such
a state should participate in its work.
,Suppose thiere was trouble between Turkey
and Greece, and Turkey the aggressor; I
would assume that the agreement whicha the
Security Council had made with the different
counitries of the world wouid provide for
regional security. It wouid require that, in
the flrst instance, the armcd forces of the
countries nearest to the place whiere the trouble
arose shouid be called upon, and that oniy
after hiey liad proved to be insufficient wouid
counitries further away from the scene of
trouble have to send their forces. Then as
soon as any country wvas required to send its
forces to the support of the Security Counicil
it would atitomatically become a member of
the rniiitary staff cornmittee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I suppose we wouid
ha ve the righit to assume as well that in the
event of suchl a squabble, Canada's representative on the Couril would throughout the

MÀRCH 29, 1945
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I read the
Prime Minister's speech somewhat cursorily,
but I understood hima to say that neither he
nor the delegation for the Goverument of
whichi he is head wouid enter into any commitments whatsoever. How can the honourable gentleman reconcile th at statement with
the statement he has just made? Our representative on the Council would not have
authority to commit this country to take action
against an aggressor nation. The Security
Council would say, "Weli, Canada, we should
like you to contribute so and so." Is it not
a fact that an agreement has first to be drawn
up?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I understood the
Prime Minister ta say that neither he nor the
delegation couid bind this country in any way;
ail they couid do, as the resolution itself sets
out, would be to come back with the agreed
proposais and submit them to Parliament for
approvai.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Exactiy.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: When this country
becomes, a member of the organization and
the Security Council la set up, then the Security
Couincil makes an agreement with this country
and every other country, providing that in
future, if and when the emergency arises, this
country and the other countries wili make
available certain miiitary forces for the use_
of the Security Council.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to interrupt my honourabie friend again, but
ho has gone away beyond the statement made
by the Prime Minister yesterday andHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I, too. am sorry
to interrupt my honourabie friend. I think
in bis speech yesterday afternoon in the other
Chamber the Prime Minister made it perfectly clear that he was not responsibie for
these proposais. They are proposais agreed
upon between the four great powers, and submitted by themn for consultation with the other
powers.
Hlon. .Mr. CALDER: They may be modified.
Hon.. .Mr. HUGFESSEN: They may be modified. Hie was siinply saying that he was flot
responsible for these proposais or for anything
that appears in thema at present.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Quite so.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If the Canadian
delegation to the conference agrees to these
proposais, he and- other members of the delegation will bave to report back to Pariiament
and seek*parliimenýtary sanction of the organi-

46

zation as weii as of the iong-term agreements
for the use of military for-ce.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE : Exactly.
Hon. Mr. CALDERI: Every country which
is represented at the conference will have to
ratify any agreements that are made there
before they enu be binding upon that, countryHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
I strongly hope that the Canadian delegate&
to the San Francisco conference will express the
wiilingness of this country immediateiy to enter,
into thîs worid organization and to make an
agreement with the Security Council covering
the terms and conditions under which our military forces wiii be avaiiable for the purposes
of the Council if and when the necessity should
arise. It is perfectly true that once we have
signed an agreement of that kind and it is
ratified by Parliament we shall -have su.rrendered a part of our national sovereignty. We
shail have bound ourselves to obey orders from
this international organization-on which Canada may not, be directly represented at the
time--to put part of our armed forces a.t its
disposai, for the maintenance of peace and the
repeliing of aggression. We have got to face
tbat fact. It is no use hiding our heads in the
sand. That may mean that somne day our
Canadian boys wiil have to go to a distant part
of the worid to fight against an aggressor
nation. It is a serious obligation ta assume,
but I venture to urge that we, in common with
the other nations which form part of the organization, must assume it if peace is to be
maintain-ed. And surely, honourable senators,
the very fact of such a pledge by Canada and
ail the other United Nations will have a profound effect leb deterrlng potentiai aggressors in
the future. It was just the very want of
specific provisions of that kind, and the employment, instead, of f oggy and miasmýie expressions of pious aspiration w'hich t.urnd
thbe League of Nations into the iaughing-stock
which it uitimately became.
People taiýk of the surrender of part of our
sovereignty as if it were a very terrible thing,
-but I contend'that it is necessary for us to
surrender part of our sovereignty, if we are ta
ensure peace. In the past there has been too
much insistence on the sacred right of every
sovereign nation to hehave exactly as it wished,
regardiess of the h.armn it might cause to others.
One lesson we have learned in this war is that
no nation can now afford to live by itself alone.
In the United States there has &~en- a great
deal of debate on this subjeet of partial surrender of national sovereignty in tbe interests

SENATE

of the new international organization. I should
like to quote to honourable members two remarks made in that connection by Commander Harold Stassen, the young and brilliant
ex-Governor of Minnesota, who lias been prominently mentioned as the next Republican candidate for President. For the last three years
lie has been serving with the United States
Navy in the Pacifie, and he has been named
by President Roosevelt as one of the United
States delegates to the San Francisco conference. He said:
That we (1o not subscribe to the extreme
view of nationalistic sovereignty; that we realize
that nîeither tIis nation nor any other nation
eau be a law unto itself . . . and that we are
willing to delegate a limited portion of our
national sovereignty to our united nations
organization.

And again:
There may be dipl.omats who do not know it;
there may be many po-litical leaders who are
afraid to admit it; there may be many people
who

do not

understand

it,

but

the extreae

principle of absolute nationalistic sovereignty
is of the miiddle ages and it is dead. It diied
with the aeroplane, the radio, the rocket and
the robomb.

There lias also been considerable discussion
by the Senate of the United States on the
analogous question of whether Congress should
give up part of its right to declare war by conferring upon an international organization the
power to order American forces to be sent
abroad to repel aggression. I was in'terested
in the report of a speech made in the United
States Senate on September 19 last year by
Senator Ball, a Republican, from Minnesota.
I quote from t-he report:
The question raised here was whether the
United States quota force shouli be usetd to
stop aggression at the direction of the Security
Council, the American

representative agreeing,

unless Congress had formally declared war.
He said: "The world security organization
would not be making war, but preserving the
peace. Its whole purpose is to eliminate war
lie whole
from the world, not make it .- .
house ot world security would tunble down if
one essential pillar were nissing-a strit international law against military aggression and
the means to enforce it.
Suppose there was a clear case of aggression
in South Anierica, the senator continued. the
United States would want it stopped quickly,
but if the position taken by sone prevailed,
Congress would have to declare war on the
aggressor nation before United States forces
could act. Under the proposed plan, however,
the international organization woultd use an
international force to stop the aggression. There
would be no declaration of war, but instead
joint international

action

to

preserve

PCt

He asked: "Under whiclh method would the
United States be likely to retain the gool will
of tleir South American neighbours? Under
one plan each individual nation would be forced

to declare w-ar in order to preserve peace; umi r
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

otlher. the w orld comnlunity of nations
would do a policing job on international outlaws.
Which inakes better sense, and which is mnost
the

likely to preserve peace?"

I am sure all honourable senator; followed
with a great deal of interest, as I did, the
debate on this resolut.ion in another place,
and I am equally sure that they were pleased,
as I was. with the virtual unanimity of opinion exprcssed by the vote taken there yesterday afternoon. There are only two elements
in our national life, both of very miner
importance, who may be said to have opposed
this resolution. The first is composed of
extreme nationalists, the so-called Independents, frotm my own province of Quebec. These
gentlemen live in a dream world of their
own, a world of racial miasmas, inferiority
complexes, and Communist bogies. The second
elenient is composed of gentlemen who
advocate the doctrines of social credit.
Those gentlemen seem to have arrivecd
-by wlat proeess of reasoning I am unable
to imagine-at the conclusion that all the
Dumbarton Oaks proposals were prepared by
wicked international financiers. Well, honourable senators, these two elements may well bc
termed the lunatic fringes of our politi-al life.
and I do not think we need pay very much
attention to their views on this particular
naa(tter.
But there is one trend of thought which is
a little critical of Canada's attitude at Dumbarton Oaks.
Some people think it will
weaken our ties with the rest of the Commonwealth; and now some people are saying that

Canada should go to the San Francisco conference purely as a member of the British Empire,
and form a united front with the other Commonwealth countries. I do not share those
views, in so far as I understand them. In the
first place, I find it difficult to think anybody
really blieves that Canada's participation in
the San Francisco conference or in the international organization which will result therefrom could in any way injure our relations
with the otlier members of the Commonwealth
family. The tics that bind Canada and the
other members of the British Commonwealth
are priiarily ihose of sentiment: they are ties
of blood and of loyalty on the part of all to our
conimon Sovereigns. The peoples of the Commonwealth hold the same concepts of human
governient and liberty. Tics of .this sort are
on a level entirely different from that of the
political arrangements which it is proposed
should be entered into with fifty or sixty other
governments for the

purpose

of maintaining

I would differentiate our relations
peace.
with the Commonwealth fron our relations
with the otiher members of this proposed

MARACH 29, 11N45
international organization by a simple analogy:
our relations with the Commonwealth are
family relations; with the others, friendly business relations. Canada bas been a' member
of the League of Nations since 1919, but it
would be a bold man who would say that 'ber
me.mnbership in the League du-ring ail that
time bas 'had an.y injurîous effect upon ber
relations with the other members of the
Commonwealth.
1 rather deprecate also the suggestion that
has been made in some quarters that Canada
should form a united front with the, other
nations of the Commnonwealth at San Francisco. Canada is a nation, and we can stand
on our own feet as a nation at San Francisco. I
believe tbat if honourable members will reflect
on this point they will realize tbat each nation
of the Commonwealth will carry more weigbt
and will be listened to witb gzieater respect by
the oth-er nations if it speaks for itself as
representative of its own particular part of the
world. I think it might have a very bad
effect upon the oth-er nations of the world if
they went, to the San Francisco conference
with the suspicion in their minds that the
members of the Britisb Commonwealth had
been "ganging Up" together beforehand to try
to, "put sometbing over" on tbem.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESS]EN: The wbole trend, of
the debate in the other place, and in this
Chamnber, bas been to empbasize the importance of tbe Security Council. I arn ratber
inclined to ask m-yseif whether in the long run
tbe Security Coijocil will be the most important instrument provided for in. this set-up.
I am inclined to tbink that in tbe future the
real permanent developiments of international
relations are very likely to corne through the
Eeocnomic -and Social Council peovided for in
Chapter 9, as well as the varions organizations that will be, tributary to it. At the same
timne, of course, it is very n-atural that our
thýougbts sbould turn to the Security Council,
its future and its functions. We aire in the
niidst of war and for the last five or six years
our minds bave been filled with. war and
tbreats of war and the prevention of war in the
future. I suggest to honourable mexabers tbat
they might ask themneelves wbether an international conflict is lîkely to take place within
the next three or four generations.
I was very m-uch impressed by a remark
made by President Roosevelt in the course of
his famous "quarantine speech" at Ch.icago,
delivered in 1937, in which be said that ninety
per cent of the people of the world desire
peace, and only ten per cent want war for
the purpose of world domination. He was

47

obviously pointing tbe finger at Germany and
Japan. What wiIl be the position after this
war is over? Germany and Japan will be
bopelessly defeated, their territory and their
population will b-e greatly reduced, and tbey
will bave been deprived of the means of
making war in the foreseeable future. I thinc
that is basic and axiomatic. If we look back
on the bistory of western civilization it is
rather interesting to observe that potentîal
world conquerors turn up about once every
hundred years. There was Philip of Spain in
the seventeentb century; Louis Quatorze of
France in the eigbteenth century, Napoleon
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and
Kaiser Wilhelm and bis degenerate successor
at the beginning of the twentieth century. I
think history will record tbis war as more or
less a continuation of the last Great War, and
the two together as tbe supreme attempt of
the German nation to conquer the world. If
that historical perspective be truc, it may well
be that we have seen the end of attempts
at world domination for some generations to
corne. What will the. position be? Germany
-and Japean wilI be wrecked, ruined and repressed; tihe victorious Allies will be the
dominant politieal force of the future world;
the four grea.t powers, !the United States, the
British Commonwealth, Russia and China, will
have irresistible forces at their oomznand..
Under these circumstances, is a war of worldwide significance likely to take place in the
foreseeable future?
Witb regard to ourselves and the British
Commonwealth of Nations there is no question.
War is repugnan-t to us ail, it violates our
most cherisbed principles. There is no danger
that eitber the United States or the British
Commonwealth would attempt to engage in a
world war in the future. I think it is equally
true to say tbat there is no danger to be
apprehended from eithcr Russia or China. You
can usually judge the future behaviour of a
country from its past bistory. Neither Russia
nor China bas ever set -out to conquer the
world, and neither of tbem bas ever given
out the idea that they -are the "master race"
or tbe "sons of heaven" and that therefor
they bave an, inherent rigbt by their own
destiny to coniquer tbe inferior nations of the
world for the purpose of ruling tbem. Both
Russia and China are countries of vast extent
and great resources wbich are largely untouched. Neither of them is a "Have-not" nation.
Botb bave sustained enormous material damage in this war. I pause to suggest that for
many years to come the energies of both
these nations will have to be devoted to the
reconstruction and development of their own
countries and to the raising of the standard

48

of living of their own people. It is rather
interesting to speculate that during the next
century Russia may occupy the position the
United States occupied in the nineteenth century-a great country cnncerned oniy with its
own development, and anxious flot to be disturbed by happenings in the outside wor]d.
It is even conceivable that our grandsons may
have cause to ho annoyed at Russian isolationism in the saine way that this generation
bias at times had cause to regret the isolationism of the United States. Ail of whjch leads
me back te what I said a few minutes ago,
that if what I have predicted cornes true, it
ii verv probable tinat the Economie and
Social Council and not the Security Council
will be the most important cf the organizations set up under this plan.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

function in economic progress and human
bet termient.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF:
Hon.

Mr-. CAL.DER:

Quite right.
On thbe other bond

it ,.bould bc borne in mind that witbin a few

y-ears after the iast war at Ieast tw o other
w'ars broke out-wars cf conquest-one between Grecce and Turkey and the otber
between Poiand and Russia. Wbe(n vou consider the conditions that exist in Europe today and what tbe possible peace terms se, far
as boundaries are concerned[ wil1 be after this
war is cnded, there is always the possibility
of more disturbance in Europe. The existence
of the Council at that stage and for the next
few vears wili be very important. I agree that
for fty years there is no possibility of another
struggle sucb as we bave just gone througli.
This Secuirity Couincil will seek te prevent
wars anywhere in the world, big or smnall, and
1 think that is very (lesirable.
Hon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: I agree with my
bionourable friend. I was directing my remarks
te the possibility of a worid war in, the immedite future. It seems te me tiiat tbe Sccnrity
Counecil will ho sufflciently strong te deal with
anv rcgional wars.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask one further
question? Assuminýg that the Security Council
deal with a matter, and the time cornes wimen
miiitary force must be applied, is a deciaration
of war necessary? Will their action start the
macbinery of war and wili the necessary force
be applied? I weuld think se, se far as the
matter bas been explained up te this point.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 am sure that is a
question I would net venture te answer. It is
lion. Mr. HUGESSEN.

a legal question as te, whether a state of war
bias been created or net.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
I would think that
once the nations agree te establish a Security
Council and give it authority te, apply force,
the Couincil would have the right te apply that
force without a declaration of war bècause, te
tbat extent. tbe naition.s bave given up their
sovereignty. 1 would doubt very much if a
declaration of war would be neressary..
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Might I interject for a
moment to, say te my honourabie friend, who
is rather pessimistie, why werry about that

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

I am net werry-ing.

Hon. Mr. DUFE: Neither arn I. I say let
these .people go te San Francisco and see what
is geing on andi corne back and, report te, us.
Why worry about what is geing te happen tee
or fifteen years frorn now?
Hon. W. M. AiSELTINE: Because we cannet change the report when it cernes back; we
have te adopt it or we do net become a rnember of the league.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Very weil, we wili stay
ont.side andi hoe ocr own row.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
Why net understand it before 0cr delegates go.
Hon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: I arn glad te have
started an intelligent discussion between honcurable scoators on this mest important point.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: You are doing ail
right.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
I was about te
remark-and I have net very rancb more te,
say-that the Economie and, Social Counicil
will be an integral part of the new international
machinery; and I think it will probably ha far
more important for Canada te, be a member of
the Economie andi Social Counicil than te, be a
member cf the Security Council. I believe that
Canada will have a very important part te
play in the Economie and Social Council and
in the various tributary bodies. It is hy this
means and, through these instruments whicb
are offereti to the nations in the proposals te
tse submitted at the San Francisco ceniference
that our country will ha able te assume its fui]
share in the colossal task that, faces 0cr
generation, the task of rebuilding a shittered
bumanity.
Ilonourable senaters, I have corne alrnest te
the end of my long and, I fear, somewhat discursive remarks. If I were te follow the preretient establisliet over the last twenty-five
vears in tbe League of Nations, I sheulti terminate with a peroration on the beauty of

MARJCH 29, 1945
perpetual peace. I propose, however, to resist
that temptation. It seems Vto that in those
me
d-ays we had too many peroraitions and too
littie performance.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: To-day the time
has corne for action. I will conclude by repeating the remaTks of the honourable leader on
the other side at the termination of bis
eioquent speech yesterd-ay afternoon, when he
referred to t.he members of the Canadian, delegation Vo the San Francisco conference, and
partîcularly Vo th-ose who, will go frorn this
honourable Chamber. They carry with thern
not only our best wishes, but our hearts as
'weli. They have a great task an-d a great
opportunity, and, in the words of rny honourable friend the leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Baliantyne), we wish them Qed speed.
Hon. Mr. DTYFF: Hear, he&r.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I want to congratulate the honourable senator
who has just taken h.is seat (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) on bis very able and instructive
speech.
It has rerneved certain questions
that were in the minds of some of us. Generaliy, alrnost entirely, I arn in agreement with
him. H1e pretty well expreýsed my views,
except when lie forecast the end of ail wars.
I arn not as hopeful as lie is. War has not
changed humanity very rnuch, and if we May
judge from what has happened in the past
it bas net bettered humanîty very much.
-Nations after ail are but collections of individutals, and I fear that foiiowinýg thjs wir, es
foiiowing the iast, our troubles wili be many
and grievous, and we shall have tbreats of
war and probabiy war itseif unless we have
sorne sucli erganization as is now proposed to
maintain international peace and security. I
rernember that when I carne back frorn the last
war we were toid there wouid be peace for
ever. At that tirne I addressed the Canadian

Club a-t Calgary. I said ühen that war
was inevitable because there was no agency to
prevent it. and I was criticized severely because, as yon know, at that time everyone
was optimistie and fully helieved there would
neyer be another war. Weil, I arn just as
certain now as I was then that we shah bhave

wars in the future unless we fermr an organiza%tion to stop wars.
To rne, the proposais to be considered at
the San Francisco conference are very eneeuraging. I did not anticipate that such
progress could be rnade in the direction of
wvorld peace hefore this war bad been brought
to a termination. I think the proposed organizatien is our only chance to avoid future
wars.

Its effectiveness depends of course on

49

power; but that is the realistie way of deaiing

with war. I would be content if the maintenance of peace were ieft Vo the thrce powers,
Russia, Great Britain and the United StatesHon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: -because they have
heen active participants in this war, they have
unrivaIied rniiitary, naval and econornic
strength, and if one of thern withdraws from
the organization our peace effort ends.
It seems Vo me we are ahI talking too hopefuliy about the Chinese situation. China will
neot beceme a nation for another century-at
ieast not a dernocratie nation. The Chinaman
has no conception of nationality at ail. His
life centres first in lis family, then in his

cornrunity; beyond that the average Chinaman bas no interest in the so-calied National
Governrnent

of lus country.

True, certain

factions function as governrnent, but anything
like a national dernocratie governrnent in
China wiii be a deveioprnent of the future, for

the Chinese change slowly. However, 1 arn net
very rnuch concerned on that account.

I fear

we shahl have trouble with France, if we rnny
judge from the experience of the fifteen or
twýenty years foliowing the lasV war. But seo
long as Great Britain, the United States and
Russia stick together they bave ample power
Vo ensure the peace of the world.
Hon. Mr. DUFE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: 1 arn very hopeful of
their ability to prevent aggression. I wouid
sav te those who ohject te one clause or
anether of these proposaIs that they bave been
werked eut by men famiiiar witb worid conditions and should receive our favourable
consideratiein. CertÀinly we have to take
a chance with thern; we have ne alternative.

Some people

would have

one subject

or

another injected into these proposais. I arn
prepared te take thern as they stand. No
deuht the conference wvill make sorne arnendmente, but not su-cl as wiii change maiterially

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
29, the consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Honourable Mr.
Vaillancourt for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak I want to express my thanks
to the mover and the seconder of the motion
for the great pleasure they afforded me by
their addresses some days ago. They struck
a very high plane, one that gives promise
that they will perform very useful setvice in
the Senate of Canada.
The subi ect to which I wish to direct your
attention to-night is post-war employment. I
had intended to bring this subi ect up for a
general discussion by way of notice; but as
the shortness of'the session made that ixmpracticable, I would ask you to bear with me whlle
I review the situation, before us as I see it.
There is no question that Germany is approaching the end, and that within three
months at most will be completely crushed.
Then post-war employment will bu the outstanding issue before the country; in fact,
it is now on - our doorstep; and I would
eypect that by the time the next Parliament
convenes it will be in our midst. Maybe,
it is regrettable that we have nlot made further progress. True, both Huses of Parliament have put in a great deal of time considering the question and have given it extensive publicity, but so far as I can see flot
a great deal of what is contained in their
reports has been brought down to the point
where action eau bu taken as soon. as the
opportunity arises. I arn therefore fearful
tliat we shall find these probleuis before us to
he deait with hy the next Parliament.
Now, as to the national responsibilities
whîch post-war employment involves, may
I refer to the memzbers of our armed~ forces
many of whom wil-l have to find new occupations when theýy return to, civilian life.
We have at the present time a total of roughly
3,000,000 men and, women engaged in war
services and directly or indirectly, in war production industries. That is about a third of
our population. Fortunately adi of these persons will flot bu on our hands at one time. The
continuation of the w-ar against Japan and
the forces of occupation in Europe will doubtless absorh a considerable nurnber of our army
personnel; also some of our war plants

will revert ta peacetime production without
any serious interruption. But it, is not too
much for us to expect that within the next
year a million of our men and women will
have ta, change their occupations, since naturaîîy once Germany is dýefeated our production of war materials will be greatly reduced
and the major portion of aur armed forces
will be disbanded.
The committees set up in both Houses to
deal with this subjeet have done a lot of usefuI work, but I sometimes feel that their
approach to it has been too alitruistie and not
sufficiently realistic. I have reference to the
billion dollars which it was estimated would
be required to implement certain measures
of social security. That expenditure would be
based on an eight billion national production,
of which one--eighth or twelve and a haîf per
cent would be required for social security.
1 shaîl endeavour to point out just how
impracticable this idea is, but for the
moment I want to mention another little sum
of $200,000,000 annually that Parliament voted
for family allowances. I arn opposed to the
family allowance, as it is set up on several
grounds. First, it interferes .with the independence of the family. Sîmilar experiments
have been tried before, and they have sel-dom
proved successful in~individual cases. I think
we are assuming quite a responsibility when
we try to m-ake partial provision for the
raising of families. At any rate, the family
allowance interferes with and undermines the
ideals of the average man who is proud of his
ahility to bring up and educate bis family on
his orwn initiative. Furthermore, it encourages
the idea, already too prevalent arnong certain
people in our country, that they can to a
certain extent live off the Government. Too
many people in Canada thin-k the Government owes themi a living, and this so-called
social security goes quite a way towards convincing them that they are right. I believe
that the average Canadian wan.ts a good job
at pay which will enable him to raise his
family to his own liking, and to have the
satisfaction of doing it all by himselýf. Rie
wants to be independent, to be lord and
master of his own home. I agree tjhat we
should provide employrnent for eve¶y warthy
Canadian who wants to work; th-at is bis due;
but I oppose the idea of this family subsidy
which, should we fail to provide employment,
would be nothing more than a dole. I amn confident that most honourable senators will agree
with me that we do not want doles of any
kind.
Our pre-war production was four and a
haîf billions, of which roughly one billion was

52

SENATE

exported. The present national production is
eight billion dollars, half of which, or four
billion dollars, is exported. After the war if
we are to maintain a national production of
anything like eight billion dollars, even if we
allow half a billion dollars for increased consumption by our own people under good
working conditions, we shall still have to export
four billion dollars, or four times what we
exported before the war. I am free to say
that I do not sec how that can be accomplished. It does seem to me as though the
people who are juggling with these tremendous figures must expect national revenue to
fall on us like a Christmas snow storm.
It is far beyond my powers to comprehend
how, under the trying circumstances in the
world to-day, we can expeet to maintain anything like our present national production. At
present, operating as we do, we have no marketing problems. That four billion dollars
represents munitions and supplies, war equipment and, I presume, the money we give away,
roughly one billion dollars a year. But we
cannot continue that in peace time. Those
figures are all right as war appropriations, but
we will have a different set of rules to go by
once we return to peace. Our endeavours to
maintain exports will not be unopposed. It
is evident in what we read in the press that
the United States and other countries as well
are making tremendous efforts to increase
their external trade. For a time, while Europe
is being supplied with food and other requisites, a certain part of our production will be
required, but I do not think that will be for
long. We have been warned by Britain that
we must not expect her to buy as much
from us as she bought in preýwar years,
unless we can balance the account. That is
rather reasonable.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: And Mr. Churchill has
told Britain that to let up on lier agricultural

production would be a calamity. That of
course means that Britain will huiv less wheat
and other farin produicts fromn us. I was
somewliat surprised to note in the press a few
days. ago that a menber of the Belgian Gov«rinent said in Montreal that his country
would be back in the British market within
a few ionths. That seeis hardl1 possible. I
was also surprised to read official reports
showing that the dairy cattle production of
France is now seventy-five per cent of what it
vas at the outbreak of the war.
Europe is not going to require from us
anything like as much produce as we thought
she would before she becomes re-established.
I notice that recently Britain made a treaty
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

with Sweden-I presume a very favourable
one, because Sweden has not been in the war
and therefore has no war burdens; if anything,
she has made money out of the war. That
brings to my mind a suggestion that if we are
to have an equitable readjustment of things
after the war, countries such as Sweden and
the Argentine and all others that grew rich
on our fight for civilization should be obliged
to pay an import tax to United Nations
countries as a means of sharing tp some degree
in the expense incurred to maintain their
civilization. As I see it, I am afraid that,
notwithstanding all the statements to the
contrary, the drift after the war will be
towards self-sufficiency on the part of the
nations, each endeavouring to live as closely
as possible within the limits of its own production so as to reduce its purchases abroad.
That situation will of course be due to the
scarcity of credit. In that regard there is
much promise in the international banking
arrangement which has been discussed, and
which is the only way by which credit can be
safely extended to these various countries with
the bope of getting payment for the goods
purchased. Much will depend on this international banking arrangement when it is
worked out. Now, with regard to employment
after the war, the provincial, federal and
municipal governments are carrying on a very
commendable planned effort to provide emTo a considerable extent that
ployment.
would be immediate employment. Through
that effort we might hope to bridge the gap
that will occur between wartime activities and
the re-establishment of industry on a peacetime basis. That, honourable senators, I submit is a very temporary effort, and any
volume, great as it may be, will repiesent but
a very small part of what the industries of this
country can be expected to and should produce. At best it is only a stop-gap.
That leads me to the question of the
situation with respect to our present tax
system. In this regard I have nothing but
tax
effort
Canada's
for
co mmendation
during the war. We have accomplished wonWe have raised half of our total
ders.
expenditures by taxes, and the other half we
have borrowed from our fellow citizens. But,
as I have said, that was under war conditions.
There was no marketing problem in connection
with any of our production, and in war time,
on account of the scarcity of manpower, we
did not permit expansion of any industry; on
the contrary, we tried to keep private business
down to the very minimum so that money
would be available for war loans and personnel
for the war effort. That was correct. We have
donc well. But, honourable senators. I submit
that there is as much difference between war

APRIL 4, 1945
effort and post-war effort as there is between
day and night.
Sorne lion. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Successful activities in
war-time, if continued on into tihe peace will
be our ruination. I arn going ta refer to
some of the taxes as they affect our corporations, and for the record I wish to say that I
arn neither a director of for a shareholder in
any of aur leading industries, and only wish
to express my unbiased views ta honourable
senators for what they are worth.' At the
present tirne, as honourable senators well
know, the tax on corporations is forty per
cent. In addition, there is an Excess Profits
Tax whîch, including the 20 per cent credit,
accounts for ail the excess profit. Then, when
dividends are declared the shareholder pays
his incarne t, in ail as higli taxation as any
country in the world. I arn not looking for
much reduction in our incorne taxes, but I say
that it is gaing to be essential to make reductions if we are going to get business going
again. Sorne companies have been severely
handicapped by the present systern of taxation as other interests throughout the country
have been owing to the war. There are a
great many campanies, particularly those on
standard profits, which have not been in a
position to accumulate anything to enable
them to make the transition front war ta
peace.
These companies should be given
sorne consideration. The rnain point, however,
is such reduction of the corporation and excess
profits taxes as will enable thern ta produce
with sarne hope of profit. That is particularly
true if we are looking for an increase in aur
industrial efforts. That is what irnproved
national production really rneans. As I see it,
the present tax systern is a stone wall in the
path af the establishmnent of new industries
and the successful operation of rnany established industries.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: We won't get started
as things are to-day. Sornethîng definite bas
gat ta be done for aur corporations so that
they can successfully revert ta peace-tirne
production. The Governrnent should give
aur corporations sorne definite assurance* as
ta what they will have ta rneet ini taxation in
the post-war period sa that they can make
their arrangements accordingly. As it is,
practically ail industries are following a po!icy
of wait and see. I think that will be tihe situation nationally until the Goverument takes
some definite action in the rnatter, and that
of course wiil be for the new Parliament. 1
know that the reduction of taxes at this tirne
is a very difficult matter. It is obvious that

5

we wili have ta borrow money after the war
if we are ta take care of aur responsibilities
and meet 'the situation. It is dificuit ta
reduce taxes in the face of this; nevertheless
we mnust reduce taxes, even if we borrow
more money. And that is the answer. We
will have ta mortgage the future ta an even
greater extent than we have already done
in order that our industries rnay get going
and furnish the ernployment 'we hope for.
That is going ta require a lot of courage,
a definite decision, and sorne risk; but we
are in the position naw where we have gat
ta do it. We have got ta take aur courage in
our hands; we have got ta consider the situation and do what we think is best. As I have
said, that issue is right on aur doorstep. It
will have ta be deait with when the new
Parliarnent convenes.
There are anc or two projeets that offer considerable ernployaient, and which also demand
aur prompt attention. I have in mind aur
place in thse world of air development. There
is no doubt that great advances will be made
in the next few years, and we are particularly
equipped ta take a leading position in this air
transportation. As a resuit of the war long
distances have been tra.velled and safety of
travel has been irnproved. This is gaing ta
resuit in great civil air dcvelopments in the
future. If you have any douýbt about that,
note the strugg-le which the American and
Britishs campanies, and possi.bly some athers,
are making for a place in the air. We have as
mucli daim ta a premier position in the air
service as any other country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: And we shauid lose no
time in asserting aur claim. I trust thse Gavernment will give this matter its early consideratian, because otherwise I arn afraid we
shall be overlooked. The developmenit of air
transport would give almost immediate ernployment to prabably twenty thousand of aur
returned airmen, and over a period of tirne ta
many mare.
The hanourable senatar frarn Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) spake very feelingly on what
we were going ta do with aur airnsen who were
returning-all young men, on thse average
about twenty-five years of age or Iess, who
have corne out of aur universities and know
no other occupation than flying an aeroplane.
But that occupation they knaw weil. They
have been weil educated in it. It bas cost us
probably $10,000 each ta educate these boys.
We should not throw that education away.
Coupled with the general developinent of aviation there is also the development in aur own
country, particulariy in aur north country

SENATE

where the bush pilots have in the past blazed
the trail. Such a service, if properly developed. will take another ten or twenity thousand
of our men. I know the Governent bias been
hesitant about adopting a policy in that regard.
I ain told that soime returned airmen bave
alr-eïdv devised a plan te eperate a company

and pay for t he shares with thieir own rooney.
Thcy want the right te fly in certain districts,

It is diffleuit, hlonourable senators. te everestiroate the dcx clopinient that xviii coe

flot result. This is particularly true when you
get out to what is known as the barrens.
In this connection 1 may say that honourable members will find the maps prepared by
aur Department of Mines are very interesting.
They clearly show the faults, and the quartz
outcroppings appear almoat as plainly as
though you were on the ground itself. The
Department of Mines bas long been an excellent department, and in this as in other
respects it bas dane an excellent job. Its
maps aid greatly in the development which
is now about ta, corne through. People in the
United States are laoking ta Canada for
investment, largely in aur mining develapments. Millions of dollars will be învested
here if there is gaod hope of prdfit. In that
regard we had a very gaod mining iaw before
the war, and it is only necessary now ta continue it after the war. That, with the tax
readjustment which I have described, would
almost spontaneausly bring about developments much mare rapidly than any we have
ever had, because the situation in aur north
country is becoming much better understoad,
and mineraI discoveries are more general,
particularly of the outstanding mineral--gold.
Men who ought ta know prcdict that in the
Yeliow Knife district, wbich takes in a wide
range, the development might even rival the
Rand. Certainly gold deposits are found over
a far-flung area, and there is every reason ta
expect that in the next few years new develapments wili add greatiy to, the gald production
of this country. I laok forward ta the day,
nat so, very far ahead, when wîth an aggressive
policy we shaîl be producing $500,000,000
worth of gold a year. Gold is subject ta no
market fluctuations. Some of you may have
had doubt about its value when the United
States had nearly $30,000,000aOW worth of gold
stored in Kentucky. But what bas becomne of
that gold? A large quantity of it bas gone
ta or been ear-marked for South America, a
billion and a haif w-ill go back ta France, and
so it gaes. Reduction of the stored gold has
procecded at quch a rate that last month the
United States Government did not have
enough gold in Kentucky ta, caver its currency
issue at forty per cent, and therefore reduced
the coverage ta 25 per cent. I think those
wba*were uneasv about the reai value af gold
can rest easy. It is the anly commodity in
the settiement of international balances.
Han. Mr. HOWARD: It may help ta pay
aur family aIlowances.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: It surely would. In
fact, gold is a magie metal, and it is really
worth more than it's actual value. But for
the present Jet us leave the magic aide of it
out of consideratian and deal with the production itself. Honourable members from

55

Qucbec who have seen the new gold fields
developed do not need to be told what these

mean ta a province. In addition ta the
miners who are working underground, there
are on the surface ail the people required ta
operate the stores, garages, haspitais and
aIl other facilities of a modern settiement. I
bave not exact figures,

but I believe

that

for every miner who works underground there
are two or threc persans empioyed in the community on the surface, people who are nat
associated with the mine itself. That brings
ta mind a suggestion. We have been talking
about plans for financing aur rctu.rned boys
for a start in the aider communities, but it
seems to me that many of themn would have
a much better chance ta mnake good in new
districts where they could blaze their awn way
and get on their feet sooner. Some idea, of
the treniendous employment that can corne
from mining is shown by the fact that in 1943
there were 325,000 miners in South Africa;
and it is probable that the number of persans who were given indirect empioyrnent on
the surface wouid be 600,000 or 700,000. You
cannot measure mining employment in terras
of the men in the mines; you have ta include

ail the auxiiiary services.
1 want to 6ay another word about goid,
because I like it and 1 feel I know a littie
about it. It seems ta me the Canadian mind
should be disabused of the idea that the price
of gold is not cantroIied. Compiaint bas beea
made because of the rise in price from $22
tû $35; but the fact is that the price ta-day
is very much controlied. General Smuts is
reported as saying he dîd nat care whether
Britain took Sohth -Africa's gold or nat, for
he could always gell it. The fact is that about
a year ago goid was selling in India for
approximatcly $70 an ounce. and the price in
Egypt was roughiy the same. At the last
monthly auction sale reported from Chule gald
sold for $59 an ounce in United States funds.
If gold is not a controlled caznmodity, 1 do
flot know one that is.

If we produce $5W0,000,000 worth of gold a

year in this country, at least ninety per cent
of it wiii be paid out for labour, maehinery,
and supplies, inciuding products of our farmas
and factories. In other words. that portion of
il. wilI be distributed ta the praducers of Canada. And, as I said earlier, there is no trouble
in marketing gold. Our. mining iaw is good,
and we do not need ta do any more than get
things going again and adjust the tax probiem.
The great need is a revision of taxation ta a
peace time busis. Wartime taxes are ail right
in war, but they are insurmauntable barriers,
ta new industries, to mining and other effarts
ta incease production in peace time.
The Address was adopted.

APRIL 4, 1945
No nation can immunize itself bereafter against
these disasters by reliance 14pon itself alone.
The misaPplied slogans of ye,ýterday are mere
booby traps in the presence of these hard
realities. I have no shadow of a douht that
American self-interest requires our co-operation
to meet this terror before it tiares up again.
I arn not suggesting the dissipation of our
essential sovereignty .in. eltecting this cooperation. I arn not ioinrng in any movement
to submerge our independence in a world state.
I arn talking about co-operation between nations
whieh retain their essential sovereignty. But
one of the attributes of savereignty is to
relinquisb voluntarily wbatever segments can be
traded for something more valuable to us. That
is ail we shall be asked to do if international
peace co-operation is launchied on the right
basis.
I will not dwell any longer on that phase
of the discussion. It was very ably covered
in the splendid~ acidress made a few days ago
by tbe honourable senator froni Inkerman.
Will the Ho.use allow me a few moments
to analyse part of the resolution and the

proposals recited in the pamphlet that has
been distributed to bonourable senators? In
the preamble of the motion it is said that
Canada is invited to the San Francisco Conference by the Goverrnnexit of the United,
States of kmeric.a, on bebalf of itself and oif
tire United Kingdom of Great Britain and

Northern Ireland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republies and the Republic of China;
and in Chapter II o-f the proposais, it is
provided tbat:
The organization is based on the principie
of the sovereign equaiity of ail peace-ioving

states..

This is the cuimination of the steps- wbicb

have led Canada from tbé state oif a vanquisbed coiony to that of a sovereign nation,
and is wortby of note by thýose who claini
tbat

we are

stili colonial

puppets

at the

beck and caîl of England. It is the finest
tribute to the greatness of Britisb institutions.
As bas been stated, elsewhere and. bere Canada's status as a nation bas not weakened
tbe link between this country and the other
nations of the Commonwealth and the Mother
Country.
On the contrary that link bhs
been st.rengtbened because it is forged by a
common aliegiance to our King, and by

common ideais of civilization, of liberty and
of de.nocratic institutions.
There is another fact wortby of mention.
The Security Council, as stated in *Section A
of Chapter VI, will be composed of eleven
members, five of which, namely, the United
States of Anierica, the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and. Nortbern Ireland, the
Union of Soviet Socialîst Republics, the Republic of Cbina, aixL in due course, France,
saal have permanent seats.

57

Wbat a difference one year bas brought:
In Bill 84 of last session, an Act for carrying
into effect the agreement for United Nations
relief and rehabilitation administration between
Canada and certain other nations and authorities, Article III, Section 3, says:
Tbe Central Comnmittee of the Council shall
consist of the representativs of China, the
UTnion of Soviet Socialist IReliibics, the United
Ký-iugdnrn, and the United States of America,
xvitb tbe Director Generai presiding without
vote.
There is no mention of France. But to-d-ay
we read that in due course France will bave
a permanent seat on the Security Council.
That great coun.try wbicb bas known tbe
borrors of moral and physical slavery has
recovered ber liberty and will take ber rigbt-

fuI place among tbe Great Powers of tbe
world. To me it is a miracle tbat this recovery, this liberty, bas been tbe restait of tbe
perseverance and beroism of France's onetime enemy, England. Wbhat a lesson there
is ini tbis for us in Canada, wbo are tbe
descendants of tbese two great nations.

It bas been feared tbat by agreeing to
accept tbe decisions of the Security Council
Canada migbt sacrifice some of ber sovereîgnty.
Even if this were true, why would not Canada
accept what forty other nations are willing
to accept in a worthy cause? I entertain no
fear of tbe result.
Tbe same principle that governs individuals also go'verns nations. A man by
entering into. a partnersbip, agreement witb
other individ-uals does not abandon bis liberty;
be simply makes use of bis liberty to coordinate certain of bis efforts witb tbose of bis
partners, tbereby increasing bis capacity for
action. Tbe sanie is true of a nation. Even a
great power like tbe United States of America
cannot stand alone to-day. By freely and
willingly joining witb otber powers for a
common cause a nation increases its ability
to carry undertakings to success, especially if
tbese undertakdngs are for the purpose of
ensuring world peace.
In bis address the other day, tbe bonourable
senator for Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugesson)
clearly demonstrated the reasons for tbe failure
of tbe League of Nations to justify its existence. Sueb a body needs not only the
autbority to judge, but the power to enforce
decisions. Experience of the last twenty-five

years bas sbown wbat was lacking in the
League of Nations. We will not fail into the
sanie errors again. There sbould be no fear
on that score.
And now I corne to the great controversial
issue of commitments. What wiil be the
commitments of Canada? Let us study for a

SENATE

58

fow moments the different stages of the proceedings lcading te commitments. Section 4
of the motion says:
That this House agrees' thât the representatives of Canada at the confcreîîcc sbûîîld lise
their hest endeavonui s te firither the îîrcîaratîeîl
nf an acceptable charter for an internîational
îîrganization for the maintenance of international peace andi security.
I ask henourable membors te note the
woî'd "acceptable." It is important, it is ossential.
Thon Section 5:
That the charter cstablisbiiig tlie internîationîal organizatiîiî shîuhld, before ratification,
bo sîibîoitted te Parliament for appreval.
This moans that the charter will have te ho
approved by our Parliamont.
Bot there is more. Lot us sec what are tlic
cnmmitments. In section 2 of chapter II, we

will gladly pay the premium for poace insurance. Let us romembor the old roman proccpt: "Si vis pacom, para bchlum".

APRIL 4, 1945
I need merely mention in passing, the benefils which will accrue to Canada from the
activities of the Social Council, for they are
obvious to us ail.
Care, however, should be taken that we do
flot undertake the carrying out of reforms
which are not within the jurisdiction. of
Pairl jament.
In another place, the Prime Minister made
an appeal to corne membere to make unanimous the decision to send delegates to the
San Francisco meeting. I arn satisfled that
there will be no occasion to make such, an
appeal to this honourable assembly.
Some Hon. SENATORS:- Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: But there is an
appeal to be made to some of our fellow
citizens. We love peace. We have given
proof of it by living in harmony with our
neighbours for over a century. But unhappily
we lack unity in our own country. Differences
exist, but really tbey are only superficial and
would disappear in an atmosphere of good will.
Let us therefore follow the precepts of the
old Chineise philosopher whom I cited corne
time ago. Let us study and find the causes ni
our troubles, shed prejudices, remedy injustices--if there be any-and since we are
willing to join other nations to promote peace
in the world, let us unite wîth our brother
citizens to preserve peace in our Canadian
family.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. MeL. ROBERTSON: I arn sure,
honeurable senators, that to anyone who has
been, privileged to heur the very excellent
addresses wbichi have heen made in this
Chamber on this resolution-to whieh those
of the honourable senators from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte) and from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) are no exception-it must be a
matter for regret that this House does flot
in the circumstances h-ave the opportunity of
exercising a greater influence upon the thought
of Canada in particular and of the world at
large in general.
No greater opportunity could corne to us
than to exercise our ability to think clearly
and objectiveIy with respect to the problems
implicit in this resolution and the other great
problems that will face this country in the
momentous days that lie ahead. Mfter aIl,
every one of us wants security and prosperity
for Canada, and I make no excuse for mentioning both together because I believe they are
indivisible and must be given, careful thought
as far as our future plans are concerned. It je
well that we give to our delegates who may go
to the conference at San Francisco and to
other international conferences the benefit of
our ideas.

59

Some very excellent views have been cxpressed in the course of th.is debate. I was
particularly impressed by one remark in the
very excellent address of the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
which we listened to with so much pleasure
a few days ago. Referring to the question of
Canada's seat, or lack of it, on the Security
Council, he said that the Assembly and the
committees arieing out of it, provided for in
these proposais, might well be even more
important in future than the Security Council
itself. I regard the Security Council as
being the policeman of the future as far as
world affaire are concerned. It will be the
responsibility and duty of those who comprise
the Assembly to rebuild this world so that the
desire for war will have passed, when the work
of the policeman would be of a very limited
nature. This beîng so, I can offer no further
suggestions to those already made in regard to
the Security Council. I should like however,
to suggest to the delegates who will represent
us et San Francisco, that we in this House
should give them the benefit of our views with
respect to the questions whîch may arise in
the Assem'bly or in the committees to be set
up by the Assembly. It is quite poýssible that
in the time at their disposaI the delegates will
only be able to set up the necessary framework
to consider these particular matters. The
.Committee on Economie and Social Aff aire is
of sucb vital importance to us that I think
our representatives sbould lose no opportunity
of discussing the removal of the barriers to
international trade, whether the opportunity
arises in the faeshioning of the framework for
the consideration of that question in the future
'or in conversation with individual members,
because I believe from the bottora of my
heart that the future peace and prosperity of
-theworld depends upon such removal and that
it would have the most vital effect upon the
'whole future trend of mankind.
Sonne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If that be so, and
I think it is generally recognized, it is particularly desirable that our delegates ehould
be dynamic and aggressive and positive in
respect te the matter, because, as the honourable eenator from Vancouver pointed out,
there are very great objections and obstacles
in the way.
The question is an important one, honourable senators, because our economy depende
to such a large extent on international trade.
In the three years before the war less than
seven per cent of the production of the
United States was exported. Even the United
Kingdom, which is looked upon always as one
of the greatest trading nations, exported only

60

SENATE

about twenty per cent of ber production.
But in those samne years we in Canada exported
about thirt-five per cent of our total production. That being the case, one of the
absolute necessities for the solution of the
problems that will face us in the future, is that
conditions in respect to international trade in
post-war years should be at least as favourable as they were before the xvar, because,
as was pointed out by the bionourable senators
from Vancouv-er (Hon. Mr. McRae). Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson), in the intererncing period
the productive capacities of this country have
inecased trcemendously.
The increase is staggering. The impact cf
two great wars seems in each case to have
resulted in a tremendous development of our
productive capacities-which shows the wealth
of our niatural resources and the adaptability
of our people. In 1939 there were 6t3S.000
people employed in maoufacturing. In 1944
the number had risen te more than a million
and a quarter-an iccrease of upwards of
600,000, despite the fact that there were
800,000 men in the armed forces. In the same
period the mont.bly payroll bad gene up from
$14,000,000 to $40,000,000.
Gross production
hiad incrcased from tbnee and a half billion
dollars te more than eight billion dollars.
Concurrently with that industrial expansion
there has been a tremendous increase in agricultural and other primary production.
If therefore we are to pýrex cnt a terrifie

resources--the honourable senator fromr Vancouver referred to tbem in one particularoccupied by a trifiing eleven and a biaîf million
people. Ccntrast the sparse population îspread
over this vast area witb the terrifie congestion
10other parts cf the world. It is inevitable
tbat, ocless there is a very substantial increase in our population, the people in those
ovcercw<l(d contrics will cast envicus eyes
towards Canada.
Ex ery national interest dictates that arrangements between nations sbould make
pcssible oct only' a contionance cf bunt a ver'v
grcat increase i0 thc volume of international
trade in the future. In tbis connection the
honourable scoator frcm Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) made wbat 1 consider a most startliog remark. He wondered xvbctber this matter wculd be disco...-.d at the San Franci co
conference. and referred to the fact that in
[lie Company of himself aod some other
txventv respcnsible persons, two noted Canadian concmists hiad said tbat Canada would
face a very' serious situation if Great Britain,
as a result cf the aboormal conditions that
lîad arisen élîring the wvar, sbould confine ber
trading te tbe sterling bloc, meaning that we
coulel ot expect bier te purchase from us aovýthing like xx
bat sbc bjad purcbased in the
past.
And tbev suîggcsted that tbis miight
result in a condition in which, as tbe boncurable gentleman saidý, "The people cf Caunada would bave to bccome reconciled te continued taxation at tbc prescrit bigli rates,
l)ecause it wotitd be oecessar v cubler te subsidize tbe tbrce Prairie Provioces or te liquidate tbem and move titeir people te otber
parts cf the country."
Honourable senatcrs, tbe fact that since the
war or farilities fer international trade not
on]'v biave fot been improved but bave heen
very muiCît lessened, is a mcst important matter, and one witli regard te wbicb I tbiok the
influence of ori delegates sbould be exercised
te the utmost cf their ability. In 1937, for
instance. Great Britain purchiased from us
lmcre than 3~400,000,000 cf goods and we purcbased froin bier about $147,tXt0,000. If in selfdefenCe or tbirougli abnormal cirvuinst-inces sIte
hiad te Confine bier tradinu, activit:eýý for a
considerable pericd cf time large lv to tbe
sterling bloc. that iniigb t bring aboii a xery
sermons condition for Canadai.
Tbis woîîld tremcndoosly upset our whele
eeooomv, even on a pre-war basis, and honcurable senators con imagine what effeet it
xvould have under preseoit circumstances.
The London Times cf 'March 9 had a most
interesting refereoce te Great Britain*s recent
financial agreemneot with Sweden, wbicb was
mentioned by the bonourable gentleman from

APRIL 4, 1945
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae). Apparently
the great difficulties that Britain is facing arise
from the huge quantity of sterling that is
outstanding and her announced intention and
desire to confine her trade in future as far as
possible within the sterling bloc. The agreement with Sweden provides that the rate of
exchange between sterling and kronor is to be
established, and both countries agree to keep
any surplus receipts of the other's currency
without limit. As the London Times editorial puts it:
The United Kingdom will accept and keep
kronor, and Sweden will accept and keep
sterling.
The closing paragraph of the editorial says
this:
It is hard to say whether the idea of the
world trade in terms of universally convertible
currencies will become attainable or not, during
the early years after the war. But it is almost
certain, in view of the disorganization

which

exists at present, that no universal system can
be built at all unless it is first prefabricated
in sections.

I take it., honourable senators, that however desirable may be the ideal of a marked
lowering of the barriers to the flow of international trade, it is inevitable that in the
immediate post-war period there will arise
sections-to use the London Times' termfor trading purposes, which sections will be as
large as circumstances may make possible,
and that the greatest effort will be made to
remove obstacles to the flow of international
trade within those sections. That is to say,
trading between countries within the sections
is likely to be on a much more favourable
basis than between any of those countries
and others outside the section. Therefore I
suggest to the delegates who represent us at
San Francisco that we want to make sure of
getting into a section, and that that section
should be the largest one possible.
I want to suggest, moreover, that inasmuch
as we cannot contemplate a situation wherein
our security will not involve the closest possible co-operation with those countries which,
as we have learned from history and the
experience of two wars, think as we think and
act as we act, the section of international
trade of which we become a part should
include as a very minimum the United Kingdom and the United States.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Needless to say,
we would hope to have it immediately
enlarged by the inclusion of countries that
revolve in the orbit of those nations or are
most closely associated with them. The
important point is that since eighty-five per
cent of our external trade in pre-war days

61

was done with Great Britain and other parts
of the Empire and the United States, we
should use every possible influence to have
Canada become part of a trading section
which includes these countries. If that kind
of arrangement cannot be made with countries such as Great Britain and the United
States, whose living conditions and ideals are
so similar to ours, I ask you, honourable
senators, with what countries could it be
made?
I for one hope that the delegates representing us will use every opportunity that may
arise, whether by way of assisting to fashion
the branch of the international organization
that will deal with world trade, or by way of
personal contacts, to associate us in a trading
section with Great Britain and the United
States. It seems to me that no thinking person can deny the necessity for this, unless we
are prepared to adopt a much lower standard
of living than we now enjoy in this country
and have enejoyed for some years past.
Every part of this country would benefit by
our becoming part of such a trading section.
Imagine the prosperity that would come to
British Columbia, for instance, through our
having preferred access to the markets available to us as a member of the section. And it
does not require any stretch of the imagination to picture how greatly the three prairie
provinces would benefit, for their whole
economic future is wrapped up with the question of international trade. The tremendous
potentialities of these provinces are perhaps
among the outstanding opportunities for
development in the world to-day. Then the
central provinces of Quebec and Ontario, with
their great manufacturing structure, which
would suffer so seriously from any reduction
in trade, would on the other hand certainly
stand to gain enormously from increased
exports to markets within the section. And I
want to say to my honourable friends from
the Maritimes that New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island also would
have everything to gain from our inclusion in
a large trading section. In those provinces we
have had many painful experiences of what it
means to be on the circumference of a selfcontained Canada. We are on the fringe now;
but if we were part of a trading section which
comprised Great Britain, the United States
and other countries, our position would be
moved to the centre. If present predictions
are right, no one from the Maritime provinces
will be a delegate to the San Francisco conference, but I do not hesitate to suggest that
the delegates from Canada should point out
to the United Kingdom representatives that
the location of the Maritime provinces on this

SENATE

62

continent bears a striking similarity te the
location cf the British Isies with respect te the
continent cf Europe, and express the hope
that in its rclnîilding plan Great Britain, which
is traditieually far-sighted, consider meving
some cf its industries tu our Maritime provinces just in case there sheuld be further
trouble in Europe-fer ne one knews what the
future holds.
I scîbmit te henourable senaters that the
happiness, the security and the presperity cf
Canada tuake it imperative that we shoulti
werk fer the clesest possible ecenemîc arrangeînients between us and these peeple with whcnî
we have mest in cemmon; snd te this end
we slîculd become part cf a tradc section
xvhicha includes the United Kingdoîn and the
United States, and afterwxxrds hielp te extenti
it as for and as rapidly as circumstances permit. I believe this is a matter of tîenxendeus
im.portance, and if any suggestions that I have

say ne. and in support cf mx- stand I xvcîld
refer henourahie seuafers te section A cf'

APRIL 5, 1945
Chapter V, which deals with the General
Assembly. It reads as follows:
Composition: Ail members of the Organizatien should be members of the Generai Aýsseînbiy
and shouid have a num-ber of representatives
to be specified in the Charter.
As honourable members wili have noticed,
over the week-end the newspapers published
statements, whether weli-founded or not, to the
effect that the principle, of "one state, one vote"
would flot be adhered to, but that instead
Great Britain, the United States and Soviet
Russia might, each be given several votes.
Later it was deciared, authoritatively or
otherwise, that the United States wouid, flot
take the initiative in asking. for more than
one vote. Whatever may be the practicai
issues on that question., I intend- to discuss
the princiýpies which are invoived and which
will remnain true:, independently of any policy
that may be adopted. 1 have just mentioned
the first principle of the proposais, namaeiy,
the principl-e of the sovereign equai.ity of ahl
peace-loving states. and, 1 wish to remark
at once that teo broad an interpretation
should not be given to that principie or
doctrine.
We ail reaiize .perfectly welil, I
think, that in fact all states are flot equal
to one another. This truth becomes -absoiutely obvious if we look, for instance, at
the map of our western hemisphere.
The
democracies of the new world are unequal
by whatever test we assess and measure thema:
they differ completely in naturai resources,
size, population, industriai and agricultural
production, commercial and financial power,
miiitary strength, standards of living and of
civilization, and so on. If the contemplated
international organizati-on persisted in treating ail states as being perfectly equai, that
rule wouid, I submit, be as unjust as a rule
which wvould give equai voting power to
every shareholder in a company, irrespective
of the number of his shares. That analogy
is cited from a work, entitled "The Le-ague
of Nations," second edition, page 61, by the
weillknown author Pollock. Another authority, Brie!rly, rcferring to the doctrine of
equality, states in "The La;w of Nations,"
s~econd edition, pages 91 and 92, that
is a true theory only if it means that the
rights of one state, whatever they may be,
are as mucli entitled to the protection of iaw
as the rights of any other, that is to say, if
it merely denies that the weakness of a state
is any excuse in i.aw for disregarding its legai
rights. This is the oniy sense in which any
system of iaw can be said -to recognize 1egal
equality; ail Enýglishm.en are equal y entitled
to have their rights upheld by the iaw, but
they do not have equal rights.
A few uines further on Brierly adds that by
giving too wide an interpretation to the theory
of equality the smnal-ler states have proffered:

63

-unreasonabie
dlaims whieh have seriousiy
hampered the improvement of international
organization.
One such incident occurred st
the Hlague Conference in 1907, when the seheme
for an international court of justice, upon
which agreement had been aimost reached, was
wrecked hy the refusai of some of the smaiier
powers tu agree to anything less than equai
representation of every state upon the court.
The doctrine was innocuous so long as there
existed praeticaily no co-operative management
cf affairs of general international interest; if
it is to be used to justify a dlaim by every
state to an equai voice in the further organization of international society, it wili be not
only indefensihie and unjuft in principle, hut
obstructive of prcgress.
In other words, on the basis cf the doctrine
that ail men in the so-caiied "state cf nature"
are equal to one another-a proposition entireiy untrue, according to Brierly, page 90.iurists cf the so-calied "naturalist school" of
international iaw. such as Pufendorf, Vattel
and others, have professed the theory cf equaiity cf states.
But let us remark here that this faise equalitarian doctrine has neyer in fact afforded any
real protection te a weak state; it bas neyer
prevented effectiveiy any act of aggression.
Therefore, while I claire that the rights of the
weakest cf ail the states of the earth are entitled to the full protection cf international
law, with ail the sanctions provided by the new
charter, on the other hand, I arn a firrn believer
in the doctrine which is somnetimes described
as the "functional theory"--the theory cf representation upon a functionai basis.
This
means that duties always correspond to rights;
that the assumptien of heavier responsibilities
in any particular field cf action entities a given
state te a greater veice in the deliberations cf
the international community. In other words
it does net seem fair that ail members cf the
international cemmunity should have equal
veting power irrespective cf their contributions
te the maintenance of justice and order in the
world.
I would refer te the contributions cf nations
in the past and te the part those nations will
probably play in worid affairs as the guardians
cf pqace. In view cf their pat contributions,
it seems quite logicai te grant more than one
vote in the Generai Assemnbly of the United
Nations te first-class powers, such as the
United Kingdem of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States cf America.
Even a secondary or middle power like Canada, as honourabie memnbers know fias made
much greater sacrifices and put forth a much
greater war effort than the -ma.jority cf the
other minor powers, and in fairness te the
Canadian people such a fact shouid in some
way hp recognized.

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, my first words must express my
pleasure and congratulation upon the character
of the debate on this subi ect as it has been
conducted in 'bth Houses of Parliament.
Without exception the contributions from al
quarters have been worth while; but I think
they have been made witb a greater measure
of objectivity in this Ohamber than in the
other. It is most gratifying to observe the
widespread interest of the ýmembers of both
HRouses in this vital subject of international
peace and security.
Some Honý. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I should like partioularly to express iny admiration for the
very lucid and comprehensive exposition of
the different clauses of the charter which the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) presented to us lest week. I must
also express my deep appreciation of the
inspiring report which the bonourable senator
who bas just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Gouin)
has place-d before us in connection witb bis
recent mission to our forces overseas. I arn
sure honourable members will join me in
wishing him God4speed on bis return, knowing
full well that he will acquit birnself with the
ability and wbole-bearted devotion to d'uty
which has cbaracterized his services in this
Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No subject could be
more appropriate for consideration by the
Senate than the resolution before us to-day,
and I trust tbat this debate is just the beginning of many discussions bere on the important question of international affairs. I sbould
like to suggest now that through our Standing
Committee on External Relation-s, which will
be meeting again before long, and tbrougb
further discussions in this Chamber, honourable senators sbould assume somne increased
measure of responsibility for spreading enlightenment on this question amongst the people
of our country.
I wish to emphasize much that the bonourable senator who bas just sat down said about
tbe basis of this country's representation at
San Francisco, and to support his general
attitude with respect to the growing sense
of Canadien nationýality in this Dominion.
In view of uncertainties which bave developed and been reported in the Press during
the past few days, the subject of the San
Francisco conference becomes even more
hypothetical as a besis for discussion than it
was lest week. We bave no alternative, bowever, but to proceeid witb the discussin. In

SENATE

any case, the proposals which are supposed
to be considered at San Francisco, known as
the Dumbarton Oaks plan, represent merely
a draft constitution of an international postwar organization for the preservation of the
world's peace. The beginning of these proposals, it is worth remembering, came in
October, 1943, at the Moscow Conference,
when the representative heads of four great
allied powers declared:
The necessity of establishing at the earliest
practicable date a general international organization based on the principles of the sovereign
equality of all peace-loving states, and open to
menbership by all sueh states, large and small,
for the maintenance of international peace and
security.
I think these words, "based on the principles of the sovereign equality of all peaceioving states, and open to membership by al]
such states, large and small," should be lefinitely underlined for our attention.
When considering the proposed powers of
the principal members of the Security Council. it would be well for us to ponder over the
possible reasons for such a declaration being
made at Moscow in 1943. In my opinion it
was made as an expression of war aims, and
as a steadying influence for all democratie
countries.
Honourable members will recall
that prier to 1943 a considerable body of
opinion was being created in both Great Britain and the United States in support of the
thought that the interests at stake in this war
could net be successfully prosecuted without
a statement of war aims. I believe that when
the heads of the four Great Powers met at
Moscow in 1943 they decided that because a
great many countries would inevitably be
devastated and the whole world would suffer
from economic and financial disruption. the
time had come when it was necessary to make
a concession to the rising tide of opinion to
which I have referred. That declaration was
made the subject of study by the representatives of the four Great Powers at Dumbarton
Oaks in the United States last summer, and
from that conference emanated all the proposals that we now have before us, except
section C in Chapter VI, which deals with
voting privileges in the Security Council and
was formulated more recently at Yalta. In any
event the proposais represent for us now only
the views of the Great Powers on the kind, of
organization required to maintain future peace.
At San Francisco these proposals will go
before the larger body of some forty-four
nations, inchiding the Great Powers, for consideration and debate. Much criticism of the
details of the Dumbarton Oaks constitution
has already arisen in different parts of the
world, and amendments and adjustments in
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

its provisions will undoubtedly be made before the constitution finally takes its form and
is referred to us again for ratification. In the
meantime our function here is to analyse the
text before us and make whatever suggestions
we deem adivisable for the guidance of our
delegates, whether they may wish to adopt
them or not.
It seems to me, however, that the important
point to stress now is that the Parliament of
Canada, as well as the legislative bodies of all
countries sending delegates to California,
should reflect a willingness and determination
to assume obligations and commitments for
the maintenance of peace. I agree with those
who urge that there should be no evasion
of our responsibility in this connection. Both
Houses of Parliament are making it clear to
the Canadian delegation that this country
desires to become a member of the new world
organization and proposes to accept whatever
obligations finally emerge from the deliberations at San Francisco. The important clauses
of the constitution relating to voting powers
and sanctions will be thoroughly debated and
decided upon, and the final draft will be
submitted to us for ratification. It should be
clearly understood now that that ratification
must b final and without reservation; and it
will be the duty of our delegates to make
clear ithe bais- on wliich the charter will be
acceptable to Canada.
This naturally lcads to the question of
Canadas status internationally. If Canada is
to make comiitnents such as suggested in
rngard to the enforcement of sanctions in
Chapter S. the only sound and practical wayin which she can inake them is as a national
entity, completely responsible for all the
iipiilications of such a position. Certainly we
could net entertain the thougtt of Great
Britain, or any one Empire voice, committing
this country to the enforcement of sanctions.
It seens to me that on this point Canada
inevitably must be prepared in future to
accept ful rcsponsibility for the character of
ber own external and foreign relations.
This thought brings me to the very important matter of representation for this country
and other countries participating in the new
world organization. J do not think enough
attention has bun paid to tis aspect of the
-'ubject during the course of the debate in
this Chamber-or in the debate in the other
House. for that matter. To my mind, the
success or failure of the conference at San
Francisco in rcaching a desirable objective.
will be commensurate with its ability to found
the new association of United Nations on an
equitable and democratic basis. Representation in this world organization must he based

AIPRI'L 5, 1945W

as completely as possible upon, for one thing,
the principle of "no taxation without an
adequate voice" in the decisions to be made.
Otberwise, I cannot see Canada, or any other
nation, assuming obligations for any kind of
sanctions.
My friend, the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon.,Mr. Hugessen) the other day
dealt witb the significance of the veto power
given to any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, whicli, as the
charter now stands, isa Uic predominant factor
in controlling the entire world organization.
He thougbt that under such a provision
Canada would be in a favourable position

United States on the one band and Great
Britain on the other. But 1 am of the opinion.
and I feel very strongly on the matter, tbat
our position sbould be made clearer than that.
1 agree with the honourable senator that
Canada should not try to throw bier weight
around; and 1 think I can assure him and
other bonourable members here that there is
not much chance of that happening under the
leadership of the present Prime Minister of

Canada's influence should be cx:erteýd, and
should be feit, because we bave something
definite to contribute, something which is now
being recognized outside of our own boundaries. If we are to be subjeet to commitments in future, and that is implied in our
approach to the whole question, we must have
adequate representation in the deliberations
and decisions of any organization of the
United Nations. At present, under the provisions of the charter, the supporting miembers

This failure on the part of the charter in
its draft form. to distinguish between states,
which have sometbing to offer to the world's,
sedurity and those wihich have very ýlittie,
strikes directly at Canada's position. This
fact has been noted and coinmented upon
outside of this country as welil as within, and
lias ra.ised the suggestion of the classification
oif so-called "middle powers." Af ter ail, there
is no country which would be more likely to
be involved, in another world war Vhan
Canada. One of the clear resulte of the
present conflict bas beýen to inake of Canada
a buffer state between two very great powers
-as definitely a buffer area as ever Belgium
was h.etween France and Germany. In this
connection I should like to quote the London
Economiet:

in a category ail hier own. . . . In absolute

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Once recognition of the -special position of
'the Great Powers is translated into constitutional terms, formidable new difficulties arise;
for if it removes the absurdity of treating
Albania as an equal partner with the United
States, Britain or Russia, it leaves open the
absurdity equally patent and (once differentiation bas been admnitted) f ar more invidious
of placing Al.bania on the same footing with
Canada or Brazil.
The last quotation which I shah- make in
this connection 18 from the London Spectator,
which says:
There is no reeognized criterion for the
assessment of the magnitude of states, but
certainly a mere arbitrary division into great
and small will flot stand. Despite hier limited
population Canada bas exerted during the war
a military and industrial effort which puts her
littie, if at -aIl, below the -pre-war France as
a world power by any method of estimation.
The ýSpectator lias repeatedly made the point
that this problem of power would have 'to be
solved, by a more realistie division than is set
<lewn in the charter. It caTinot be a case of
"Great Powers" and the rest, for the rest consists not merely of Liberius and Costa Ricae, but
equally of Canadas and Brazils.
In order to meet and overcome this weakness in the draft charter, Canada, through
bier Prime Minister, lias already presented
ber theory of functional representation as

SENATE
exemplified, by the setting up of such international organizations as UNRRA; the International Civil Aviation Organization, with
headquarters in Montreal; the International
Monetaiy Fund and the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, as well
as the International Labour Organization and
the Universal Postal Union, wmhich have been
in existence for many years.
In July,. 1943, the Prime Minister said that
representation on international bodies;
be determined on a functional basis
-should
which will admit to full mnembership those
countries, large or sniall, which have the
greatest contribution to niake to the particular
object in question.
Again on August 4 last when referring
specially to a proposed security plan, the
Prime Minister said:
'le Great Powers are called by that name
simply because they possess great power. The
other states of the world possess power-and,
therefore, the capacity to use it for the maintenance of peace-in varying degrees ranging
fron almost zero in the case of the smallest
and weakest states, up to a military potential
not very far behindîl that of the Great Powers.
In determining what states should be represented on the Council with the Great Powera,
it is, I believe, nîecessary to apply the funetional idea. Those countries which have most
to contribute to the maintenance of the peace
of the world should be mîost frequently selected.
The nilitary contribution actually made during
this war by the inembers of the United Nations
provides one good working basis foi a selcetive

principle of choice.
The functional theory of representation, as
set forth hy the Prime Minister, is a sound
challenge to the theory of the "sovereign
equality of all nations," which is the formula
used in the declaration from Moscow. and
the basis of the present charter. In practice,
states do not exert equal influence either in
peace or in war. Tha:t is wliv the Great
Powers have always been able to dominate
the world. The danger is that a few of these
great powers will emerge from the present
world situation as an intcrnational dictatorship. As long as "sovereign cquality" is the
dominating slogan of a world conference the
real power will be shared only within a small
group of statcs.
When referring to the functional thcory of
representation, it should be noted that it is
more than a theory so far as Canada is concerned. Our part in the setting up of the
organization called UNRRA, and our representation on it now, form a practical example
not only of a sound and equitable basis of
international co-operation. but of the real
influence exerted by Canada in an important
world cause. It is worth mentioning here
that membcrslhip in UNRRA is based upon one
per cent of the national income of the parHon. Mr. LAMBERT.

ticipating nations.

We have already

voted

$10,000,000 on that account.
In the discussions which took place at
Bretton Woods on financial and monetary
matters, it is no secret that Canada's representatives had a great deal to do with the
shaping of the final, report which came from
that conference. And likewise at Chicago it
was definitely the influence of the Canadian
delegation which saved for the world some
prospect of establishing an international. association in civil aviaticn.
These illustrations surely go to prove that
definite functions to be performed in serving
a world need are a sound basis of representation in any world set-up. As a matter of fact
it has been well said recently by a competent
observer that the future success of the United
Nations will be assured when and if the
Economie and Financial Council provided for
under the charter bas been able, through this
functional service, to take the place of the
Security Council itself.
The most fundamental question that can
be discussed at San Francisco is, I repeat, a
standard for equitable representation in a
world organization. It should be purstied until
tihe right formula is devised and accepted.
A number of different ideas for the permanent establishment of a representative system
of world security have been submitted from
imany quarters. In an informative and interesting article publisied a couple of weeks ago
in the New York Times the idea of a
"weighted" or balanced representation for an
international conference was advanced. Six
different plans were suggested. I shall not
attempt to outline them all. They vary from
suggestions of representation on the bases of
land area, population and commerce to the
length of national frontiers, literacy, migration,
means of communication, and numbers of
international treaties which a country may
have entered into. Commander Stassen, while
Governor of Minnesota, insisted that a good
formula could be found to include several
factors. He mentioned literacy, the contribution of each nation to expenses of joint government, and the natural resources of cach
nation. Others have suggested plans of proportional representation, based on arbitrary
calculation of the size of a properly constituted world assembly.
These six plans simply illustrate the work of
sonie thoughtful people upon this question.
The important point is that they all recognize
that nations are not equal, and that the fairest and most acceptable basis for voting power
is that which emphasizes the human achievements, as well as population, of the different
nations.

AiPRIL 5, 1945
Now, in view of the uncertainties which
have arisen during the past week in connection
with the San Francisco conference, it is
possible that all that may come out of it
just now will be a continuatiop of the present
grand alliance of United Nations for the purpose of ending this war and creating some
kind of world order, out of which later a
permanent system of peace might develop.
That secms to have been the prevailing idea
at the recent conference of South American
and North American representatives held in
Mexico City. The Act of Chapultepec which
issued from that conference provided for a
provisional interim security system, effective
immediately, whose chief responsibility will be
to draft a permanent treaty embodying certain principles to be decided upon at a later
date. Incidentally, Canada bas been invited
to join with these South American nations and
with the United States in this Pan-American
arrangement for the future. At any rate, it is
to be hoped, as suggested by Mr. Walter
Lippmann the other day, that before April 25
the principal powers, through diplomacy, may
be sufficiently in agreement to avoid, any public disturbances or ruptures in present Allied
international relations. If such agreement cannot be reached in the preliminary conversations of the "Big Three" which are supposed
to be held in Washington before April 25,
then the San Francisco conference might be
postponed until it had a better chance of
succeeding; or it could go ahead on the basis
of an entirely different objective from that
contained in the present charter. It must be
admitted that at this date even these modifications in the publicized plans for the San Francisco conference would be most unfortunate.
Reference to the results of the present conference in Mexico City serves to emphasize
the use of regional arrangements and agencies
as part of the machinery for maintaining world
peace. The present charter contemplates such
a possibility, and membership in the new
world organization may involve the necessity
of membership in an appropriate regional
group. This war bas made it quite evident
that for economic and strategic purposes
regional commitments for Allied defence and
offence have been regarded as essential to the
joint cause. Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and the United States have all signed mutual
defence agreements, which are distinctly
regional in their application. Great Britain
herself attempted in 1940 to form a federal
union with France, and now for economic and
financial reasons, ber advisers are recommending the establishment of a regional bloc based
upon the pound sterling. Mr. Churchill a
couple of years ago suggested that the most
practical method of reorgan.izing world relations

after the war might be to establish three great
regions or zones of control, described roughly
as the Asiatic, the European and the PanAmerican areas. It is clear that regional interests would to a certain extent overlap in
such an arrangement. For example, all the
Great Powers have considerable interests and
responsibilities in the Pacifie. But an effective measure of co-operation for world peace
might be casier to realize through three representative regional organizations than through
one world agency directed by a council of three
or four Great Powers.
After considering the new world charter from
these several angles, we are finally confronted
with the realistic question: What is the alternative to it all? The failure of the United
Nations at San Francisco to give some hope
of world stabilization would do much to intensify a condition of chaos and demoralzation from which no nation would escape. The
very existence of civilization itself would seem
to be at stake, and I believe that Churchill,
Roosevelt and Stalin have thought of this
danger from the first of their conferences. That
is possibly the best reason why the California
conference must succeed.
Over the long term of years ahead the development and strengthening of an international
institution which shall protect the peace of
the world will depend upon the development of
a different sort of world psychology from that
which bas controlled peoples of past generations. It is, I think, becoming increasingly
evident that the self-centred thing called
"national sovereignty" must be enveloped in a
broader consideration of human democracy.
The word democracy itself needs re-shaping in
the minds of us all. It is not enough to equate
democracy with our acknowledged system of
parliamentary or responsible government, or
with our so-called systems of capitalism and
individual enterprise. These are only the forms
of certain aspects of democracy. The great
message which the United Nations -must ultimately convey to the world as the result of
their war against totalitarianism and dictatorship is that democracy is a dynamic system,
devoted to securing the largest possible measure
of freedom and welfare and development for
the maximum number of individual human
beings throughout the world, regardless of
national boundaries. To begin to realize even
a small measure of such an objective will
require a far-reaching and fundamental change
in the political thinking of democratic peoples
everywhere.
A brilliant American woman,
Susanne Langer, summed it all up the other
day when she said:
What we need, and what the leaders of our
age should aim at and foster, is (1) trans-

SENATE

70

national thinking; (2) international planning,
and (3) super-national administration and law.
How far it will be possible to achieve even
the beginning of this new outlook for mankind u.pon a world that has been devastated
by war, the coming conference in California
will answer, at least in part. To provide that
answer will not be a simple task. Canada's
part in it may seem unpromising and unimportant, but this country has a peculiar and really
worth-while contribution to make at this time.
It is a two-fold contribution. Canada seeks
no territorial gain; she lias no desire for world
power. She occupies an important strategical
area of the world's contracting surface. By a
fine example of international co-operation in
this war she has contributed largely to its
success, and is in a position to give further
of her wealth and resources to help re-establish
the world on a civilized basis. Furtber, b'
taking her due place internationally, she contributes to the upbuilding of ber own
character and individuality.
The problem of welding forty nations into
an international organization for peace is not
unlike the welding of nine provinces into a
dominion. If it is difficult for nine provinces,
strung across half a continent, to recognize
the need for unity of purpose and action
internally as a nation, how mucli more difficult
will it be for forty different nations, distributed
all round the globe, of different race, language
and cronomic interest, to reach the necessary
measure of agreement to bring about the
peace of the world? And yet the very act
of approaching this great task, with full appreciation of the obstacles to be overcome, may
well have the effect of helping Canada to
overcome ber own internal weaknesses. By
the very process of contact with other peoples
in international conference we may, in perspective, very well see ourselves as others sec
us. Our young men and women abroad to-day
fighting for their country have that perspective; they know what it is to be Canadians.
California may well become the mirror in
which this country for the first time may seo
herself in truc proportion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, lear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Witbout that vision
we cannot expect to do much for ourselves or
the world at large. The responsibility for
measuring up to the standard expected of us
in our demands for increased national and
international status is right here, in these
Chambers of Parliament, in the kind of thinking and leadership which we give to this idea.
Before taking my seat, I should like to

Suppose for a moment that the present

and that the leader and possibly all the meibers of the delegation from the other Hou.se
were unable to appear in the next Parliament.
WVould the continuity of Canada's interests
in the cause of peace be then well served?
This, I maintain, is a very proper question
to be raised in the Senate, which is enabled
by the Constitution to safeguard the continuity of such a vital national interest.
Because this is so, it seems to me that the
delegates who go from the Senate to San
Francisco will have an added responsibility
ihrown upon them. I mighît almost argue
that a much larger delegation from the Senate
than lias been forecast should go to the conference, in order that the country may be
assured that its representatives will have a

place in which to make a report when they
corne back from their work. I mention al
this because I believe there is stili some
ground for ýthinking that the life of this
Parliament shouid be extended instead of
being dissolved.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The delegation to
San Francisco would then submit its report
and recommendations to the bodies that
authorized it to go there, and thereby the
Canadian electorate would receive much
needed enlightenrùient and leadership on the
subject before being asked to, go to the
poils to elect a new Parliament and a new
Government. What is of greater importance
stili, in my opinion, is that the hundreds of
thousands of young men an-c women who are
activeiy engagcd ini serving this country's war
needs abroad would be given more time to
bring to bear the fuit impact of their thought
and influence upon the great question deait
with at the conference. Certainly they have
a larger stake in the future than ýmost of us
have, and just as certainýly they have earned
the right to exercise an active hand in remoulding that future.
I submit, honourabie senators, that in the
disposai of this matter lies the answe to the

DELEGATES TO SAN FRANCISCO
CONFERENCE
SENATE REPRESENTATION

On the Orders cf the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Hlonourable senators, I
shouid like te refer briefly te the siiatement
made by the Prime Minister in the House cf
Commons on Friday iast regarding the dolegatico whichi is te accompany him tc the
Worid Security Cenference te ho held at San
Francisco, beginning on April 25.
The Prime Minister bas expressed the desir1iiity cf bax iog the delegates represent as
ivide a field of political thotîght, in Canada as
possible. With tlîis in view, from the parties
epposing the Government in the House of
Cemmons, ho bas inviteul te accompany him
Mr. Gordon Graydon, lieuse leader cf the
Progressive Conservative party and Mr, J. M.
Coldveil, leader cf the Ceeperative Cemmonweaiîh Fedieration. The Gexeroment side cf
the Hotîse wiil ho represented by the Prime
Minister, the Honcurable Mr. Louis S. St.
Laurent, Minister cf Justice, and Mrs. Cora
Casselman, the lady member from the censtituecy cf Edmonton.
I arn sure it wiil ho gratifying te honeurabie
senaters te knew that this Chamber wiii have
two cf its members on thýat delegation.
In the matter cf ropresontatien, I think we
have been genercusiy treated. As GovernHon. Mr. KING.

ment leader in the Senate, I have been asked
to attend this conference. I wish te say that
I feel greatiy honoured, not only because I
have been chosen a member of the delegation,
but aiso at being one of the two seiected for
the signal honour of representing t.he Sonate of
Canada.
Some Hon. SEN'ATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I arn very appreciative of
the distinction which has been conferred upon
me, and also of the great responsibiiities, and
obligations thereby entailed. I can oniy say
that I wiil give my best judgment and abiiity
to the matters that wili come to us for consideration.
At this point I should like t.o thank honourable senators who, after much thought and
great care. have doiivered such excellent
speeches in this Chamber on the sub*joct of
the San Francisco conference. I assure thom
that their addresses wilýl receive most careful
st.udy.
I know we ail regret that my honourabie
friend the leader opposite (Hon. C. C. Baliantyne) bias not found it possible to accept t.be
invitation extended to him by the Prime Minister te be one of the ropresentatives of this
Chamber at the conference. In a letter to
the Prime Minister, the honourable gentleman
lias indicated that hoe will ho unable te accept
tbis responsibiiity, and se that our record may
lie conipiete I should like to read this letter.
It i. a,~ foliows:

My dear Prime Minister:

United Nations San Francisco euînferenice te ho

Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie Ring,
P.C., C.M.G.,

Otta
I shouid like te associate myseif with the
Prime Minister in expressing disappointment
that my honourable friend will not be attending the conference.
H1e wouid be a very
valuable member of the delegation because of

APRIL 10, 194573
tbe knowledge and experience he gained
in bis association 'wjth Sir Robert Borden
when conferences on pence and security were
beld after the last war. As is well known, my
honourable friend bas bad a long career in
Parliament-in the TTouse of Commons and
in the Senate-and bis acceptance of tbe invitation to go to San Francisco would bave been
most gratifying, I arn sure, ndt only to the
Prime Minister but to the other delegates wbo
will accompany hirn.
The honourable gentleman's inabiity to
accept bas necessitated the selection of
anoyther senator from the party opposite, and
I know that all members of this Chamber
are pleased that tbe bonourable senator from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) bas been ebosen.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. KING: In bim 1 sball bave a distinguished and able colleague wbo will share
with me tbe honour and responsibility of
representing tbe Senate of Canada at tbis
important and bistorical conference. I believe
we aIl feel that altbough tbe individuals composing the delegation may vary in their political views with regard to affairs in Canada, the
delegation as a whole will go to tbe conference
united in its endeavours to realizeý the bope
that is in the mind of the Canadiian people,
namely, that out of this international organization will corne better conditions, world
security, and the avoidance of warfare.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I arn rather overwbelmed by the kind
references to which the honourable leader bas
just given expression, and 1 want him to know
that I sincerely appreciate what ha bas said
about me. As my letter to tbe Prime Minister stated, nothing would bave given me
greater pleasure than, to bc a member of the
delegation to tbe San Francisco conference. But
insurmountable difficulties tbat I do not need
to go into bere made tbis impossible. I take
pleasure in infurîning you, honourable senators, that I was received in a most gracious,
friendly and courteous way on two, occasions
by the Prime Minister, who certainly did bis
best to prevail upon rne to attend the conference; but, as I have already said, it, was
impossible for rne to accept.
I know I speak fer all other honourable
memnbers of this House as well as for myself
when I say that tbe Prime Minîster is fortunate indeed in having the bonourable leader
of the Government in this Housa (Hon. Mr.
King) as a member of the delegation. It was
right and proper that he, should have been
selected, not only because of the position he
32289-6

holds in this Chamber, but because of the
fact that he has had a long and distinguished
career in public service, first as a member of
the Legisiative Assem.bly of British Columbia, and since as a member of Parliarnent and
as a Minister of the Crown. The knowledge
that he has accumulated and the ability that lie
bas developed dîuring bis long years of service
eminently fit hlm to go to the conference as
the senior delegate. from this Chamber.
May I be perrnitted also to extend my congratulations to my honourable friend from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud), who bas been
selected as the second delegate from the
Senate. The Prime Minister was good enough
to eall me at Montreal by telephone and say
that he was desirous that the delegation from
Canada should flot exceed .seven members, and
inasmuch as a French--speaking member of the
other House was a delegate, in tbe person of
tbe Minister of Justice, it was thought only
rigbt and proper that a French-speaking mnember of the Senate, and especially such a distinguished one as my honourable frîend from
La Salle, should be chosen from our side of
this Chamber. I speak, Senator Moraud, not
only for myself, but for every honourable
senator on this side of the bouse in wishing
you a safe and pleasant journey and a successful mission.
Before I sit down may I join. with tbe
honourable leader opposite (Mr. King) in
again expressing the hope so often expressed
in this Chamber during tbe debate that the
San Francisco Conference will resuit in the
laying of a sure and lasting foundation for
world peace and security.
Honourable
Hon. LUCIEN MORAUD:
senators. I -wish to thank the bonourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. King) and my
own leader (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) for the kind
words they have just spoken about me. I
must say that when we adjourned last week
I had not expected that this *bhonour would
faîl îipon me. I was only advised of it on
Sunday last.
-I am very sorry that the honourable leader
on our side, who is so well qualified to be a
delegate to, the conference, could not accept
the Prime Minister's invitation-and, witbout
false modesty, I should like to add that rnany
of my colleagues are better qualified than. I
arn to be included among those who are to go
to San Francisco. However, I understood
that whatever might be rny deficiencies it
was my duty to serve, and I feel greatly honoured. I can assure bonourable members that 1
arn fully aware of the obligations which I bave
undertaken, and of the consequences which

we all hope will flow from this conference. You may be certain that I will do my
best to prove worthy of the confidence which
bas been placed in me.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CONFERENCE
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April
5, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. King:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament do aiprove the following resolution:
Whereas the Government of Canada lias been
invited by the Government of the United States
of America. on behalf of itself and of the
governnents of the United Kingdon of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republies and the itepublic of
China, te send representatives to a conference
of the United Nations te be helld ou April 25,
1945, at San Francisco in the United States of
America to prepare a charter for a general
international organization for the maintenance
of international peace and security, and
Whereas the invitation suggests that the
conference consider as affording a basis for
such a charter the proposals for the establishment of a general international organization
which have been made public by the four
governments whici participated in the discussions at Diimbarton Oaks, Washington, and
Whereas the Govermnent of Canada lias
accepted the invitation to send representatives

te this conference,
Therefore be it resolved:
1. That this House endorses the acceptance
by the Governient of Canada of the invitation
to send representatives to the conference;
2. That this House recognizes that the establishmsent of an effective international organizatien for the mnaintenance of international petiae
and security is of vital importance to Canada,
and, indeed. to the future well-being of mankind: and that it is in the interests of Canada
that Canada should become a nienîber of such
an organization;
3. That this House approves the pu rposes and
principles set forth in the proposals of the fotr
goveronients, and considers tiat these pioposals
constitute a satisfactory general basis for a
discussion of the charter of the proposed

inter-

national organization.
4. That this House agrees that the representatives of Canada at the conference should use
their best endeavours to further the preparation
of an acceptable charter for an international

organization for the maintenance of international peace and security:
5. That the charter establishing the international organization should. before ratification.
be suîbmitted to Parliament for approval.
Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD: Honourable
senators, the motion before us calls for the
acceptance by the Government of Canada of
the invitation from the Government of the
United States to send representatives to the
San Francisco conference, which is planned
Hon. Mr. MORAUD.

as a general assembly of peace-loving nations
to draft a world charter for the maintenance
of international peace and security.
So far I have heard of no good reason why
Canada should refuse the invitation. Canada
has invested heavily in world peace. With
a population of a little more than eleven
million, she has invested in world peace nearly
one million men and some twenty billion
dollars.
Let us not expect too muoh of the San
Francisco conference.
Let us be satisfied
that a great deal wil-l have been accomplished
if forty odd nations get together and agree to
agree on ways and means to prevent future
aggression and another world war. The Dumbarton Oaks conference outlined the establishment of four bodies as well as a code of
international procedure. The San Francisco
conference is expected to accept as a basis for
an international organization the principle of
four bodies-that is, a General Assembly, a
Security Council, an Economie and Social
Counoil, and an International Court of Justice
-and is to draft ries of practice and a code
of international procedure applicable to such
bodies. The prelininary proposals, as set out
in this pamphlet, have been studied and exIlained at length in both Houses of Parliament,
so that honourable mcibers are thoroughly
conversant with theni; but it is probable that
they wi'll be amended and revised ad infinitum
by the conference.
Our attention has more than once been
called to the suggestion that permanent members of the organization are not te be subjected to force by the Security Council. Much
may be said for and against Chapter VI,
section C, paragraph 3. It boils down to this,
that for the time being the "Big Three" will
be the pillars of the world peace structure. If
any of tbem are removed the whole structure
must collapse. War against any one of the
"Big Three" cannot be restricted to any
given area; it means world war again.
Much concern bas been aroused by the
news release that Russis would have two
voices in the General Assembly. It bas been
intimated that this night induce nations in
the Russian sphere of influence to come into
the Soviet fold without losing too much of
their sovereignty.
This may be entirely
without foundation. But does it really matter?
A big power like Russia can speak
loud enough with one voice. It is not the
number of voices, but the power behind them
that counts. If the voice of Canada is not
to be lost in the grand chorus, let us not try
to assume a role out of proportion to our
importance. We may achieve more if we do
not attempt the impossible.

APRIL 10, 1945
It

has been reiterated time and again, that

the conference does net purport to be a peace
cenference. The delegates will not have te
re-shape the map of Europe, decide as te the
punishment of war criminals, or provide for
modes of control and indemnities. The conference is limited te the drafting of laws, bylaws and measures designed te promote peace
and prevent aggression.
The laws are te be formulated before the
map of Europe and the Far East is re-shaped.
As a. rule. laws are made for men. net men
for laws. That is te say, if national boundary
lines, war penalties and .war indemnities are
net discussed at the conference, they will be
the main topies of discussion, in lobbies and
caucuses.
With this in view, I should like te add a few
words about a matter purposely omitted from
the agenda-I refer te the future of Poland.
The ghost of Poland will be hanging over the
heads of the delegates. Poland is one of our
Allies. Canada declared war as soon as Poland
Poland's sons have waged
was invaded.
war shoulder te shoulder with our sons.
Poland once saved civilization. Poland is a
Christian country of some thirty-five million
people. We are proud that Canada is more
than ninety per cent a Christian country.
During this war Poland bas suffered more than
any other nation. Yet, notwithstanding all
that, Poland has done and suffered ine defence
of civilization and liberty, she is apparently
te be singled out as the, one Allied country
which may lose the war whatever may be the
magnitude of the victory of the AlJied Nations.
I am aware that a friend of Poland who
spoke in another place was criticized by a
local paper for injecting disruptive propaganda
into Canadian politics. I am also aware that
a member of the Government bas tried to
justify the so-called Curzon line. We are now
concerned with foreign politics, and our delegates will not be in a position te fulfil their
mission of peace and security unless they go a
little deeper into modern history. In connectien with the Curzon line I should like te
quote the words of a mani who in 1939 was
instrumental in settling the eastern border of
Poland. I refer te Mr. Oscar Halecki, Director of the Poland Institute of Arts and Sciences
in America. Mr. Halecki is an historian of
international reputation, and the former head
of Warsaw University. Speaking in reference
to the Curzon line before the Ceuncil of
Foreign Relations in Chicago, Mr. Hadlecki
said in part:
How did this line originate? When we were
at the peace ceonference, we did hope that all

the frontiers of Poland would be fixed at
Versailles, in the East as well as in the West.
32289-6j

75

To-day many people believe that such an eastern
frontier really had been fixed at the conference
That is
and that it was the Curzon line.
entirely untrue. I remember the night, from
March 2 te March 3, when all the experts
of the Polish Delegation received a telephone
eall and were told that a memorandum on
Poland's eastern frontier was badly needed in
order to be submitted te the Big Four. We
worked the whole night through and drafted a
line more or less in agreement with the line
I have te
later adopted in the Riga Treaty.
confess that we went a little farther by including some districts which were left te Soviet
Russia in that treaty, because we knew, for
instance, that, in the Ploskirow region in
Podoliov there was an enormous Polish peasant
population.
At the same time, however, a group of Russian
exiles-Russia was not completely silenced at
the Paris peace conference-submitted another
memorandum suggesting a line which, of course,
was not then called the Curzon line, and as a
matter of fact was the line of Empress Catherine
the Second. In say-ing that, I am simply repeating what bas been stressed in a very interesting
article in a Russian newspaper here in this
The article said
country a few weeks ago.
the Curzon line bas little to do with the British
It is a line drafted by
Foreign Secretary.
Empress Catherine the Second, a line which in
1795, after the third and total partition of
Poland, was supposed to be not an eastern
frontier of Poland, but a frontier between
Prussia and Austria on the ene side, and
Russia on the other. Going back to that line
at the peace conference of 1919, the Russians
made it quite clear that they wanted to keep
all of what Russia had annexed in the three
partitions of Poland.
Therefore, to say that we had an obligation
te consider that line as a definite eastern boundary of Poland is simply misrepresenting
history. And considering the problem from a
legal point of view, it must be recalled that
the decision announced in Article 87 of the
Versailles Treaty was carried out in the spring
of 1923, when all the great powers. including
the United States, definitely recognized the
eastein boundaries of Poland as fixed in the
Riga Treaty, the boundaries which existed without any controversy until September, 1939, and
which net only the Polish government but the
Polish people are claiming now.
I am loath, in speaking of Poland, te pro-

nounce her eulogy as if she had passed alway.
I cannot believe that the Allied nations will
quietly proceed te iron out their differences
without giving further help te this maimed
soldier of liberty and civilization. As regards
Poland, the conscience of the world is not at
peace; the British conscience is not at pe'ace.
For confirmation of this one has only te read
the Congressienal Record of the United States,
and the reports of the House of Commons in
Great Britain as they are found in the London
Times file in our library.
The Northwest Review of Winnipeg of
March 8, 1945, resoundingly echoes the British
conscience. I refer to a letter of the Catholie

are prepared to support any measure which
will lead to the formation of such an international organiz4tion for the guarantee of
future peace.
With the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard), who has just
spoken, I deplore the fact that Poland will
net be represented at this conference. I have
been an active member of the Canadian
Friends of Poland, an organization with which
I have done quite a Tittle work.
When speaking on the motion for an
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) made a statement to which
I had expected there would be some reference
in subsequent speeches. He said:
With all respect and humility I say that the
late President of that country made a great
mistake, and because he did not carry his own
people with him, he probably is as largely
responsible as any other man in the world for
the terrible conflict in which we are now
engaged.
As a former President of the League of
Nations Society in Canada, I should like to
comment upon that statement. From pronouncements of leaders of opinion in the
United States and from views expressed by
people with wh-om I have talked, I have come
to the conclusion that the ideals of President
Wilson exercised a sound influence upon the
thought of the American people and were
largely responsible for the swing from the
former United States poliey of isolation. I
heard only yesterday that a Gallup poll
showed eighty-two per cent of the people of
the United States as favouring participation
by their country in such an organization, as
the League.
Two or three years ago the
former home of President Wilson was dedicated as a national shrine, and on that occasion
his great work was heartily endorsed in a
speech by President Roosevelt.
Only last
week the New York Times quoted Senator
Connally, Chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee of the United States Senate, as
having said at a mass meeting of the League
of Women Voters in New York city:
It is sometimes said that the League of
Nations was a failure. That is an unjust
charge. It may be admitted that it was not a
ceomplete success. It did, however, serve a useful purpose.

It was an experiment in a virgin field. It
could not be expected to attain perfection. It
supplied the foundation, however, for further
and more complete exertions for the future.
The history of the League will light the pathway
along which nations will travel in the years to,
come.
I may now say that it may form the basis
and the concept around which the instrumentality which we seek to establish may be
constructed.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), who was present with Sir Robert
Borden and Mr. John W. Dafoe at the Peace
Conference in Paris, has spoken of the universal
acclaim with which President Wilson was received when he presented his much cherished
Covenant in the Clock Room of the Foreign
Office at the Quai d'Orsay. Great hopes for the
future were entertained then, and no person
who witnessed the spontaneous enthusiasm with
which Wilson was greeted in the streets of
London, Paris and Rome could doubt the
sincerity of the aspirations for peace which
were expressed at the end of the last war.
To those who have followed the sad story
of the defeat in the United States Senate of
the motion to enter the League of Nations, it
is clearly evident that Wilson's political opponents, lead by Senators Lodge and Borah,
resorted to subterfuge. This is freely admitted
by Senator Lodge's chief lieutenant, Senator
James Watson of Indiana, in his book "As I
Knew Them." It says.
"Eighty per cent of the people are for it.
Fully that percentage of the preachers are right
now behind it

. .

. all the people who have

been burdened and oppressed by this awful
tragedy of war . . . are for it . . . I don't
see how it is possible to defeat it. . . ." He

turned to me and said, "Ah, my dear James, I
do not propose to try to beat it by direct
frontal attack but by the indirect method of
reservations."
We realize to our sorrow to-day that unfortunately this policy was only too successful.
The first President of the League of Nations
Society in Canada was Sir Robert Borden,
and to the last he maintained his interest in
the Society's work. I am very proud to have
been associated with that great man, J. W.
Dafoe. I think it is generally conceded that
be did more than any of his contemporaries
to influence the CanadÏan public to think
internationally.

that his powerful personality is absent to-diay,

APRIL 10, 1945
under the great Dr. Fridtjof Nansen the resettlement of several million refugees was
arranged, with passport certificates, legal
status, transportation, as well as financial help
for the destitute.
Honourable members are familiar with the
great progress made by the League in limiting
the manufacture and sale of narcotics, in
checking the traffic in women and children,
and its achievements in the economic field.
One overwhelming problem before us to-day
is the re-education of the world, and particularly the youth who have been inoculated with
Nazi and Fascist doctrines. We have in
addition the children who have grown up in
the occupied countries warped in mind and
body. Many have played an important part
in resistance movements and have been taught
to lie, to deceive, to steal and to assist the
underground in any way possible. I was
pleased to learn within the last few days that
the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation was
about to be re-established, with headquarters
in Paris. The Institute accomplished valuable work, but did not achieve its real
purpose for, in accordance with the aristocratie
organization of education in European and
Latin-American countries, practically alil representatives came from university circles.
Each country wished for purposes of prestige
to be represented by its greatest scholars; thus
Finstein represented Germany; Madame Curé,
Poland, and se on. With a rude shock, the
democracies awakened to the fact that the
totalitarian states were devoting their attention
to elementary education which was pure
propaganda for the purpose of realizing objectives put forward by the dictators. A new
generation arose 'with fantastic ideas concerning race, the over-all place of the state
in life, and the complete subordination of the
individual.
In 1936 Dr. W. E. Dodd, then United States
Ambassador to Germany, stated,:
There is not a country in Europe where it
would be possible to start a war if the people
had been taught history accurately for a
generation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Education has received
no specific recognition in the scheme drawn
up at Dumbarton Oaks, but -it is expected
that it will be provided for in the Economic
and Social Gouncil. Every nation has a culture which is the result of hundreds of years
of experience, and to which it is devoted.
We have been struck by the failure of the
Nazis everywhere to force their view of life
upon the defeated peoples. Any scheme for
international educatioq must be voluntarily
adopted. I heard on Saturday that the con-

ference at San Francisco will be attended by a
large body of educationists from the United
States, who will be prepared to let people in
all parts of their country know of decisions
taken, and thus have an informed publie
opinion ,prepared to support their policies.
We have not been advised of such a plan for
Canada, but it is important that Canadians
also should understand the provisions adopted
at San Francisco, which may mean so much
to them and to their children.
Recently I read a statement by Air Marshal
Bishop in reply to a query as to what form
of memorials we should raise to our heroes
of the present war. He said:
If we are to build monuments in memory of
our own dead in World War No. II, let us
make them realistie; let us form foundations
to teach the youth of Canada that war is a
grim business, not a thing of glory. Let us
teach them that what is needed in the world
of to-morrow is not people to die for their
country, but people to live for their country.

Monuments in stone are inanimate objects, but
living memorials should be built to teach the
youth of the nation not only national but worldwide ideals for the good of mankind.

If there

were any way of asking a man who has died

for his country whether he wants a monument
of rock raised to the memory of the thing for
which he died, I doubt if there is much question
as to what his answer would be.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, there is little I can add to what has
already been said in support of this motion.
I congratulate the honourable senators who
have already taken part in the debate. They
have, I believe, expressed the sentiments of
our people with respect to the great task that
lies before the San Francisco conference.
I think we all realize more than ever before
that Canada is a self-governing n'ation. We
have reached a period in our national life that
we can very well be proud of. The position
Canada occupies in the world to-day has been
ga.ined by the blood of our soldiers who in two
great wars have given their lives in the cause
of liberty as we enjoy it on this continent and
throughout the British Empire. We should
never lose sight of the fact that we are
British and tha-t we live under the British
flag and enjoy self-government based on the
parliamentary system of Great Britain. We
are a democracy, and democracy is the one
thing which we must have in mind in approaching the great problems to be brought before
this conference.
In Canada we have great wealth, we have
something to offer to the other countries of
the world; we have the opportunity ofi offering a better life ta many people in the other
countries of the world.
We must at all
times assume our responsibilities in trying to

that people all over the world are astounded
at the way in which we in this country and
our neighbours to the south have been able
to live in peace and harmony for the many
years we have enjoyed life on this continent
together. To-day we must assume our place
as a part of the peace-loving people of this
continent, and realize that in the future we
must think as North Americans. We must
net be at all disturbed by arguments w'hich
may arise from time to time as to whether
or not we are getting farther away from the
Mother Country. I do not think we are.
I think that our understanding with the
people of the United Kingdom to-day is
better than it bas ever been before. Improved methods of transportation and the relationsbip thiat has existed between us dýuring
the last few years has brought us closer together. We are all peace-loving people; we
believe in democracy. I am sure that the
people of Great Britain and t1hose of the
United States, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand are now closer together than ever
before. We must do everything possible to
promote good-will and' understanding between
these nations.
I think that we in Canada are in a position te contribute much to the development of good-will and understanding between
the people of the United Kingdom and the
people of the United States. We understand
them, and I think they understand us. The
delegates from this country who attend the
conference at San Francisco will have a great
part to play in helping to bring about understanding between the grecat peace-loving
peoples of the democracies of the world.
I should like to draw attention to one phase
of the proposals for the establishment of the
general international organization. The bonourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) referred to a different method of determining the representation on the Security
Council.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

Functional representation based on the part
that any member shall take in the organization,
and the responsibility of each in maintaining
peace is very important.

secondary power. The great powers are great

nations so far as production is concerned. Who
can say what our position will be in ten,
fifteen or twenty years' time, assuming that
our population increases, as I venture to
suggest it will. Who can say what we would
have been able to accomplish to-day or what
position we would occupy among the world
powers if we had had a population of twentyfive million in this country? We have unlimited natural resources; we have a spirit equal
to that of any other people. The accomplishments of the eleven and a half million people
of this country have astounded the rest of the
world. I venture to say that if there shall
bc tine to consider and discuss the basis of
functional representation this country will be
in a position to demand representation on that
basis on the Security Council.
I suggest that it is important that this
country should have representation on the

sornething to offer to the rest of the peoples

of the world.
As bas been suggested by honourable members, the Economic and Social Council rnay

very well be the important factor in this whole
organization; in the next number of years we
will bave to belp feed the people of Europe.
I suggest tbat we must not lose sigbt of the
fact tbat during war nations are drawn together to figbt an enemy. In this war people
of different political philosophies bave joined
together to figbt Germany. When tbe war is

ended we will bave destroyed the enemy that

must look for another enerny-an enerny that
will tbhreaten tbe peace and civilization in this
world unleas it is destroyed. That enemy is
poverty, wbicb exista in many countries
tbrougbout the world, and I suggest that
through the mediurn of the Social and Economic
Council the nations can join together and flgbt
that enemy. In tbat respect Canada is in a
position to pîay a more important part than
rnany of tbe other countries. We in Canada
believe that poverty mnust, be destroyed. It
makes not a particle of difference wbether the
poverty exista in a section of this country or
in some section of Europe; as long as it exista
there will be people who wilýl take advantage
of it, and there will be unreat and political
upheaval wbicb will again destroy tbe peace
of this world.
In approacbing this question we are always

we must approach the solution of the problems of the future in a different way than we
have in the past. We must resolve that we
will work together in peace as we have in war;
we must be prepared to give and to take, to
share our wealtb, and we must find ways to
distribute the world'a goods. Once we have

done that we shall have taken a long step
towards peace tbroughout the world.
I loin with others wbo have expressed confideýnce in the delegation that will go forward
frorn this country to San Francisco. I tbink
we are fortunate in having at the head of that
delegation a Prime Minister wbo bas had
long experience, and is recognized as a peaceloving statesman wbo has spent his life
atternpting to solve the problems of the common man. I amn sure the delegates from this
country will realize the great responsibility
devolving upon thern.
I agree with the staternent made 'by a
number of honourable senators that this Bouse
can make an important contribution to the
development of better international understanding and relationsbips. When our representativeýs corne back frorn San Francisco their
report will form a basis for a further discussion
and consideration of international affairs. The
Senate is well qualified to study this subject,
and other subjects of a non-political character
whbich affect the people of the country as a
whole.
We must not loac sight of the fact that the
country which eaused the present war and the
preceding one is Germany. 1 venture to say
that there is no member of this Chamber or
of the other House, indeed no person in Canada, who does not at heart fear the possibility
of futurc upheavals in Europe at the banda of
the Nazis. It seerns to me that one of the
great problema for the Peace Conference will
be how the German people can be deait with
in order ta make sure that neyer again will

and involving the whole world in another

The Sonate resumed from yesterday the

That it is expedient that the Hoises of

Whereas the Governmsent of Canada has been
invited by the Government of the United States
of America, on behalif of itself and of the
governments of the United Kingdom of Great

Wiereas the Goverinment of Canada has

to send representatives to the conference;

2. That this House recognizes that the establisisnent of

of international

peace and sectsrity is of vital importance to
Canada, and, indeed, to the future well-being
of man-kind; and that it is in the interests
of Canada that Canada should becone a inember
of such an organization;
3. That this Housse approves the pusrposes and
principles set forth in the proposals of the four
governients, ans considers that these proposals
constitute a satisfactory general basis for a
discuission of the charter of the proposed international organization;

4. That this Honse agrees that the representatives of Canada at the conference should ise
their best endeavours to fuirther the preparation
of an acceptable charter for an international
organization for the maintenance of international peace and security:
5. That the charter establishing the international organization shouild, before ratification,
be sibrnitted to Parlianist for approval.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, if the only thing to be considered in

this debate were the passing of the resolution,
any further .remarks would be out of place,
because undoubtedly there is complote unanimity in the Sonate with respect to the
resolution, which simply records approval of
the Governmen't's acceptance of the invitation
te attend the San Erancisco conference,
expresses our confidence in the delegation, and
indicates that we are in favour of the proposed international organization. It is difficult
to understand the mental processes of any
peace-loving Canadian who opposes this resoluation, and there is certainly not such a one
Hon. Mr. KING.

in this Chamber. But while the resolution
may net justify further discussion, the occasion
requires the fullest consideration, and I think
this responsibility falls particularly on the
Senate. As a group of men of experience, and
I hope of some wisdom, it is fitting and necessary that our views and conclusions should be
made available, by way of discussion here, to
those who will go as delegates to the
conference.
There is perhaps an even more important
reason why we here should discuss the proposed
international
organization.
In
a
democracy public opinion is always the power
behind those who act for the democracy.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Therefore it is essential
that we discuss the subject to give a lead to
all the citizens of Canada. In the circumstances it is not sufficient that we give more
lip service to the proposal before us by voting
for the resolution.
For these reasons, honourable senators,
although a good many speeches have already
been made in this debate-speeches which I
think you will agree are a credit to the Senate
and to Canada-I make no apology for continuing the debate.
The proposal is that once again the world
join in an effort to achieve enduring peace.
That, honourable senators, is a very ambitious
proposaL. It is one that in all the history of
the world has never yet succeeded. Looking
over the prospects, I think there is really only
one encouraging reason why it may succeed
at this time. I cannot bring myself to believe
that it will succeed because we are going to
have a botter world than before. It is not
my belief that human nature can possibly be
improved by continued and awful brutalityand that is what we have experienced and
have had to take part in for now nearly six
years. If there is a real chance of this
scheme succeeding at this time, when it never
did before, it will be primarily for the reason
that mankind now appreciates the consequences of another war as perhaps never
bhfore. From the experiences we have iad
twice in our own time we cannot help realizing that science, in what it bas achieved and
is likely to achieve in the immediate future,
is so mastering the mechanics of annihilation
that if there is another war civilization will
be capable of complete self-destruction.
In sending our delegates to San Francisco
we are seeking to evolve a plan for peace to
become effective after the war is over. But
first it is essential that there shall be victoryand with the greatest satisfaction we are
conscious of how much botter the prospects
for that victory look to-day than ever before.

APRIL 11, 1945
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But following that vietory and anterior to the operation of this
seheme there bas to be a treaty of victoryI put it that way rather than as a treaty of
peace. The plan to be worked out from the
agreement reached at Dumbarton Oaks is in
its essence a treaty of peace. What will
happen after this war is over is, first, a treaty
of victory. The success of the proposals we
are considering will depend largely on the
intelligence with which that treaty of victory
is made effective.
Now, honourable senators, let us keep it
clearly in mind that the -essence of this mission to San Francisco is peace. That should
be written in every rnan's mind in large
letters. This is not a proposed world organization for the sake of that organization; it is not
a plan to make representation for the sake of
representation or to determine which nation
shaîl have the most important representationSorne Hon. SEN ATOllS: Heur, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS :-it is flot to make
commitrnents or refuse to make them for the
sake of those cornritments or for the purpose
of avoiding thern; it is not to consider trade
that wveare going down there; it is not even
freedomn or dernocracy for the sake of democracy that we are concerned with at this tirne.
I am n ot helittling any of thee things, or
their importance in themselves but I want
to have our thinking straight, because it
is in that way that progress is best made.
The issue which will ho discussed and passed
upon at San Francisco, and I hope acted
upon, is peace for the sake of peace-peace
permanent and enduring.
Now, I propose to discuss this question at
some length because I consider that time spent
in intelligent consideration is worthwhile. I
have given sorne tirne to preparation and I
hope, bonourable senators, that what I say
may be of sorne use and may make some contribution to our thin.king about these proposaIs.
I wouhd ask you to consider this question
under three heads: first, the attitude or frarne
of mind with which. we should approach it;
second, its direct relation to the proposals at
Dumbarton Oaks; and third, sorne of the
definite and sensible things which we as practical people can do to give effeet to these
proposals wben they are formulated.
First, the approach to this question. I think,
honourable senators, it is a primary essential
that every person shouhd realize that, standing alone, eloquent speeches about higher
ideals and what ought to bc done will neyer
save us from the aggressor in the future any
more than they have in the past.

83

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And so I would
approach the question with the thought in
rnind-not that we should now atternpt to
reform the world, or that out of that reformation rnight corne peace; but rather that out
of peace rnay corne the foundation on which
reforms rnay grow and develop, and our
idealism have full scope in future. If I arn
correct in this, there are two things we ought
to keep in mind, one being a realistic understanding of hurnan nature and the other of
world conditions. The honourable senator
from Roekcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) said last
night that there were two words she would
like to drop out of the language, one was
"appeasement" and the other was "realisrn".
I think that probably the only difference between the honourable senator's views and rny
own is one of definition. As to appeasement,
yes; I hope we shall neyer experience that
mental attitude agamn.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. PARRIS: As to realism, I have
this to say-I wrote it down last night when
the honourable senator was speaking: A
realist is one who believes in a practical
policy wbich will rnake i-dealism possible.
Our plans at San Francisco must be made
practical euough to work; they must be
realistic enough to meet the situation in a
world where I think human nature has been
worsened by what has happened. Our plans
mnust be sensible enough to endure-to endure
after our enthusiasrn bas cooled off. Let
everyone keep ini min4-and 1 hope our delegates will keep it in mind-how quickly our
enthusiasms subside eand how short are people's
memories; and that one a.fter another there
are new generations coming on which. have
not gone through our experiences. I make
rny suggestions to you based on the knowledge
that water will neyer rise highe.r than its
source, and based on the 'belief that our plans
will endure only if they are practical enough
to meet realities as they exist. It is not the
New Year's resolutions whieh. count--iwe have
ail made those--but the resolutions which
endure pýast Ea.ster, and during the heat of
summer, and when the cold of wintee has corne
again. It is my belief, honourable senators,
that permanent peace will be established only
if the peace-lo-ving nations of the world are
strong enough and deterrnined enough. to prevent war. The facts which I now state are
to me self-evident: it was organized force
which started the present war; it was organ.ized
force wbich finally overtook the start that the
enemy had and is now resulting in victory;
and it will only be organized force, properly
directed, wbich. can prevent another war.

SENATE

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let us look at our own
experience as a nation, or at that of any other
civilized nation that we know. How do we
maintain-to use the words of our own constitution--"peace, order and good' government"
in this country? Well, honourable senators,
we maintain it by an organized society in
which there are a Criminal Code, criminal
courts and police forces. If there should ever
come a time in our history when we decided
that psychology was better than the Criminal
Code and that psychiatrists and various other
officiais should supplant police officers, we
know what would happen to organized society.
Even though only a very small minority in
the community are criminally minded, I believe that thcse requirements, which we have
proved to be necessary among individuals,
are equally necessary in international relations.
I have referred to the peace-loving powers.
There are three great world-powers to-day.
There are other great powers, but the United
States of America, Russia and the British
Commonwealth of Nations are the great worldpowers to-day. China is a power but she is
not a world-power. France, which has been a
great power, and will be again, is struggling
at the moment to recover from her prostration.
When we come to deal with the Dumbarton
Oaks scherne, I think it is a fine thing that
France is one of the permanent members-not
for what she is to-day, but for wha.t she has
been and what she will be.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But speaking for the
moment of what I consider to be the basic idea,
the foundation, I should like to see an agreement between the three great nations.
Anthony Eden said this last May:
The responsibility for any future world
organization for peace should be constructed on
and around-I emphasize these words as being in accordance
with my ideas.
-on and around the four great poweres,He included China.
-and ail other peace-loving states should come
in and play their part in the structure.
Now, honourable senators, I do not want to
be accused of defeating the very thing I am
advocating-the practical-but I would like
to sec, as the basis of ail that is to follow, a
simple agreement such as this:
The United States of America.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The British Commonwealth of Nations.
Recognizing that enduring peace is necessary
for world welfare and the maintenance and
growth of civilization,
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

And believing that this pledge is an essential
prerequisite on which to found an association
of frce nations and build a successful world
administration based on justice and equality
before the law,
We do solemnly pledge one to another, and
to ail other nations of the world as follows:
(1) That we ourselves will keep the peace;
(2) That we will individually, collectively
and in co-operation with other like-minded
nations take adequate measures(a) to control and restrain any aggressor
nation from preparing for war;
(b) to prevent any nation fron beginning a
a war; and
(c) to stop any aggressor nation fron waging
a war so begun.
And to these ends we will provide and use
as may be rcquired ail our available power and
forces.
I would have that treaty signed by the
British Commonwealth of Nations.
Hon. Mr. LECER:

Hon.
what I

thought

May I ask, is that a

Mr. FARRIS: It is a quotation from
wrote. This is a treaty that I am
suggesting as indicative of the line of
that I am offering to the Senate.

Hon. Mr. LEGER:

It is very good.

Hon. Mr. FARIRIS: If I could convert this
theoretical proposition into a reality I would
have it signedi by every member of the British
Commonwealth of Nations. With respect to
the Dumbarton Oaks proposals other considerations apply, but there would be no more
complications in the way of having this treaty
signed as I have suggested than there was in
having the Treaty of Versailles signed in the
way that was insisted upon by Sir Robert
Borden.
There is, of course, no such treaty as I have
suggested, but I ba e a feeling that there is
the next best thing, namely, an understanding
between those three great powers. Whetber
you have a treaty or an understacding, you
mcust have a foundation before you can have
a superstructure. In the proposal we are now
considering there is a foundation and there is
a plan. Let us look at that plan just as if
we had heard nothing at all about Dumbarton
Oaks. After ail, this is a peace plan that we
are considering. Weil, what is peace? It is
freedorn from war. A straight lice is defined
as being the shortest distance between two
points, and the shortest way to peace is to
stop war. I should therefore hope to see three,
things incorporated in this plan with a view to
giving effect to the basic idea: an organization.

APRIL 11, 1945
to prevent the acquiring of armaments by
aggressors, an organization to prevent and stop,
war, and a world court of international justicej
An organization to prevent the acquiring of
armaments, and an organization to prevent
war! It seems so simple, honourable senators;
and it is logical. We have been brought up on
the doctrine that an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure. As I have already
said, our experience within our own nation
demonstrates the value of prevention. In the
Criminal Code of Canada we have laws not
only against acts of violence and disturbances
of the peace, but very drastie laws against the
carrying of certain kinds of weapons. Why?
Not because we are an unlawful community,
but because in Canada, as in every other lawful community, there are certain people who,
unless kept within check, will commit depredations. The same thing is true of nations.
In this debate an honourable member quoted
President Roosevelt
or Prime Minister
Churchill-I have forgotten which-as having
said that not ten per cent of the people of
the world wanted war. The simple, the logical
and the practical thing to do is to take care of
the unruly and the unlawful in world relations
as we do in our domestic relations.
Let us look at our problem from the point
of view of experience.
History is a great
guide.
Without elaborating upon them, I
will mention a few dates and incidents, just
as a reminder of what happened in the recent
past because of the failure of peace-loving
nations to take appropriate action against
aggressors. In 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria.
China, a member of the League of Nations,
appealed to that body, which appointed a
committee of experts. It was, I think, two
years before the committee brought in its
report, which gave Japan a slap on the wrist,
whereupon Japan retired from the League.
In 1935 Abyssinia was invaded, and sanctions
were applied against Italy. These things are
coming home to us. If I had my way I
should take that word "sanctions" out of the
new arrangement, for in my opinion sanctions
are only a source of aggravation and irritation. In international relations you either
inean business or you do not. If you apply
sanctions with respect to cloth and odds and
ends, but not with respect to the oil which
enables the aggressor to wage war, you simply
create a source of irritation to the aggressor
and of aggravation to yourself.
There was a man standing on the sidelines
in 1935, watching to see what the peaceloving world would do to check Italy. What
happened in 1936? That man, the greatest
enemy of humanity who has ever lived,

invaded and occupied the Rhineland.

In

85

July of the same year the Spanish civil war
broke out. I read the other day that Captain
Liddell Hart said that the second Great War
began in July, 1936. In 1937 the war between

Japan and China started. What do we
remember about that war? Well, we did not
object to the shipment to Japan of scrap
iron and other goods useful in the waging

of war. We also remember that later on the
Burma road was closed. In 1938 came Germany's annexation of Austria. Things began
to move faster then. In that same year
there occurred the partition of Czechoslovakia,
and next year, 1939, the second World War
began.
It would be unfair and idle to indulge in
recriminations about these things, but there
is every reason why each of us should look
into his own heart and say: "Just what was
my attitude at that time? To what degree
did 1, by voice or influence or in any other
way, endeavour to contribute to a different
situation?" They who can give favourable
answers to tihese questions are very rare.
Those who attempted anything are mighty few.
Two men did. Anthony Eden resigned from
the British Government. Churchill during the
years from 1932 to 1938 made many speeches
warning his country and the world of
Germany's re-arming, and the imminence of
war. His son assembled and published those
speeches under the title of Arms and tihe
Covenant. I have the book before me, and I
recommend it to every senator, and also to the
members of our delegation. If time was not
going so fast I should like to read a page or
two from this book; I will not do so.
Churchill gave ample warning of the threat of
war, but his warning was not heeded.
An Hon. SENAiTOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: To-day, with a conviction
born of reality, we know that over those years
the world, including Canada. was the victim
of a state of pacifism, which is an illogical
desire for peace that blinds man to realities
and makes him believe that what he does not
see will not hurt him. This is a characteristic which the pacifist holds in common with
the ostrich. When trouble comes the ostrich
sticks his head in the sand; the pacifist hides
his head under the blankets. All that we have
gone through from the time of the last war
up to 1939 has brought home to us some
wholesome truths that we should do well to
remember, whether we can make our children remember them or not. It is a fact that
too great a desire for peace defeats its own

end. Peace at any price means no peace at
all. Looking back, we can see clearly that we

APRIL 11, 1945
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It took Great Britain
*a long time to achieve democracy. Most countries in the world to-day are not capable of or
competent to have dernocracy. If it comes to
a country too soon, it fails. We saw that in
Italy, and there are other countries one could
narne. Russia is not a democracy. I am making no attack on Russia. I bear testimony to
her wonderful achievement in the social and
economic field and in this great war, but I
should think that Stalin would be insulted if
anybody said that Russia was a democracy as
we understand it. Take any nation-take a
nation that emerges from savagery. It does
not first achieve democarcy. The first sign of
organization is the big chief with the big stick.
Self-government only comes slowly, and down
the ages. We have had the Magna Carta in
Britain for seven hundred years. When King
John was forced to sign the Magna Carta there
was no democracy in Britain as we understand
it. It was the nobles who wrested power from
the king, and it was for themselves and their
class that Magna Carta was secured. The
great masses of people in England had never
heard of the idea of democracy at that time,
and if it had been given to them they would
not have known how to make it work. It has
taken England a thousand years to achieve an
effective democracy. This idea that you can
take a conglomeration of nations in all stages
of social and economic development with many
of them having no conception of democracy,
and expect to form them into a democratie
union, is to ignore realities and hope for the
imrpossible. But I have no doubt that some
day out of this organization, if we can hold it
together, a democracy of nations may be accomplished. As I said before, it is something
to look for and work for, and not to jump at
too soon.
Now, honourable senators, these are my
suggestions as to how to approach this question-I am afraid I have taken too long in
doing so.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No. no.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: As I said before I consider it of the greatest importance.
Now, "in the second pl'ace"-let us consider
the Dumbarton Oaks proposals that will be
submitted to the delegates at the conference
as a basis for discussion. You will! notice,
honourable senators, that the Canadian letter
of acceptance was a very guarded one. The
invitation suggested that the Dumbarton Oaks
proposals would be the basis for the scheme,
but the acceptance by the Prime Minister
stipulated that they would be a basis for discussion of the scheme, which I think is the
proper ground upon which it should be put.

87

No nation which goes to San Francisco should
be tied to the consideration of these proposals
further than to say that they are valuable
as a basis for discussion.
The recital to the Dumbarton Oaks proposals says that the organization is based on
the principle of the "sovereign equality of ail
peace-loving states."
My honourable friend
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) who
spoke the other night in one of the most interesting and best speeches I have heard in the
Senate-I did not hear my honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugesson)-expressed a little concern, over the meaning of
these words. If they mean what he suggested
they might mean, I could understand his concern. To me they sound a good deal like the
recital in another famous document-that "all
men are born free and equal." That depends
entirely on how you interpret them. I do not
think the recital in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals means that all sovereign nations are
equal. If this were the *meaning I would
challenge the statement. I would feel, more
like the Irishman who said he believed that one
man, was as good as another-and sometimes a
little better. The recital means to me that
each nation, is the equal of the other in its
rights to be a sovereign nation. That is all
I think it means. It is all it could mean, and
make any sense. Every nation is entitled to
be a free nation; every nation is entitled to
be a sovereign nation and to have the form
of government which the peoile of that nation
wish to have. In that sense all nations should
stand on, an equality. But when we consider
equality from the standpoint of intelligence, or
education, or wealth, or power, or force as a
means of waging war and the maintaining of
peace, it would be utter nonsense to suggest
that all nations are of equal sovereignty, because in that sense they are not.
In approaching the question that I have in
mind, one of the first things to consider is
the essential differences between the League
of Nations covenant and, the Dumbarton Oaks
proposals.
These have been canvassed so
often in this House and elsewhere that it is
not necessary for me to mention them fur..
ther than to have them before us sufficiently
for our discussion. The important difference
in on this question of peace and war. The
essential power of the League oif Nations was,
under Article XI of the 'Covenant, vested in
the League itself. Perhaps 'it would be worth
while recalling to honourable senators' memory what it says.
Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the members of the
League or not, is hereby declared a matter of
coneern to the whole League, and the League

parrture from what was contained in the old

are vested in the Council. as you will find

Hon. Mr. CADLER:

May I ask a ques-

tion there? You have been speaking about
two councils; one the Council of the League
of Nations and the other the proposed Coun-

cil.

How was the Council of the League of

Nations constituted?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It was not dissimilar to
the present Council in its set-up. A little later
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

I will clear that up completely, if the honourable senator will permit me. The make-up is.
not dissimilar. I think that is sufficient for
the moment. But the powers of the new
Couneil compared to those of the General
Assembly are far greater under the new
scheme than they were under the old one.
Further than that-and this to my mind is of
grea.t importance-the powers of the Security
Council are confined to peace matters. I will
mention some of the other committees later.
The Security Council is a council for peace
and is not mixed up with anything else. That
is why I like it. Matters that tic in with our
committees, other schemes, should be developed collaterally or in sequence after peace
has been achieved. The Social and Economic
Couneil is an entirely different committee.
Some honourable senators have said that the
Social and Economic Council may prove to be
of the most importance. I hope this will turn
out to be correct. The important -consideration
moment is that they operate
for the
separately.
There are two things whieli should be considered. In the Assembly itself each nation
lias one vote. I do not know what is going
to haiippen at San Francisco. J think we are
all sonewliat perplexed. I saw in the papers
that Russia was asking for three votes, and
that the United States did too, but later
abandoned its request.
Wliat should our position be? In the League
of Nations Assembly eaci nation iad one vote.
This gave 6 votes to the British Empire. The
same provision is contained in the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals. Russia is now claiming three
votes on the ground that she is made up of
separate and independent republics. J am not
now advocating any partieular plan; I am
simply pointing out some of the problems
whici will have to lie faced. The same question came up in the United States Senate
when the Treaty of Versailles was before that
blodv for ratification. I quote from Duncan
Hall's book "The British Commonwealth of
Nations", page 346, which records the reservation passed in its final form by the United
States Senate in March of 1920. It reads as
follows:
Until Part I, being the Covenant of the
Leagre of Nations. shall be so aniended as to
provide that tie United States shall be entitled

to cast a nunber of votes eriual to that which
any nrmber of the League and its self -governing
Iominions. colonies, or parts of Empire in the
aggregate shall be entitled to cast. the Unrited
e bouind.
States assurîmes no obligation to
except in cases where Congress lias previorisly
election, decision,
given its consent, byv any
report. or finding of the Corncil or Asseibly
in wiieh any mebinler of the League andî its
self-governing doniions, colonies. or parts of
Empire in the aggregate have east nore than

one vote.

APRIL 11, 1945
I do not for one moment suggest that that
was the real reason why the United States did
not enter the League; but, make no mistake
about it, that reason existed, and it is a thing
that must be kept in mind when we are again
dealing with this question. One of the best
sources of information about what happened
at Versailles is Sir Robert Borden's Memoirs,
to which I shall give some references before I
am through. As Canadians we have to consider our external relations from the point of
view of our position, on the one hand, as a
member of the British Commonwealth, and,
on the other hand, as one of the United
Nations. There can be no departure from the
principle which was fought out under the
leadership of Borden and Smuts, and definitely
established, that every member of the British
Commonwealth is a sovereign nation in its
own right. There is no camouflage in that.
I do not know enough about the constitution
of Russia and its component parts to discuss
it intelligently, but some of the delegates will
be well informed on this subject. It may be
that the various Russian states have independent national status, so as to entitle each to
a separate vote in the international organization.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That condition might
be created.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In law we have the
Perhaps I
term "colourable transaction".
should not have even suggested the idea, for
I do not know what the facts are, but a mere
colourable set-up by Russia or any other
country would not be fair and would not be
conducive to the smooth working of the new
international relationships that we hope will
be established at San Francisco. This matter
will have to be considered carefully by Russia
and all the other countries involved, and for
the outcome we shall have to rely upon their
good sense and honest endeavours. but, I
repeat, one thing cannot be questioned: while
the members of the British Commonwealth are
tied together as a family of nations as closely
as ever. indeed perhaps more closely than
ever before, each has international recognition
as a completely sovereign nation.
Next I want to deal with some of the problems concerning the Security Council. I am
sorry to be taking so long, but if honourable
senators think my remarks are worth listening
to I will go on.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes, go on.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There has been considerable discussion as to the right of the
five permanent members of the Security
Council, who are great powers, to prevent the
making of a decision by the Council against

89

themselves. The proposal is that this right
of veto would not become effective until after
the prelimináry steps had been taken. That
is to say, if the Council had before it for
consideration a dispute involving one of the
permanent members, that permanent member
would abstain from voting on the question
whether the dispute should be investigated
and a finding of facts made. But although
the Council has the right to investigate the
actions of any nation, it has not the power
to call on the members of the Assembly to
take action against any one of the permanent
members without that member's consent.
Theoretically, this is wrong, but practically
it is not wrong at all, for what good would
it do to confer upon the Council the right
to make a decision against one of the great
powers? Any nation that will risk breaking
its solemn pledge to the international organization will consider itself powerful enough to
succeed in a defiance of the organizaiton, and
if a nation takes that stand there will be
war. In such circumstances no attempt to
settle the dispute by pacific means will be
successful. That is why I think my hypothetical treaty would be an effective one if
it were converted into a reality. It seems
to me than an agreement between the three
great powers must be the very basis of the
hopes of peace-loving humanity at this time.
I read somewhere that United States Senator Vandenberg would go to the conference
with the suggestion that more of the small
nations should be eligible for seats on the
Council. 1 hope that suggestion is not followed. It strikes me that the simplicity of
the Council's structure as at present proposed,
and the power behind it, are what will make
it work. The greater the number of nations
on the Council, the greater will be the likelihood of squabbling. Did you ever see a
big dog start a fight? It is nearly always
the little scrappy dog that starts making
trouble, and then the big fellow has to step
in and finish it.
Let us now consider more directly some of
Canada's problems in relation to Dumbarton Oaks. Under the present plan Canada
is not one of the permanent members
of the Security Council or part of one of
them, for it is the United Kingdom, not the
British Empire. that is to be a permanent
member. So if Canada has a seat on the
Council it will be as an elected member. I
should expect that in the ordinary course of
events she is likely to be one of the first
elected members; and after filling out the
term of two years she would perhaps be
succeeded by Australia.

90

SENATE

I suppose there is no one among us who,
upon reading the proposed composition of
the Security Council, did not ask himself:
"Why should not one of the permanent seats
be reserved for the British Commonwealth
of Nations rather than for the United Kingdom?" This thing has to be faced squarely.
On the Security Council there is to be only
one permanent member for the British people,
and that must be either the United Kingdom
or the Commonwealth.
I noticed in the
Montreal Gazette a statement which seemed
to indicate that that paper was in favour of
having the Commonwealth as a permanent
member of the Council, with one vote. This
would mean that every time a question had
teobe voted upon in the Council all the
nations of the Commonwealth would have to
get together and by a majority decision, or
in some other way that does not occur to me,
direct how the vote for the whole Commonwealth should be cast.
I have lookled at the reports of the debate
in another place to sec if that idea was
advanced there, and I find that it was, by one
lonourable member. I do not want to offer
any criticism here of what was said in another place, but I think it would be within my
rights te discuss the principle involved in the
houtrable member's suggestion.
The fact
that lie happens to represent the constituency in which I expect soout to be casting
a vote for or against bim, perhaps gives me
a little more freedom to quote bis words.
This is what be said, as reported on page 119
of the House of Commons Hansard:
The Prime Minister iow bewi ails our iosition,
yet it is a direct result of the policies of lis

Government. Had the Canadian Governnent
so willed, tbe great world poxwer aît D mibartoii

Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The
British Commonwealth of Natiois cuiild hav

proposals as the power te hold al peininîîent

seat on the Seciirity Council.
Wbether that last sentence is correct or not,
I am net aware. It may be. I bave net beard
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) indicate that his view is the same
as that of the honourable member I have
quoted, but I doubt very much that it is.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is not.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, I should not think
it was. But it is a view that is expressed by
intelligent people and by some newspapers,
and for that reason I think it should be considered.
I say that view is an express
repudiation of everything that Sir Robert
Borden achieved after the last war.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
lion. Mr

FARRIS.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Sir Robert Borden was
confronted with the very problem that confronts us. Of course, the British Commonwealth of Nations as we now understand it
had not completely materialized in 1920. The
Balfour resolutions were agreed to in 1926,
and the Statute of Westminster, which gave
statutory effect to them, was passed in 1931.
But Sir Robert Borden had the vision almost
as it afterwards was incorporated in the
Balfour resolutions. Paragraph 4 of article 4
of the treaty provided:
The Council shall consist of the representatives
of the principal Allied and Assoeiated powers.
These were the United States of America, the
British Empire, France, Italy and Japan. So
the British Empire was included as one of
the members of the Council. Not only in
section 4 did the British Empire appear as a
member, but also in the Annex the representatives of Great Britain signed not only
for Great Britain but ambiguously, as if for
the whole Empire, including Canada and the
other self-governing Dominions. Then followed the signatures of the representatives for
the Dominion of Canada and for the sister
Dominions. Sir Robert was confronted with
this position: If you put a strict interpretation
on that ambiguous form of signature, and
Canada is included as part of the British
Empire, then she cannot become an elected
member. He said "I won't stand for that,"
and he gives a very interesting discussion of
this point on pages 950 to 953 of the second
volume of his memoirs. He took the question
up with Lloyd George and sent him this
memorandum on May 6, 1919:
In

order to set ail duiibt at rest it is ieces-

sa ry to anmend Article IV:
(a) by striking out
Empire

immeiîdiatelx after the words "The Britis]h
inpire"
iii the annex to the covenant.

Turn to the Annex to the Covenant and
you find "British Empire:'
Then follow
"Canada" and the other Dominions.
Sir
Robert was saying: "Before Canada, Australia, South Africa. New Zealand and India,
you must insert the United Kingdom, to show
bat
h;when Great Britain signs she is signing
not for Canada, but only for the United Kingdom." So insistent was Sir Robert that be
sent that memorandum to Lloyd George and
said, "I want it done that way in order that
there shall be no misunderstanding about
Canada's right to be recognized internationally
as an independent nation and so that she will
not be deprived of the right to be elected a

APRIL 11, 1945
member of the Council because she appears as
part of the British Empire." He tells us in his
book that he only withdrew from that position
when he got Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd
George to sign an undertaking as to what they
understood to be the true construction of
Article IV. It will be found at page 961 of
Sir Robert's Memoirs. They said in effect:
"We think the meaning of this document is
clear,-notwithstanding that Canada appears
as a part of the British Empire, she has the
right to be elected a member of the Council,"
which is another way of saying that Great
Britain was signing for the United Kingdom
only; therefore Canada, Australia and the
other Dominions signed as independent
nations and as such were entitled to be
elected to the Council. Honourable members,
if I had time I would quote what Sir Robert
said in his speech in the other House on the
motion to ratify the treaty. In September,
1919, Mr. Fielding had suggested that Great
Britain could sign the treaty and bind Canada,
whether Canada consented or not. Sir Robert
replied: "If that is your interpretation, you
are just a hundred years out of date." Since
that time another twenty-five or twenty-six
years have gone by, and the interpretation is
even that much more out of date.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: All members of this
assembly who cherish the British Empire, who
have its ideals at heart, and who want to
do everything to perpetuate this great family
of nations, should be a unit in their desire and
insistence that there be no complicated clause
in respect to this Council which will require
Great Britain each time she casts a vote to
seek the advice of every part of the Empire.
If she could not get accord on that basis,
then I do not know what the solution would
be. I have never yet heard anybody who
objects to the proposal I have given as an
alternative who has any intelligent solution of
the question.
Now, honourable senators, in this connection how essential it is that this greatest
League of Nations which has ever existed, the
British Commonwealth of Nations, be not
tangled up with agreements that can breed
discord, dissension and misunderstanding.
General Smuts, when addressing a conference
of the Empire nations in May, 1917, said:
Talk about a League of Nations, you are the
only League of Nations that has ever existed!
How can we as Canadians in the British
Commonwealth of Nations-for we can speak
as a family voice, if not as a political voice-

ui

how can we best serve this great ideal effort
for peace? There are dangers, honourable
senators, in the suggestions I have made that
some of the big powers might not live up to
the solemn obligations they are now undertaking; the United States might become isolationist-certainly there is no indication of it
now, but it might happen; Great Britain
might get the germ of pacifism again-even
we in Canada might get it; Russia might
decide that her destiny lay in world supremacy
rather than in co-operation with the other free
nations. If any of these things happen I see
no solution which will bring about a permanent
peace. But there is every indication that these
things will not happen and this time our
constructive efforts for peace may succeed.
What can we do to help? I think the first
essential is a better and more continuous and
clearer understanding of each other as between
the United States of America and the British
Commonwealth of Nations. I do not mean-to
use an expression I have heard in this debatethat we should "gang up" on Russia. Far from
it. But I believe the closer the En.glish-speaking peoples are together, the more we understand each other, the more all these false issues
are wiped out, the more unwarranted statements are explained away, the casier it will be
to come to a. real nation-like man-to-man
understanding with Russia.
And when, honourable members, we stop
to think of it, there never was anything in
the history of the world that ought to be
easier of achievement than a close association
between the British Commonwealth of Nations
and the United States of America.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We speak the same
language; to a large extent we have, come
from the same stock; we have the same traditions of government; we both believe ourselves to be. leaders in democracy and the
application of the principles of democratic
government; and, what to my mind is even
more important, we both have the same principles of justice; our literature, our religioneverything that ought to be the basis of real
co-operation between one nation and another
-are common to the British Commonwealth
of Nations and the United States of America.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let me say this, honourable senators. In this debate I have been surprised that my colleagues in the legal profession have not said more about the International
Court of Justice. As you know, war has
always been the court of last resort in international disputes. If you are to take away

,12

SENATE

that final court of decision, something must
take its place, and the only logical substituto
is an international court of justice. I can sound
a note of optimism in that connection. We
bave ad an international court of justice since
o
1920. There is a member on that court from
the United States. although the United States
itself nex er bocame a mombor of the League.
Professor Manley Hudson of Harvard Univecrsity is a inember of the court and lie bas
published at least two books gix îng much
information on the development of that court
and what it lias accomplishied. But its accomplislbments just touch the fringe of what can
and ought te be achievod.
1 sometimnes think. honourable scnators, that
in these days of grim realitios thero is a
danger that we ini this country mnax luse siglît
of what thc justice cf our courts means to our
people in their relations one to another. N_ýothiug rankiles like a sonse of injustice. Nothing
creates discord and hatrcd quickor than a
sensc of injustice. My fricnd is gctting thrce
pieces of butter, and I arn getting ouly one:
the resultant sense of unfairness will cause
more troublc than some really serions matter.
Ani so it is that in this country, in the
devclopment cf our dcmocracy which we
boast of, the courts aud the Nvhole organization of B3ritis.h justice as we undcrstand it
m ax well be reg'urded as the bulxwark of
ireedom. 1 say that with the greatest deferece to mx friends who live under the civil
law. for atter ail that is the samne justice with
modifications.
I believe that out of the
jurisprudence cf these two systems, working
'-ide by side, we shall develop a greater and
a1 higherý conception cf justice than perhaps
was exer knowu beforo.
Whiat has happcned in coonection with ccir
couirts at home should cifer great possibilities
for the futurc in internation.al relationships.
There i-i this to be said. The law'yers of
Caniada and the lawx crs. of the United States
under thieir rcespectix o organizations, the Canadian Ba:r Association and the Amierican Bar
Association, hav e in evcry city in Canada and
the LUited States a highlx' developed group
cf special committeet intonsivoly workiog on
this question, and the studios these Jawyers
are making are beiug gradually co-ordinatcd
and will ho available to the confcrence at
San Francisco. I regard as of the highest
impDortance thc flOw interest that the legal
profession in Canada and the United States
;taking in this question cf a world court
of justic. For the firsi time in our lives we
as lawycrs are hccming conscious of international justice. The prob.lems are many and
intricate. I will merely, mention a few, but
Hon. Mr. FARRI&-

I shalH ot discuss them. Undoubtedly we
baveo a good precodent in the way the present
court has been solectod.
The great essential is that these mon wh'o are
selccted shall not bc representatives of any
particular nation or interest. As lawyors wo
knov and naany laymen kncw too, that the
great cur-.e of arbitration is that each sîcle
appoints an arhitrator, and both together select
an umpirc. The net result is that there is
onî' ene aehitrator, the other two appointeos

want te sec that sxystem followed in or world
court. Professer Manle v Hudson is a member
cf the presenit court of international justice.
He is an American; bis country is not ex on a

Ho represcnts no

Honourable Senators, I have given emphasis
in my remarks to the need for a practical and
realistic plan for peace. In taking this stand
I would not wish to be thought lacking in

realities of a peace permanent and enduring
may come a realization of our ideals, so that
some day our dreams will come true.

EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME
GOVERNMENT WHITE PAPER

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
beg to table a Government White Paper on
employment and income with special reference to the initial period of reconstruction
(English and French versions). I believe that
copies of this rather important document are
being distributed te the post office boxes of
honourable members, or will be available on
request at the Printing Bureau.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CONFERENCE
PROPOSED REPRINT OF DEBATE IN SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a suggestion to the honourable the leader of the Goverament (Hon. Mr.
King) and to honouraibIe members in general.
Yesterday we had the privilege-the pleasure,
I would say-of listening to a magnificent
speech by our colleague from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris).
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: The views he then expressed are such as I am sure the Senate can
concur in unanimously.
It seems to me that the question which he
dealt with so effectively, so clearly, so logically, and which he so well supported with facts,
will confront our delegates at the San Francisco
conference. Few people understand our autonomous position as a member of the British

93

Commonwealth of Nations, and whether the
British Empire should have one or more votes
in the proposed international peace organization is a somewhat controversial topic. Having that in mind, I would suggest to the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King)
that an ample supply of the honourable senator's speech be printed in both languages,
for distribution at the conference. I quite
appreciate that any member of our delegation
could in a general way answer the question I
have mentioned, but the detailed information
and logic contained in the honourable senator's
address are such as to convince any inquirer,
not predisposed towards us, of Canada's actual
position within the British Empire.
I would suggest that the speech be edited
with a view to deleting certain paragraphs so
that it would be a concise presentation of the
facts, and that it be published in pamphlet
form under the heading "Canada's Position
Within The British Empire" or whatever title
may be considered most appropriate. Probably
the author himself would undertake to deal
with his speech along the lines I have indicated.
This address is by far the ablest presentation
of the facts in regard to Canada's status as a
self-governing Dominion that I have yet listened to. It would be most helpful to our
delegates at the San Francisco conference to
be able to present a copy of it to any person
who might raise the question of Canada's position within the Empire, so that he might see
for himself what we claim it to be. The
authority of the pamphlet would be further
strengthened if issued under the imprimatur
of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. KING: I heartily concur in what
my honourable friend has said, and will confer with the officers of the Senate with regard
to his proposal. I will also bring it to the
attention of the Government.
We -are all highly appreciative of the splendid address delivered yesterday by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). It is an important document, and
should be very helpful in making clear
Canada's position within the Empire. It also
should be of assistance to the delegates who
attend the conference.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Anticipating the
desire of honourable senators, I have already
ordered the printing of five hundred extra
copies of yesterday's Senate Debates. These
are now in the Clerk's office and are available
te honourable senators. I have also given
instructions that this issue of the Debates be
translated into French without delay.

SENATE

94

At this time I might suggest to honourable
senators the expediency of publishing a
pamphlet containing all the speeches which
have been made in this Chamber on the subject of the San Francisco conference. Such a
publication, I am sure, would be of interest to
all attending the conference, and would constitute a valuable reference book.
Hon. Mr. MACLENNAN: I should like
to make what I think is a better suggestionthat we conscript the honourable senator (Hon.
Mr. Farris) and send him to San Francisco
in an advisory capacity.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
4 p.m.

THE LATE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
TRIBUTES

TO

ITS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators. I
think it fitting that at this time we should
for a few moments turn our thoughts to the
passing of the President of the United States,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The news of bis
death cast a gloom over the whole world and
affected men and women in every station of
life, from those of high estate to those in
humble circunstances.
President Roosevelt gave of lis best to his
country and to the world. At the time of bis
clection te the presidency in 1932 the world
was passing through a depression of unprecedented severity. We know how fearlessly he
tackled the grave financial, economie and
social problems which then confronted the
United States. Some of the proposals which
be put forward aroused a sharp division of
opinion among his countrymen, but they were
designed to case the burden of those who
depended on wages for their daily bread. At
his re-election in 1936 the international picture
had changed for the better, and bis domestic
policies had also brought about improved
conditions.
I believe it is generally conceded that he
foresaw more clearly than most statesmen the

and 1938, particuiarly bis famous Chicago

speech in which he strongly criticized the warl-ike policy of certain nations and suggested
that those nations be quarantined. But he was
too far in advance of public opinion in bis own
country, and did not receive the support which
The
the international situation warranted.
American people, lacking bis foresight, failed
to realize that we were on the threshold of
great and tragie events.
Honourable members will recall that during
that period he pledged bis country to come to
the support of Canada in, the event of invasion
by a foreign power. Throughout those years
be urged and encouraged the building up of
the military, naval and air forces of the
United States, so that they would be in a
position to exert their full strength in the
event of the country being forced into war.
We know how greatly he facilitated the war
effort of not only Canada but all the United
Nations during the present struggle. It seems
strange that one who did se much to consolidate what we now know as the peace-loving
nations should pass from the scene at this
time, when assured victory is within sight.
If I may, I should like to express to the
President of the United States, Mr. Truman,
and to the American people, our hope that the
present harnonious relations between us,
which we believe are of advantage to both
cotuntries. will continue. To Mrs. Roosevelt
and inemubers of the family I wish to convey
deepest sympathv in their loss. by death, of
this noble nan.
In the other House last evening the Prime
Minister, as leader of the Government, spoke
on behalf of Parliament and the nation as a
whole. He was followed by the leader of the
official Opposition and the leaders of other
groups in that House. I feel that the speeches
of the Prime Minister and of the leader of the
official Opposition are of such a character and
are so well expressed that it would be fitting to
have them reproduced in our own records. If
I had the talent of an elocutionist I would read
both speeches to the Senate, but knowing my
deficiency as a reader I will simply ask that
they be placed upon our Hansard.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, when word came to us yesterday tlhat the
President of the United States had passed on,
we all were affected as if we had lest a personal friend. I believe that throughout the
world there are more people mourning for
Franklin Delano Roosevelt than ever mourned
for any other man in history. That. no doubt.
is partly due to modern methods of communication, but it is also partly due to the
fact that in our heart of hearts we all believe
in humanity, and that in his actions President

Words fail me to express my thoughts.
Many people have perhaps wondered what it
would be like to live in a period when a great
man was on the stage of life. Those who read
everything they can find about Lincoln.. as
almost everybody does, must often try to
imagine what the ordiary man and woman of
his day thought about him. It has been said
that when he was living people did not regard
him very highly, that it was only afterwards
that bis greatness was revealed. I have never
been sure about that. It seems to me that
human beings can recognize true greatness at
the time of its existence. I do not think that
anyone who bas lived during the past twelve
years could have failed to realize that President
Roosevelt would go down in history as a great
man. It bas been a wonderful thing to see
this man, with all bis physical infirmities, so
outstand the rest of the world that for generations to come bis name will be a shining light
on the pages of history. Yesterday President
Roosevelt was a citizen of the United States;
to-day he is a citizen of the whole world.
That is not a new sentiment: it was said of
Lincoln, but I think it can be said with equal
truth of Roosevelt.
We in Canada do not always love the
President of the United States; but all of us,
from the highest to the most humble, loved
President Roosevelt.
Despite Hitler and
Mussolini and Togo, he seemed to say to us:
There is still hope for the world!
Mrs. Roosevelt is a great woman. No wife
could give greater support and encouragement
to lier husband than Mrs. Roosevelt gave to
the President, and' we sympathize with her
and her family in their grievous loss.
I join with the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. King) in wishing the
new President every success in carrying out
the policies of bis distinguished predecessor.
We share the sorrow of the people of the
United States. We Canadians are a peaceand-freedom-loving people, and we knew that
in the late President we had a powerful friend.
He will be numbered among the great statesmen of the world.
I fully agree with the proposal of the honourable leader opposite to incorporate in the
proceedings of the Senate the speechee which
the Prime Minister and the Leader of the
Opposition delivered in the other House
expressing Canada's appreciation of the late
President, and her sympathy with the people
of the United States in their loss-a loss not
nerely national but international.

95

May I say to the people of the United
States: We in Canada, as well as the rest of
the world, are under an eternal obligation to
your country for having produced such a
great man as Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
(The speeches of the Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Opposition are as follows):
Rt. Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING (Prime
Minister):. Honourable members have learned
of the death at Warm Springs, Georgia, this
afternoon, of the President of the United
States.' Franklin D. Roosevelt was so close and
good a neighbour, se great and true a friend
of the Canadian people. that the word when
received was as if one of our very own had
passed away.
I hasten to express on behalf of the Government, the members of both Houses of Parliament
iow in session, and on behalf of all the people
of Canada, our deepest sympathy with the
Government and people of the United States.
I wish at the same time to express our deepest
sympathy for Mrs. Roosevelt and all the members of the family in their bereavement. Their
sorrow and the sorrow of the American Nation
will be shared by the peoples of the United
Nations and by those who cherish freedom in
all parts of the world.
The death of President Roosevelt is in truth
a loss to the whole of mankind. Few lives have
been more closely identified with humanity in
its needs, its struggles and its aspirations. His
services to the cause of freedom went far beyond
limits of race and bounds of nationality. He
was an undaunted champion of the rights of
free men, and a mighty leader of the forces
of freedom in a world at war. He bas left
to the world an enduring heritage by what bis
life, his faith and his courage have contributed
to the well-being of bis fellow-men. It is a
comforting thought at this time to know that
before the close of his great career lie had
already helped to fashion the design of a world
organization for the maintenance of peace and
security. His rest at Warm Springs was in
preparation for the journey to San Francisco
to open the Conference of the United Nations.
In this conference lie envisaged the culmination
of bis life's great aim--an enduring peace among
the nations of the world.
It was my great privilege to have been a
lifelong friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt. I
knew him very well. Of that friendship I shall
hope to speak at another time. My feelings
at this moment are perhaps best expressed in
lines of Matthew Arnold. which perhaps J may
be permitted to quote. May I voice what at
this hour lies deepest in the hearts of all:
o strong soul, by what shore
Tarriest thou now? For that force,
Surely, bas not been left vain!
Somewhere, surely, afar,
In the sounding labour-house vast
Of being. is practised that strength,
Zealous, beneficent, firm!
I believe it is.
Mr. Speaker, as a mark of respect of our
country for the memory of the President, the
flag wili fly at half-mast from the Peace Tower
of our Parliament Buildings. As a further
mark of respect I know that all honourable
members would wish to have this House adjourn
without continuing its proceedings to-day, and
J move accordingly.

SENATE

the
(Leader of
GRAYDON
GORDoN
Mr.
Opposition): Mr. Speaker, to the suggestion
I believe the
with respect to adjournment
Prime Minister will have the unanimous consent
of this House. May I be permitted to associate
His Majesty's Loyal Opposition with the tribute
paid by the Prime Minister, and to say that the
news of the great President's tragic passing bas
left the members of this House filled with d.ismay
and weak with sorrow. The real significance of
his death at ene of the world's most critical
hours must ba left in some degree for future
times to assess. Measured by every yardstick
President Roosevelt's name will echo and re-echo
down through the world's hallways of fame as
one of the most dynamic, powerful and successful leaders that democracy has ever given to
the service of humanity.
He was enshrined in the hearts of every
freedom-loving man and woman the world over.
Millions of families to-night will feel the same
bitter twinge of sorrow they would feel at the
passing of one in their own family. President
Roosevelt was a fearless, courageous and happy
warrior. Whether he was battling against the
dread ravages of his paralyzing affliction or
fighting the good fight against political, economic
and social wrongs, lie never flinched, he never
faltered, he never wavered.
When it became bis task to throw his nation's
victorious
the temporarily
against
weight
aggressor nations in this global conflict, he
threw into that struggle every ounce of energy,
Likeeffort and determination be possessed.
wise in preparation for the equally compelling
objective of preserv ing and maintaiuing permanent peace and security in the world, the
late President was at the time of his death
engaged in the sanie vigorous and resolute march
to victory which had characterized his course
of action through these many years.
I witnessed the inaugural ceremonies three
months ago at the White House when Mr.
Roosevelt was sworn in for his fourth term iof
office as President of that great republie. Seldom
in my lifetime have I seen such genuine
demonstrations and sueh touching scenes as
when I looked over those many thousands who
had gathered to do homage to their wartime
President. One could feel that that great mass
of humanity was leaning heavily upon their
fellow citizen and President, with the profoundest conviction and confidence that the immediate future of their nation iras in the best hands
they knew.
This world can ill afford to lose President
Roosevelt as it emerges from this armed holocaust and enters the threshold of one of its
most critical periods. As he throws the torch
to other hands, let us pray that the relentless
pursuit of lasting peace shall be undertakei
with the same grim resolution and fortitude
which characterized every move he made.
Canada mourns to-night the loss of a great
friend and a good neighbour. Seldom bas a
president of our neighbouring republic to the
south been so close to the people of this nation.
Nowhere in the world will the sense of personal
loss be felt in a deeper way that in the homes
of the people of this Dominion. We are thinking
of Mrs. Roosevelt and the family as they walk
to-night through the valley of the shadow of
death. Canada desires to share their grief.
Language seems so weak and inadequate to
reveal one's feelings at a time like this I
suiimmnon to my help those immortal words:

Lives of great man all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time.
Those footprints will never be erased so long
as humanity reveres brave men who, in peace
and in war, are prepared to die that others
may live.

BUSINESS
STATEMENT

OF

OF PARLIAMEýNT
THE

PRIME

MINISTER

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
have been handed a statement which only a
few moments ago the Prime Minister made in
the other Chamber, and as it affects Parliament as a whole, I think it well to read it
to you. It is in these words:
This week, on Wednesday (April 11), I
reminded the House that if the business of
Parliament were not concluded before inidmight
on Monday of next week, this Parliament would
be automatically dissolved. I stated that at
no timne had I any thought or intention of
recommending dissolution with a view to shutting off discussion in the Hotse. I added that,
as honourable members well knewv, the sole
reason the Government had waited up ta the
last or almost the last day of the term iof
Parliament before going to the people lad been
our desire to avoid a general election while
the w ar in Europe was still in progress. I have
stated, over and over again, that the intention
of the Governient was not to dissolve Parliament if that could be avoided before the
decisive battles were fought in Europe. That
position was subject only to the limitation that
the people should not be denied the riglt
guaranteed to themi by the Constitution of electing a new Parliament at least every five years.
In a nation-wide broadcast on March 2. I
said: "Once the war in Europe is over, we feel
there should be a general election as soon as
possible."
On Monday (April 9) I gave to the House
an outline of the minimum timîîe which would
be required for a general election, and placed
on that
on Hansard an official memorandum
subject which had been given me by the Chief
That statemnent made it
Electoral Officer.
apparent that the earliest date at which a
general election could be held, following upon
the expiration of the parliamuentary terni, would
be June 11.
It rests with honourable members on the
Opposition benches, and here I am not referring
to any particular party or group but to all
honourable menubers opposed ta the Governiment,
whether the war appropriations and supply bills
will be ready for Royal Assent on Monday next.
My honourable friend. the Leader of the
Opposition, bas said that so far as members of
party are conthe Progressive-Conservative
cerned, they are prepared to ronciude the
debates in this Chanber at 6 o'clock this afterIntimations have also been given by
noon.
the leaders of the C.C.F. and of the Social
groups that they and their followers are
Credit
prepared to assist the Government in speedily
completing the business for w-hicli this session
bas been specially called.
Were it possible ta have the bills reach the
ather House this evening, that would permit of

APRIL 13, 1945
prorogation being arranged for Monday afternoon. (April 16) at 3 o'clock. If that cannot
be carried out, then the Blouse will of course
resume its sitting at 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon, to be continued, if need be, untjl il o'clock
at night. Were this to happen, without the
business being concluded and Royal Assent given
to the bis before midnight, the Government
would be obliged ta resort to Governor General's
warrants to meet expenditures both for the
conduct of the war and for civil government
over the period of the general election and the
opening of the new Parliament.
Now as to the completion of the business of
the present special session, as honourable members are aware, I stated some time ago that
a general election would be callcd before
April 17.
It may assist hoonurable members in deciding
upon the course it is, advisable in the public
interest for themn to pursue if 1 informa the
Blouse at once, on my responsibility as Prime
Minister, that Ris Exccllency the Governor
Gencral bas authorized me to say that he is
willing to approve a recommendation ta have
Parliament dissolved just as soon after the conclusion of its business as may be possible. His
lExcellency bas also au thorizcd me to say that be
is willing, at the same tinoc, to approve the
immediate issue of a Proclamation for the holding cf a general election on Jonc Il.
I am in doubt as to just what our procedure for the rest of the day should be, and
therefore will move that the Senate adjouru
during pleasure, to, resume at the cail of the
bell, probably at six o'clock. By that time
E»is Ilonour the Speaker may have information from Governinent House as ta whetber
the Royal Assent, wilI be given this evening.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
HFon. Mr. .KING: Honourable senators, I
am ladvised that there is stili some prospect
of certain. bills coming to us froin the other
House, andi would suggest that we again
adjK>ur during pleasure.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The a9itting of the Senate was resumeti.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
have ta report merely that it is the hope of
the Gorvernment that the two Bis now under
consideration in the other Chamnber will be
completed and sent to, us before il o'clock.
T-hat would give us an opportunity to deal
with them. this evening, and then I would
move that the Senate adjourn until Monday
at 2.45, s0 that at 3 o'clock we might have

Royal Assent and the Prorogation of Parlianment.
I now move- that the Senate adjourn during
pleasure, ta- resumne at the cail of the bell.

The Senate adjourneti during pleasure.

The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
WAR APPROPRIATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was receiveti from the House
of Commons with Bill 3, an Act for granting
ta Ris Mai esty aid for national defence and
security.
The Bill was rcad the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honoura:Ile
senators, when shahl this Bui be read the'
second time?
Hon. J. H. KING: I wouid move second
reading now. Briefly, the Bill provides that
out of the Consolidated Revenue Fond there
may be paid and applieti, beyond the ordinary
grants of Parliament, a som flot exceeding two
billion dollars, subjeet ta allotinent by the
Treasory Board, towards
defraying
any
expenses or making any ativances or boans
that may be incurreti or granted by or under
the authority of the Governor in Council
during the year ending March 31, 1946.
As is well understood, it is proposeti to
grant only five-twelfths of the war appropriation. The estimates are based on those of
the preceding year, and the items are virtually
the same.
I would suggest that the explanatory notes
which accompany the Bill should be placed
on Hansard.
(Th-e explanatory notes follow.)
Apart from the necessary changes ta make
this Bill accord with the changes in the amount
of the appropriation requestcd, and the changes
in dates, this Bill is in the saine form as that
of previous War Appropriation Bills, with the
two following exceptions:
(1) The preamble draws attention ta the fact
that the term. of the present Parliament wiIl
have ended on April 17 next, and that consequently an interim appropriation is necessary
ta, provide funds for the continuing prosecution
of the war until tbe next Parliament assembles;
and
(2) There bas been added a new paragraph
(d) in section two of the Bill.
It is intended that the funds to be provideti
under the Bill will be used for the purposes set
out in the War Appropriation Acts passed Iast
year, and in the War Appropriation (United
Nations Mutual Aid) Act 1943 as amended by
the War Appropriation (United Nations Mutual
Aid) Act 1944.
The amount of the appropriation requested is
baseti on the assomption that expenditures for
war and Mutual Aid wiIl continue during the
next llve months at approximately the saine
rate as during the hast five or six months..

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
ROYAL ASSENT--SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

The Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, the
Deputy of the Governor General, having come
and being seated at the foot of the Throne,
and the House of Oommons having been
summoned, and being come with their Speaker,
the Honourable the Deputy of the Governor
General was pleased to give the Royal Assent
to the following Bills:
An Act for granting to His Majesty aid for
national defence and security.
An Act for granting to His Majesty certain
sums of money for the public service of the
financial year ending the 31st March, 1946.
After which the Honourable the Deputy
of the Governor General was pleased to close
the Sixth Session of the Nineteenth Parliament of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be deeply gratified that the close of
the last session of this war Parliament comes
at a time when decisive battles against Germany
have been fought and won, at sea, in the air,
and on land; and when spectacular Allied
successes against Japan presage the defeat of
our enemies in Asia, as well as in Europe.
All Canada has watched with ever increasing
pride the contribution Canadian forces have
made toward ultimate victory.
I am particularly pleased that my leave-taking
of honourable members of the present Parliament comes at a moment when both Houses
have endorsed the acceptance by the Government of the invitation to Canada to send representatives to the United Nations conference at
San Francisco which opens on the 25th of this
month.
It is indeed gratifying that the Canadian
delegation has been assured of the strong support
of both Houses of Parliament in a determined
effort to further the creation of -an international
organization to maintain peace and security in
the post-war world. Next to the winning of the
war, the winning of the peace is the supreme
end to be achieved.
As the promise of peace dawns, a shadow bas
been cast athwart the threshhold of the San
Francisco conference by the passing of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. In the general acceptance of
a charter for an international security organization the late President foresaw the realization

32289-71

of a great hope: an enduring peace through
co-operative action on the part of all nations.
His life and work helped to impart that vision
to others. The deliberations of the conference
wi'il now be inspired by his indomitaible spirit.
In the death of Franklin Roosevelt, Canada
moures the loss of a true friend and a good
neighbour; the oppressed peoples of the earth, a
valiant champion; and mankind, a mighty leader
of the forces of freedom.
Members of the House of Commons:
My Ministers have consistently taken the nosition that the people should be secured in their
rights under the Constitution to elect representatives to the House of Commons at least
every five years, and that, subject to this limitation, any question as to the time of a general
election should be viewed in the light of what
Canada owes to her fighting men. My Ministers
have also felt that, once decisive battles had
been fought, a general election should be beld
as soon as possible. They are deeply gratified
that it is now possible to hold a general election:
at a time more favourable than any hitherto,
to a careful consideration by members of the
armed forces, as well as by citizens generally;
of the problems which relate to Canada' future.
The most ample provision bas been made for the
exercise of the franchise by members of the
armed forces in all parts of the world.
The term of the present Parliament will
expire at midnight to-night. On the advice of
the Prime Minister, I shall approve a recommendation to have Parliament dissolved at the
conclusion of this afternoon's proceedings. I
shall also approve the issue, immediately thereafter, of a Proclamation for the holding of a
general election on June Il.
I thank you for having made the necessary
financial provision for the effective eonduct of
the war, and for meeting the ordinary expenses
of government required to bridge over the period
between the beginning of the present fiscal year
and the opening of a new Parliament following
the general election.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The people of Canada as a nation welcome.
to-day the opportunity to express profoundý
gratitude to Almighty God for the deliverance
from evil fqrces w;hich in His Providence we
now see is being vouchsafed to peoples of our
own and other countries which our enemies have

sought to conquer and enslave. As this Parliament ends, we join in humble and reverent
thanksgiving to God for His Mercy thus
revealed to our own and other freedom-ioving
lands.
