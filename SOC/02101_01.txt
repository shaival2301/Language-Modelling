THE SPEAKER OF THE SENATE
FELICITATIONS ON HIS APPOINTMENT

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: I welcome
this opportunity to extend to you, Mr.
Speaker, the heartiest congratulations of your
colleagues on this side of the house on your
appointment to the eminent and honourable
position of Speaker of the Senate.
You, sir, bring to this high office great
qualities of heart and mind. You have long
held a prominent position in the business and
professional life of your native province. For
ten years you have been a member of the
Senate, and since 1945 have presided over
the deliberations of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. I do not need

SENATE
to remind the house that during the period
in which you acted as chairman of that committee there was before it a large volume of
legislation, much of it involved and some of
it highly controversial. In each case the
deliberations were carried on in a spirit and
manner in keeping with the best traditions
of the Senate of Canada; the consideration
was thorough and the conclusion arrived at
was sound. This was due in no small
measure to your skill, patience and unfailing
courtesy. There is, I believe, complete confidence on the part of all that these qualities
which you possess to such a remarkable
degree will serve you well in the discharge of
the responsibilities of the high office to which
you have attained.
May I add a personal word? Your term
of office as chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee approximates mine as
government leader in the Senate. You know,
sir, how often I have been compelled to lean
on you for counsel and advice, which was at
all times willingly and cheerfully given. I
thank you for it, and wish you well.
As Speaker of the Senate, you are following a long line of distinguished public men,
not the least of whom is the honourable
senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
who has just preceded you. We believe, Mr.
Speaker, that you also will bring additional
honour to this high office, and I assure you
that in the discharge of your duties you will
have the loyal support and fullest co-operation of your colleagues.
(Translation):

Hon. Lucien Moraud: Mr. Speaker, in the
absence of the leader of the opposition, I
have the perilous honour and, at the same
time, the most enjoyable duty, of agreeing
with what the leader of the government has
just now so aptly said of you.
Before becoming a member of this house
you were already a credit to the profession
to which we both belong you were also a
credit to your province; and since your
appointment to the Senate, the dignity and
broadness of mind with which you have
presided over the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce have been a subject
of pride to all of use.
May I repeat that I did not expect to second
the motion of the leader of the governrment.
I nmust apologize for doing it in such an
unsatisfactory manner. Nevertheless, it gives
me great pleasure to tell you that you are the
ideal successor of one who, before you, presided over this house with so much dignity.
You also, I am sure, will discharge the duties
of your office with much ability and prestige.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, as
the retiring Speaker, may I concur in the

remarks of the two leaders, and extend to
my successor, the Honourable the Speaker,
my best wishes and hopes for his pleasure
and enjoyment in the high and distinguished
office which he now holds.
Hon. Paul-Henri Bouffard: Mr. Speaker,
I take pleasure in offering you, on behalf of
my colleagues of this house, my most sincere
congratulations.
Senator Beauregard has been known to me
for many years indeed. I knew him as a
lawyer, and I am aware of the services which
he has for so long rendered the Liberal party.
I knew him also as chairman of the standing
committee on banking and commerce; in all
spheres, he has been an example for all his
fellow-lawyers as well as for all those who
took part in the debates of this house.
It is not only an honour but also a welldeserved reward for us, French-Canadians,
to have a member of our race as Speaker of
the Senate. I wish to congratulate Senator
Beauregard again, and to repeat, at the very
opening of this new Parliament, that he has
always set in every sphere an example which
we, who have had the privilege of knowing
him and the good fortune of associating with
him, have endeavoured to follow.
I congratulate him for the prestige which
his appointment will bring us as I feel certain
that, as Speaker of the Senate, he will remain
a model to us.
(Text):

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable members, as you may understand, I am too deeply
moved to acknowledge as I should the
remarks that have been made by the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
by the acting leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Moraud) and the greetings of other honourable senators. All I can say to my colleagues at this time, and I say it from the
bottom of my heart, is "Thank you".
(Translation):

Honourable senators, I do not wish to miss
this opportunity of acknowledging briefly the
flattering remarks which you were kind
enough to make about my career up to this
time.
I wish to thank particularly my colleagues

of the Bar for their gracious attention in
recalling our professional relations.

I feel very grateful to His Excellency for
my promotion as Speaker of the Senate, in
which capacity I shall always strive to follow

the tradition and example of my distinguished
predecessors.

I thank you.

(Text):

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SECOND SITTING
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber
and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the First
Session of the Twenty-First Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
There has been deep satisfaction in all parts of
the country that the steady improvement in the
health of the King has enabled His Majesty te
resume most of his customary activities.

The opening of the twenty-first parliament is
marked by the presence for the first time of the
representatives of the new province of Newfoundland. It is a pleasure for me te welcome their
participation in the national affairs of a greater
Canada.
With the admission of the new province of Newfoundland the Canadian nation attained the geographical limits planned by the Fathers of Confederation. Yeu will be asked at the present session
te approve measures designed te facilitate the
attainment of the constitutional limits of our nationhood. Te this end, a bill will be introduced te amend
the Supreme Court Act se that the Supreme Court
of Canada will become the final court of appeal for
Canada.
Yeu will also be asked te approve addresses praying the Parliament of the United Kingdom te vest
in the Parliament of Canada the right te amend the
constitution of Canada in relation te matters net
coming within the jurisdiction of the legislatures
of the provinces nor affecting the constitutional
rights and privileges of the provinces or existing
rights and privileges with respect te education or
the use of the English and French languages.
My ministers will seek te arrange for early consultation with the provincial governments with a
view te agreeing upon an appropriate procedure
for making within Canada such other amendments
te the constitution as may from time te time be
required.
The hopes held four years ago for world peace
and security under the aegis of the United Nations
have net yet been realized. The menace of Communist totalitarianism continues te threaten the
aspirations of men of good will. It is, however,
gratifying that the North Atlantic Treaty has been
brought into effect and is already proving its worth
in lessening the risks of armed aggression.
The defence needs of Canada, both as a separate
nation and as a signatory of this Treaty are being
kept constantly under review. Good progress bas
been made in the co-ordination and unification of
our armed forces and conditions of service are
being improved. Special attention is being given
te research and development intended te provide
the forces with the most modern equipment suitable
for present requirements.
A measure will be introduced te consolidate the
legislation respecting the defence forces and the
Department of National Defence.
It is the view of my ministers that the economic
health and stability of the nations of the North
Atlantic community must be the real foundation
of their ability te resist and, therefore, te deter
aggression.
Although the nations of Western Europe have
made substantial progress towards recovery from
the ravages of war, they have net yet been able te
restore completely their economic strength. Their
shortage of dollars continues, and international
trade remains in a state of unbalance. The government is seeking by all appropriate means te ceoperate in measures te restore economic equilibrium.
The achievement of a pattern of world trade in
which the trading nations can operate together
within one single multilateral system continues te
be the ultimate aim of my government.
Since parliament last met the International Wheat
Agreement has come into operation. The agreement together with the other arrangements made
te dispose of our surplus agricultural products will
provide additional economic security for many of
our farmers.
At home we continue te enjoy prosperity. Agricultural production generally continues to be high.
Private capital investment and employment have
remained at high levels. Relations between enployers and employees have, with few exceptions,
been satisfactory.

SENATE
As a result of legislation passed at the last session
of Parliament, new agreements with respect to old
age pensions have been completed with nine of the
provinces, and increased pensions have now been
made available to the aged and the blind in those
provinces. The completion of a similar agreement
with the Province of Newfoundland awaits the
enactment of the required provincial legislation.
The continued co-operation of the provinces in
the implementation of the national health programme has resulted in further progress being made
towards the desired objective of improved health
facilities and services for the people in all parts of
Canada.
While more housing units are being built this
year than ever before, the demand for housing
continues. Following discussions with the governments of the provinces your approval will be sought
for legislation to broaden the scope of the National
Housing Act.
A bill to provide for the continuance of functions
now vested in the Department of Reconstruction
and Supply, including the ministerial responsibility
for the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
will be placed before you for your approval.
You will also he asked to approve a measure to
enable the government to assist in the provision of
a transcontinental highway.
The government has concluded new air agreements with the United Kingdom and the United
States. The agreements provide new routes for our
international air services to the United States and
to the Orient, and additional traffic stops in
United States and United Kingdom territory for our
present international services on the North Atlantic,
to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific.
Measures demanding your consideration will
include a Bill respecting a National Trade Mark
and True Labelling; a Bill respecting Forest Conservation; a Bill to incorporate the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation; a Bill respecting assistance to the shipbuilding industry and
merchant shipping; a Bill to extend the life of the
Export and Import Permits Act; and bills to amend
the Exchequer Court Act, the Industrial Development Bank Act, the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, the
Customs Act, and the Veterans' Land Act of 1942.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for the
The
public service for the current fiscal year.
budget resolutions introduced at the Last Session
of Parliament will be submitted for your approval
and the enactment of the appropriate legislation.

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons.
I pray that Divine Providence may bless your
deliberations.

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire.

Selection to nominate senators to serve on the
several standing committees during the present
session; and to report with all convenient speed
the names of the senators so nominated.

He said: I would ask the indulgence of the
bouse in order that this motion may receive
unanimous consent and be passed today. If
this is done, the Committee of Selection can
meet tomorrow morning, and it is hoped that
its report will be available tomorrow afternoon. It could then stand till Thursday, when,
if the bouse approves, organization meetings

THE LATE SENATORS

MURDOCK

AND

MACKENZIE
TRIBUTES

TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I regret to have to say that it is my
responsibility officially to bring to your notice
the fact that since we last met we have lost
two of our most prominent and esteemed
colleagues.
The late Senator Murdock was born on
August 15, 1871 at Brighton, England, the
son of James Murdock and Annie Campbell,
his wife, both of Scottish descent, and with
them came to Canada in 1876.
After attending public school at Tilbury
East, Ontario, he entered the service of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, being employed
as a trainman from 1890 to 1905. Early in
his career with the railway Senator Murdock
became interested in labour matters. His
interest and ability were soon recognized,
and in 1905 he was elected Vice-President of
the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, an
office in which he served until 1921.
Senator Murdock's first political activity
came during the general election of 1921, and
upon the formation of the King Government
in that year he was appointed Minister of

Labour, whereupon he resigned the VicePresidency of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen. He was elected to the House of
Commons by acclamation in Kent County,
Ontario, on January 22, 1922. In 1925 Senator
Murdock resigned from the King Cabinet
and returned to his post as Vice-President of
the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, an
office which he continued to hold until 1933.
On March 20, 1930, he was summoned to
this chamber.
In addition to Senator Murdock's other
service in the public life of this country and
his association with organized labour, from
September 29, 1919 to June 24, 1920, he was
a commissioner on the Board of Commerce
and, as Minister of Labour, he acted as
Canadian Government delegate to the International Labour Conference at Geneva from
October 18 to November 3, 1922.
Senator Murdock is survived by his widow,
the former Annette Follis of Toronto, whom
he married in 1903, and by one son, R. H.
Murdock of Windsor, Ontario, and one
daughter, Mrs. DaCosta.
I think it is fair to say that perhaps the
outstanding characteristic of the late Senator
Murdock was his passionate advocacy of the
cause of all whom he deemed to be underprivileged, or the less fortunate. Invariably
those in need found in him a stout champion;
he reacted instantly to what to him seemed
to be an injustice.
He was a tireless worker and constant
attendant in the committees of this house.
He was always alert to the rights of minorities, and those groups were assured of a
constant and able champion when he was
present. The official reports of the Debates
of the Senate bear witness to his active
participation and interest in all matters which
came before the Senate for consideration.
The Right Honourable Senator Ian Mackenzie, Vancouver Centre, died September 2,
1949. Senator Mackenzie was born at Assynt,
Scotland, on July 27, 1890. He was the son
of George Mackenzie and his wife, Anne
Macrae, both Scottish. Born in poor circumstances, Senator Mackenzie, by his great
ability and high endeavour, educated himself and became one of the most notable
scholars of his day. Throughout his scholastic career, he won many gold medals and
scholarships. Upon graduating with highest
distinction from Edinburgh University in
1910, he won a Carnegie scholarship under
which he did valuable work on old Irish
manuscripts. Two years later he came to
Vancouver as a young lawyer.
In 1915 he joined Vancouver's famed 72nd
Seaforth Highlanders, with whom he served
with distinction overseas. Immediately on his
return from overseas he became interested in

SEPTEMBER 20, 1949
the aff airs of veterans, and in 1920 was
elected president of the Vancouver Command
of Great War Veterans. In the same year he
was elected to the provincial house as member for Vancouver. He was re-elected to
that house in 1924 and again in 1928, and in
the latter year was named provincial
secretary.
It was in 1930 that Senator Mackenzie
began his eighteen years as the representative
of Vancouver in the House of Commons. He
resigned from the British Columbia legislature to accept an appointment as Minister of
Immigration in Mackenzie King's government, and was elected in the general elections
of 1930. On October 23, 1935, he was sworn
in as Minister of National Defence in the
new Mackenzie King government, and in
1939 he was appointed Minister of Pensions
and National Health, a portfolio which he
held until 1944, when he was appointed
Minister of Veterans Affairs. This position
was one to which he was well suited by
reason of his many years of keen interest
and participation in the cause of veterans.
He was created a member of the Imperial
Privy Council in 1947, and was appointed
to this house on January 19, 1948.
In 1948 Senator Mackenzie returned to his
native Scotland to receive an honorary degree
from Edinburgh University. It was fitting
that he should be honoured by a university
to which he had brought great credit, and in
the land of his birth, which for him had such
a fond attraction.
The passing of Ian Mackenzie removes
from this house and the public life of Canada
a colourful and interesting figure. He was
great in mind, heart, and statute, loyal and
warm in his friendships; passionate and fluent
of speech. His personality impressed all
with whom he came in contact. He typified
the land of his birth and was intensely
attached to it, yet he enthusiastically
embraced and became a part of the land of
his adoption.
As I pay my respects there come to my
memory stories of his boyhood, of his trudging
along lonely roads in the Highlands in the
pursuit of an education, a quest that in due
course was to be rewarded with the highest
academic honours.
I first saw him twenty years ago. He was
presiding, as Chieftain, at a Scottish banquet,
with the honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duf) opposite him as his gillie.
He was proposing the toast to Scotland, standing on a chair and table, his eyes flashing,
his speech flowing like a torrent, his arm
upraised, his hand holding the glass. Then
came the climax: there was a dramatic pause,
and the glass was thrown to the floor, as was
the custom in bygone years in his native land.

In the House of Commons he enjoyed a
long and distinguished career. Vigorous in
debate, he asked no quarter and gave none;
yet friend and foe were curiously attached
to him. His warm heart and his generous
nature endeared him to all, and he will be
sorely missed in the Halls of Parliament,
where for so long he was such a familiar
figure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
have listened with very great interest to the
tributes jùst paid by the honourable leader
of the government. I speak first of Senator
Murdock, whom I cannot help referring to
as Jim Murdock. That is the name by which
he was known all over Canada and in railroad circles throughout the United States.
When I had the pleasure of meeting him for
the first time as a member of this house I did
not form a very high opinion of him, but
later through the years he did me the great
honour of inviting me to his home, and ever
afterwards I liked Jim Murdock. He could
say anything he wished, he could do anything
he wished, but I still liked him.
He represented the under-dog, or at least
he thought he did, and he could put the
views of the under-dog before us in no uncertain terms. That touch in his speeches was
good for all of us. We shall miss him, and
the house will be poorer by reason of his
passing. We none of us have a permanent
lease on life, and his time to leave us had
come. We honour his name.
It seems to me that if you want to know
something about a married man you should
find out what kind of a wife he has. Jim
Murdock had a wonderful woman as a life
companion, and to her especially, on my own
behalf and on behalf of those associated with
me, I wish to convey our deepest sympathy.
To his daughter and his grandson I want to
pass on some idea of the respect that we in
this house learned to have for Jim Murdock.
I did not have the pleasure of knowing his
son, but on behalf of my party here I wish
to say to all that we will miss Jim Murdock
in the years to come.
Honourable senators, now may I say a few
words about the late senator from Vancouver
Centre (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie)? Ian
Mackenzie was a magnificent representative
of the Highland Scots. He had that intense
fervour that we so often find among the
Highland people. They are as different from
the Lowland Scots as the Irish are from the
English. One would never guess they came
from the same country. The late senator had
all the eloquence and mysticism of his people,
and he was able to convey his feelings to an
audience.
Senator Mackenzie was with us in this
chamber only a short time. He came here

SENATE
from the other place where he was a very
prominent and important figure. I can quite
understand his feeling of restraint in this
house when we did not want to move too fast.
I sympathized with him particularly because
I remembered that when I came from the
Manitoba Legislature, where I at least thought
I was a fighting unit, and tried to put on a
fight here, nobody listened to me. I think my
friend Ian Mackenzie had the same experience. He was trying to break out of bounds
and get things going.
The widow of the late senator is a young
woman from my home city, whose great
ability was highly regarded by the company
with whom she was employed before she
married. I assure her we will long remember
her late lamented husband, and we wish her
happiness in the future years.
Hon. J. W. deB. Farris: Honourable senators, I endorse all that has been said by the
two leaders in this house and I wish to add
a special word in tribute to my very old
friend Ian Mackenzie.
After thirteen years in this house it seems
to me more inevitable each year that as we
come back and have the pleasure of renewing our acquaintances and meeting old
friends, the occasion is saddened by the loss
of some who are no longer here. I have in
mind particularly two senators from Vancouver who were the most outstanding and
dynamic men we have had from any part of
Canada. One was Irish, the other Scotch.
Honourable senators all know to whom I
refer-Gerry McGeer and Ian Mackenzie. We,
in our short wisdom, would think both these
men died too soon. They died in the prime
and full bloom of their manhood. They were
both spectacular, and could always make the
headlines; but they also had an earnest zeal
and desire to give public service.
I knew the late Ian Mackenzie very intimately for thirty-five years. It is that long
since he came to Canada from Scotland, a
young man freshly graduated from Edinburgh
University with about as high honours and
as fine a scholastic record as anyone from
that great institution. Hardly had he settled
in Vancouver where he intended to practice
law, when the First Great War broke out
and he enlisted in the Seaforth Highlanders.
Whether in peace or war Ian Mackenzie was
always at home where there was a fight; his
record at the front was characteristic; on
more than one occasion be was mentioned in
dispatches.
At the conclusion of hostilities my late
colleague returned to Vancouver and again
undertook the difficult task of establishing a
law practice in that new city. Then came the
provincial election of 1920. At that time I was
Attorney-General of British Columbia, and we

in the government had our eye on Ian
Mackenzie. With the permission of the house
I will quote from a speech he made three
years ago at a big dinner we gave him in
Vancouver. He said:
"Against my will and after three days argument
with him I was dragooned into being a candidate
by such a forceful and plausbile advocate as my
good friend Wallace Farris, now Senator Farris.

I think I did dragoon him into being a candidate, but he has never held it against me.
Certainly the people of Canada, and more
particularly those of British Columbia, have
good reason to be grateful that the late senator was induced at that time to come into
public life.
Ian Mackenzie was elected, and it is
remarkable to note that for twenty-seven
years he represented Vancouver and was
never defeated. I can speak rather feelingly
in that respect, because I ran in six elections
there and got elected three times.
In 1930 my late friend was invited by Mr.
Mackenzie King to join his government, and
he became a minister for a short time. That
government was defeated, but Senator Mackenzie defeated that redoubtable fighter
Harry Stevens. He came back to Ottawa, and
for five years was a member of a small group
which led a fight against his personal friend
Mr. R. B. Bennett. He was one of the stalwart
leaders in the opposition during that period.
When the King government was returned
to power Ian Mackenzie was made Minister

of National Defence. I speak now of things
that happened when I first came to the
Senate. At that time Ian would come over to
my room and talk about his troubles in the
other place. He wanted the government to
vote $200 million for national defence purposes; in this he failed, but he did succeed in
getting the appropriation increased from $35
million to $60 million. Perhaps it can be told
now that Ian Mackenzie at that time considered resigning from the government. I
think he was right in taking the larger view
of the problem and remaining. It would have
been better if we had spent more money on
defence at that time, but a government in
matters of this kind can go only as far as
public sentiment will permit it to go.
After the Second World War broke out Ian
Mackenzie was made Minister for Pensions
and National Health. That department was
soon merged with the department in which
he really belonged, that of Veterans Affairs.
There he enjoyed his greatest success in
administration. I know that the watchword
he gave to all associated with him was: "When
in doubt lean backwards in favour of the
veterans". There is in Canada a composite
group of statutes known as the "Veterans
Charter", of which competent authority has

SEPTEMBER 20, 1949
said that it was the world's greatest legislation achievement for the benefit of the exservice man. Ian Mackenzie did not create
that charter, but his enthusiasm and energy
and the inspiration of his leadership contributed much to it.
Hospitals were one of his greatest interests.
Only within the last week I read that in the
opinion of the British Empire Service League
delegation, Sunnybrook Hospital at Toronto,
to which he gave a great deal of attention, is
the finest hospital for veterans in the Empire.
I would like to supplement what my leader
has said regarding the idealism of the late
Senator Mackenzie. He had the characteristics of the Highland Scot. He was a great
scholar. He was a master of the English
language, although we did not realize that
sometimes, or in moments of excitement his
Scottish intonation was so pronounced that
one had to make an effort to follow him. He
had a great capacity-I know many will
vouch for this-for friendship and for personal loyalty. He was impulsive and aggressive, but he never held a grudge, and to my
knowledge he never said a mean thing about
an opponent. He had the Scottish characteristic of being a great lover of freedom. If
honourable senators have not read it, I commend to their attention the speech he made in
May of 1947 in the House of Commons on
"Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms".
It was an inspiring speech, eloquently
delivered, and it contains a great deal that
is worthy of our remembrance.
Lastly, he had a deep love of country. I
have read a bound selection of his speeches,
and I should like to end my remarks about
him with a quotation from one of his
addresses, made at a St. Andrew's Society
dinner. After having discussed the bonds
which unite us, he said this:
Such then is our common bond, native born and
Scottish born. We are members of the same nation,
the same Empire; we have the saine background of
history, the same love of liberty, regard for authority, and belief in justice. I love the glens of
Scotland where my fathers sleep. I love the heather
in all its purple glory. I love the corries and the
glens and lochs of the old homeland; every hill
with its heroic tradition, every stream with its
story, every valley with its song.
My home is in Canada, my duties and responsibilities are in Canada. "I was a stranger, and ye
took me in."
My blood brothers sleep in Canadian soil, one in
the plains of the great northwest, the other in a
soldier's plot in British Columbia. I love this great
generous Dominion of Canada, with its decent and
its dauntless people. Here I shall be proud to live;
here, when the call comes, would I die, for, great
as Scotland is to me and to youThere is no land like our land,
God keep it ever so,
And heart throbs shall be drum beats
When we find our Country's foe.
Oh this may love the Southland,
And that may cross the Sea.
But this land is our Land, and Canada for me.

Honourable senators, Canada is the poorer
for the loss of Ian Mackenzie.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators, as
a Canadian and a member of parliament I
ask the privilege of saying a few words of
sympathy to the relatives both of Senator
Murdock and Senator Mackenzie; and coming
from British Columbia as I do, I would
address a particular word of condolence to the
widow and other relatives of Ian Mackenzie,
the senator from that province who has just
passed away. As bas already been pointed
out, he not only rendered excellent parliamentary service in the provincial and federal
fields, but he did a magnificent work for
veterans of the first and the second world
wars, and for the relatives of those Canadian
soldiers who did not return. I am sure that
his widow will accept this tribute to him in
recognition of what he did for the widows
and relatives of other Canadian veterans.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, because of my long association with
Senator Murdock, and the admiration which
I have always felt for him, I would like to
say a word of tribute to his memory and of
sympathy to his relatives.
I first met Senator Murdock as long as
thirty years ago, when he was a member of
the Board of Commerce and I was counsel
for the Government of Ontario in the prosecution of the alleged wholesale grocers'
combine. It was during those long and very
intense proceedings that I came to admire this
senator whose loss we now mourn. He was,
above all things, amazingly vigorous. He had
a tremendous flow of oratory. As our leader
has said, he was invariably on the side of the
under dog; he always responded readily to
appeals to justice, decency and humanity. It
was because of his association with organized
labour that I was drawn to him.
In the years that have intervened we have
had some common interests, and in many
respects a common outlook which led to
rather close associations. In 1945, when I
became a member of this house, I was
placed, naturally and rightly, on the Committee on Immigration and Labour. As honourable senators will recollect, that committee, of which the late senator was chairman, undertook very important work in connection with immigration problems affecting
Canada. I had the advantage and the
pleasure of working closely with him in the
course of those proceedings, and there I
formed a still greater attachment to, and a
stronger liking for, Senator Murdock. To
repeat a phrase which has already been used,
the bouse is poorer for his absence. I feel
that I personally am poorer for his absence.
I was sorry when he relinquished the chairmanship of our committee, and I think I

SENATE

express the opinion of all its members when
I say that we shall sorely miss his presence
in our sessions in the years to come.
May I join with the leader and others in
conveying my deepest sympathy to his relatives, and the hope that they will glory in his
past rather than grieve at his departure. This
house is the poorer for the loss of Senator
Murdock.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
although I did not know the late Senator
Mackenzie for as long a period as bas the
senior senator from my province (Hon. Mr.
Farris), I knew him very well for the last
fifteen years, and it is my desire te add a
word to express my feeling of loss in his
passing.
You have heard his public record and,
while there are those who are aware of some
of the fine things he did, no one will ever
know all the good he did for his fellow men,
but we shall all feel poorer for having lost
him.
Our sympathy goes out to his widow. She
and the late senator had only been married
a short time; but their association was very
close, and she did much to make his life comfortable during that period.
All Canada, not just British Columbia, has
lost a man who has left his touch on the
public life of this country. His first love in
public life was the House of Commons, and
no honourable member of that chamber
studied its rules of procedure more assiduously or was more devoted to its service than
the late senator. The Honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) expressed
it very well when he said that Senator Mackenzie felt restrained when he came to this
house. He did not get the action here that
he had been used to in the other place; nevertheless he continued to strive for the good of
his fellow men. He continued to work for
the returned soldiers, his comrades of the
First World War and those who served in
the last war. Knowing how arduously Senator Mackenzie worked for the betterment of
his fellow men, I think his devotion to public
duty is best summed up in a story I heard
about a small girl. She was carrying her
brother down the road and was asked by a
man, "Won't you let me carry that boy for
you? He must be very heavy for you." Her
reply was, "He is not a heavy load, he is my
brother."
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the First Session of
the Twenty-First Parliament of Canada.

(Translation):
Hon. Joseph Adélard Godbout moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight of the
Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order
of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion of
the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, upon
whom has been conferred the Decoration of the
Military Cross, one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp
General, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief
in and over Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your Excellency has
addressed to both houses of parliament.

He said:
Honourable senators, it is a real pleasure
for me to move the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne, and the personality
of the man who presides over our debates
adds to my enjoyment. I have known His
Honour the Speaker in the province of which
both of us are native sons and have had an
opportunity to follow his political, professional
and social career. Without revealing any
embarrassing secret, I may say that it was
under his aegis, as it were, that I entered
politics. I wish to assure him that I will
respect the general principles which he has
instilled into me, and that I will abide by
those same principles whenever he gives a
ruling, as Speaker of this house, in regard to
the rules of the Senate. I wish to assure him,
further, that I will co-operate with all my
colleagues in the best interests of our country,
and follow the example set by our distinguished Speaker.
I also wish to thank the leader of the government for welcoming me to this house, and
for the honour which he has conferred upon
me by asking me to move the Address.
It is gratifying for me to point out the entry
for the first time into the Senate and the
House of Commons of representatives of a new
Canadian province, namely, Newfoundland.
This province brings us not only its physical
resources but, what is more important, its
moral values and the co-operation of its
industrious people. I am sure that they will
have no difficulty in adopting the principles
of Canadian policy.
The Newfoundlanders are welcome to
Canada, their representatives are welcome to
the Senate, and I am proud to be associated
with one of them in proposing the Address
in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.
May I be permitted to recall to your
memory the names of the two deceased sena-

SEPTEMBER 20, 1949
tors just mentioned, whom I had not the
honour to know as well as most of you did.
I particularly wish to pay tribute to the
memory of Honourable Senator Beaubien, my
predecessor. The senator who represented
the division which I now have the honour of
representing was a gentleman, a man of great
culture and a keen business man. I would
like to imitate his straightforwardness and
his broadness of mind in the discussion of all
prdblems, not only in this house, but whereever he was called upon to express an
opinion.
Honourable senators, to propose the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne is always a delicate matter when a
man is new to his surroundings. It is both
an honour and a pleasure for me to do so
this year, because-and the case is rather rare
in political history-the Speech from the
Throne corresponds exactly to the programme
proposed by the government during an
electoral campaign.
As I see it, I am not expected to pay tribute
to the efforts of the government or to its
leaders, but rather to remind the people of
Canada that they must co-operate faithfully
and loyally with the men who direct the
public life of their country in the common
interest.
Democracy is in danger in several parts of
the world, where an effort is being made to
instil subversive ideas. The best way of
meeting this danger is to command the
respect of the people and, by so doing, to
make them respect democracy.
The Speech from the Throne touches on all
the aspects of Canadian life. It forecasts
laws designed above all to defend our territory. I am not a soldier. I do not want war
and I do not believe that Canada wants it;
but war is sometimes forced upon us, and
today, as in the ages gone by, the surest way
-of avoiding it is to unite and to command
respect. As I mentioned a moment ago,
subversive ideas spring from the mind of a
people who are conducting their affairs in
such a way as to extend their power beyond
their own frontiers. It is these ideas which
they wish to impose upon all the countries of
the world. Canadians will not stand for this.
We have had the lesson of the last war, and
the road to peace is furnishing more lessons
of the same kind. This should be a warning
to us should war break out one day. It is
surely our duty ta avoid war, and the government should give serious consideration to this
problem and develop true patriotism. Let us
prepare reasonably and strongly; let us incur
today the necessary expenses and see that
they are met by our own generation, in order
to ensure for our sons tomorrow the stability,

the security and the happiness which we have
enjoyed ourselves.
To make our country and all of North
America secure, it will be necessary to
organize, not only from the military standpoint, but also and perhaps particularly from
an economie standpoint. The North Atlantic
Pact may well safeguard, at least for a time,
our boundaries, our military security. I am
personally convinced that the North Atlantic
Pact has dampened the ambitious dreams
of certain people who need not be mentioned.
We all know them. But the Marshall plan
will probably come to an end in a few
years, and I fear that several signatory
countries will have to get themselves out
of their financial difficulties. We will have
to help them, and at our own expense.
I am sure that all the public men of
Canada accept this principle and I am also
convinced that they will help in the quest
for means to restore the economic equilibrium
of the world, in our own hemisphere particularly, in order to protect North America
and to ensure peace.
I also rejoice in the knowledge that the
government of my country wishes to help in
securing the peace of the world through social
security, and more particularly to ensure
social security within its own boundaries.
I am not partial to socialism; I favour
private enterprise, which I consider absolutely necessary to our economic progress.
But if private enterprise is to continue to
prosper, and in order that it may ensure the
economic consolidation of the country, it will
be necessary to look into our social legislation. To ensure social security to-morrow, it
will first be necessary to obtain the services
of each and every one in his own profession,
and to place all talents at the country's disposal. Every man must have the means of
earning a livelihood. But to earn one's living
is not only to earn one's daily bread, but also
to contribute the best of one's mind and
heart to the country's welfare. The political
and economic history of my country is a
witness to the fact that, in all fields of human
endeavour, the people who have received an
education through the kindness of a sister, an
uncle or an old parish priest, have placed all
their talents at the disposal of their country.
My colleagues are no doubt aware, as I am
myself, that there are people in our country
who, had they not been given an opportunity
to continue their studies, could never have
become outstanding members of their profession or have contributed as they did,
materially and morally, to the life of Canada.
As this type of personal benevolence no
longer exists, the state will have to step in,
to a certain extent, and help the larger and
poorer families to develop the talents and

SENATE
moral assets of their children, and thereby
safeguard their future. My reason for favouring these social measures is.not only that they
provide the poorer familles with bread, but
also that they will endow Canada with
enormous wealth and contribute towards
making it one of the greatest countries of the
world. We need experts to develop our
resources. We lack technicians and, we will
have to train hundreds of them to develop
the national resources of our country. Personally, I should like to see our own native
sons take advantage of the facilities to be
provided in order to enter these higher fields.
For a while yet we will have to call upon
technicians of other countries-and they are
most welcome here because they will help to
develop our own assets-but I would like to
see the sons of our Canadian soil prepared for
the task of contributing to the material and
moral greatneess of our country.
In addition to a good education, the people
must enjoy good health to achieve this end.
If we examine the statistics on the health of
our country, we find that the population is
healthy in mind in spite of living conditions
that are still very primitive. I would like to
ask my honourable colleagues to look over
the health statistics more often. They will
see how many people are in hospital and
other institutions and how many will be
dependent on the state for the rest of their
lives. Many of those people could have
been an asset to the country instead of a
liability! As has already been stated by the
prime minister, the federal government
should intervene, not in order to supplant
the provinces but to supplement their action.
It is a duty which I would like the government to fulfil. It is necessary for the government to give financial help to the provinces
in order to promote the rapid development
of education, especially from a technical
point of view. We need a great number of
technicians to develop the resources of our
country, and some provinces at least cannot
cope with the task. With due respect for the
supremacy of the provinces in the field of
education, there should be no opposition,
under the false pretence of autonomy, to the
federal government giving them the necessary material help. Obviously this co-operation cannot go so far as to interfere in the
choice or amendment of educational systems,
but a way should be found to provide the
necessary financial help without encroaching
upon provincial rights. I shall cordially
endorse any plan to provide such help to the
provinces, not by interfering but by providing the necessary help, first for education and
then for public health.
Honourable senators, I do not wish at this
moment to hold your attention much longer.

I will have the opportunity of discussing
these matters later on. I am neither an
alarmist nor a pessimist. I am rather an
optimist by nature. I have confidence in my
colleagues, in the future and in my country,
but I cannot but point out that there is now
in the world and in this country a trend of
thought which frightens me.
The people seem to think that agriculture,
in Canada as well as elsewhere, is so prosperous that the farmer lives like a king
because of the abundance of food which he
enjoys. This is true to a certain extent
in the case of a few specialized farmers, but
not for all the farmers in Canada. If the
value of agricultural products increased
during and after the war, on the other hand,
in many cases the cost of production increased
much more. Taking into account the farm
machinery which the farmer must keep and
improve and his tremendous expenses, I am
convinced that unless a greater effort is made
by governments to promote the farmer's
welfare, there will be a depression in this
field. There are people in some countries
who suffer the pangs of hunger. Farmers,
therefore, must be encouraged to produce in
greater quantities. However, they are reluctant to incur the expenses necessary to do
this, and tomorrow, perhaps, we may have to
feed hungry mouths. Honourable senators, in
1960, the world population will have increased
by 200 million. It means for one thing that we
will require 350 billion gallons more milk
than what we produce today. Now, what
is the situation of the dairy industry in Canada? Dairy cattle are shipped to the United
States on account of the higher prices which
our farmers get there. I do not wish to sound
the alarm but to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation.
I note that the Speech from the Throne forecasts some legislation to enable the federal
parliament to amend the constitution. I
repeat that I am an autonomist, not because
I took part in the political life of a particular
province before becoming a member of this
honourable house, but because I believe that
only through strong provinces will we be
able to build a strong country. If we grant
autonomy to the provinces, how can we refuse
the government of this country the same
privileges? I am glad to see that Canada has
made gigantic strides towards autonomy and
economic sovereignty. Canada will make
equal progress on the road towards judicial
sovereignty. The country must be completely
free to amend its constitution. This is a
delicate matter which some may be surprised
to see me touch upon, but it is a matter
regarding which I do not think I need be
afraid to express my views.
I have confidence in Canadians, in all
Canadians. There are no territorial barriers

SEPTEMBER 20, 1949
and I see no differences between the races
and beliefs of our population to prevent us
from co-operating in making our country a
great country. Why then should we not provide in our very constitution the means of
amending it as new problems arise? The
various legislatures of our provinces are
asked at every session to amend the charters
of from ten to twenty towns. If it is necessary to change charters of our cities and
towns, how can we avoid changes also in
provincial as well as federal legislation, whilst
safeguarding the rights and privileges which
no person wants to give up or dreams of
losing? I am talking of the right to speak our
lani,,age, uut i nave in mind all our rights.
I would like to see assured to us all rights
which the constitution guarantees, some of
which the prime minister has had the courage
to admit were not guaranteed. Before all my
colleagues of this honourable house and before
all the public men of Canada, I want to
express the opinion that the French language
should be recognized in the whole countrynot only in the federal Parliament and in the
province of Quebec, but also in all the provinces of the Canadian confederation. Our
fathers were good Canadian citizens. They
laid the foundations of the country's civilization, and I cannot understand why the right
to speak their language should not be recognized in every part of Canada. There are
French Canadians in Canada, and they are
here to stay. We must live together as
brothers. Let us therefore join hands with
greater confidence and keep before our eyes
the picture of a Canada free from barriers
between provinces and frorn divisions between
racial groups. We will thereby ensure, in
the true interest of Canada, the stability
and expansion of our economic development.

Honourable senators, will you allow me to
tell you how privileged I feel at being permitted to participate in the debates of the
Senate of my country, and, much more, in
being a colleague of every present member
of this honourable assembly.
I come here with as little prejudice as
I could bring with me, my mind open to the
study of every problem concerning the life,
prosperity and happiness of my country. In
the discharge of my duties I do not intend
to be what in French we call "brouillon"that is hasty and boisterous; rather, I think
it will be my duty, especially during this first
session, to listen, study and consider every
problem in the light of Canadian interests.
In my mind and in my soul Canada is not
divided by territorial interests, races or
creeds; it is a rich, happy, united and great
nation, to the future of which any citizen
45785-3

must be proud to devote, heartily and without
any reserve, all that he can contribute.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Ray Petten: Honourable senators,
there comes a time in the lives of some men
when they are called upon to perform a duty
which creates in them a profound and paradoxical sense of pride and humility. They
are proud because they are the instruments
chosen to perform a service of honour, but
humble because they realize the magnitude of
their responsibilities and, viewing themselves
impartially, are quite conscious of their limitations. So today I am aware of the great
honour that is mine, in that the privilege has
been granted me to second the motion so ably
presented by the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout), whose distinguished career has made his name familiar
even beyond the boundaries of our nation,
and has placed him amongst the foremost of
contemporary Canadian statesmen. He began
his career as an educator and carried the
principles of his profession into the wider
field of politics. His name is synonymous
with Canadian unity, which he did so much
to preserve and promote. It is also inspirational to hear him speak in his native language, which indicates how well the Canadian
nation protects the identity and traditions of
its units while providing the strength and
the greatness which union gives the whole.
I should like at this point to associate
myself with the honourable senator's congratulatory remarks to the distinguished senator for Rougemount (Hon. Elie Beauregard)
on his nomination as Speaker of this house.
His long experience in public life furnishes
ample reason for confidence in his ability
to discharge his high functions with dignity
and ease, thus successfully emulating the high
traditions of his predecessors.
I also wish to join with the proposer in
thanking the honourable leader for the way
he has received me in this house, and to say
how pleased I feel to assure him of our
co-operation in the work which be directs
with so much tact and diplomacy.
I would like honourable senators to know
that I realize that the privilege granted
me of speaking on the floor of this house
today is an honour to the province I represent
rather than a tribute to any merits which I
myself may possess. This knowledge adds to
the already weighty responsibilities of my
task, for the manner in which I discharge it
will redound, whether for good or ill, not
on me alone, but on the land of my birth, that
honourable island of venerable history which
now is a part of that proud confederacy of
progressive peoples, the great nation of
Canada. I am also fully aware that in this

SENATE
chamber I stand amongst some of the most
distinguished of Canada's senior statesmen,
men whose voices carry weight in the councils
of the world, and whose worth has been
proven on a stage of great vastness and
scope. I could wish that an abler representative of Newfoundland were in my place
today; but I know that the honourable senators; with their well-known kindliness and
courtesy, will exercise tolerance and forbearance, and I am confident that I can rely upon
the sympathetic understanding of my fellow
Newfoundlanders who soberly realize the
importance of the momentous events which
have made recent history.
This is an occasion which will live forever
in the history of Canada, and particularly in
the records of the tenth province, for since
the Senate last opened, this country bas
grown in area and in population, and the
representatives of ten provinces, instead of
nine, meet here in solemn conclave today.
Newfoundlanders heard with great pleasure
the welcome which the Governor General
gave us in the Speech from the Throne, and
it was a great day for all concerned when the
oldest British colony and the youngest
dominion became the newest province.
Truly, Canada today stretches from sea to
sea. When I first entered this building which
houses the Parliament of Canada, I read with
emotion and pride the inscription which is
chiselled above the main entrance, "The
wholesome sea is at ber gates, ber gates both
east and west". In imagination and with
heartfelt sincerity, may I be permitted to
stand by the sea on the easternmost tip of
Newfoundland, and across our broad and
spacious land extend the hand of fellowship
to my brother citizens who live beside the
shores of the broad Pacific? And then, for a
moment which would be immortal, I would
see all the vastness that is Canada-its rich
and fertile land, its energetic and devoted
people, its solidarity and its progressbounded on both sides by the wealth and the
walls of two mighty oceans. Truly, honourable sirs, this is a great and glorious land, a
nation which is reaching ahead to grasp and
secure the future, whose position of power
and pride is permanent. It is a solid land, a
lasting land, and its record of sober achievement and steady growth is in itself the best
assurance of its greater future prosperity. It
is a land where faith in the future is justified
by the works of the past.
Those honourable senators who are aware
of the fact that the decision of Newfoundland
to join with Canada was taken by a rather
small majority of the Newfoundland people,
may be interested to know some of the factors
which influenced public thought on this issue.
Confederation first became a public issue at

a general election in 1869. The political party
which introduced it was badly beaten, and
for more than eighty years nobody dared to
risk political extinction by raising the question again.
To understand their antipathy to confederation, let us take a superficial glance at the
people of Newfoundland during the four and
a half centuries in which they have lived on
the island. It was the hope of liberty and
freedom which, from the very beginning
caused them to leave their homeland and
make the difficult and dangerous voyage
across the almost unknown Atlantic. They
wanted personal freedom; they wanted to be
rid of the restrictions and injustices of Tudor
and Stuart England. They were prepared to
pay a heavy price for that freedom in the
wild lands and on the wilder seas of a practically unknown country. They established
themselves in many hamlets along the coastline, and began to wrest a living from its
waters and rugged soil. The coastline extends
roughly about 6,000 miles, and now comprises
upwards of 13,000 settlements. It was a wild
and rugged life and only the fit and determined could survive, but it gave them a freedom which was almost absolute. However,
they were not for long allowed to enjoy their
freedom in peace. The long arm of the west
country merchants, backed by ignorant and
often dishonest officials in England, reached
out to suppress them, to destroy their homes
and to exterminate them as a colony.
Throughout most of its history, their country
and their rights have been pawns in the
hands of outsiders who have had no regard
for the interests of the people.
With such a background, is it surprising
that through the centuries there had grown
amongst the people an almost fanatical desire
to keep their isolation at all costs. External
associations had brought them nothing but
injustice and spoilation, and even death. The
hand of the outsider had only been raised to
plunder, fine and imprison, and to destroy
their homes and drive them into the wilderness. They had secured responsible government with great difficulty only a few years
before, and their greatest desire was to be
left alone. They feared political associations
with anyone because of the bitter experience
of the past.
But the world at large was moving much

national and international relations were taking place. Recent years had seen a revolution in the methods of production and of
international trade. Our country was completely dependent upon foreign markets; our
fortunes fluctuated with theirs. To them we

modern world began to impress upon the
people the new maxim that the day of the
small nation was over. We began to look
around for a partner with whom union would
be mutually advantageous, and we looked to
the west. There we stood, right at the very
gates of Canada, a great nation and a member of the British Commonwealth, whose
traditions and political principles were almost
identical with our own. So representatives
from Newfoundland sat down with Canada's
government and worked out terms of union
which some months ago were approved by
the people and which made the completion of
Canada a fact.
Honourable senators, I am very pleased to
be able to report at this time that if a referendum on the question of confederation were
taken in Newfoundland today, the vote would
show that well over ninety per cent of the
electorate was for union.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Petten: There remains in Newfoundland today only a very insignificant and
fast-dwindling faction in opposition to confederation. A very definite proof of this was
evident recently when the people of the island
gave an overwhelming welcome to His Excellency the Governor General. The warmth of
the greeting, and the widespread enthusiasm
with which he was met everywhere, furnished
abundant evidence of the attitude of the
people of the tenth province toward the union
which made them part of this great and vigorous nation. And again I need not remind
honourable senators of the tempestuous reception given to the Prime Minister of Canada
when he visited the new province some weeks
ago. The Right Honourable the Prime Minister was greeted by great throngs of enthusiastic people who were eager to welcome the
great Liberal statesman with the warmth and
hospitality for which they are noted. Thousands of those who turned out to welcome His
Excellency and the Prime Minister were
citizens who had voted and worked against
union with Canada.
It was prophesied by the present premier
of Newfoundland more than a year ago that
Newfoundland would quickly become the
happiest of all the provinces composing the
union, and that prophecy is already on the
way to fulfilment. The people are determined
to give confederation a chance to work, and
there is no doubt that it is already working.
To many of you Newfoundland is still a
strange country, and it is too early to expect
that the problems peculiar to the new province should be familiar to you. Despite the
fact that but a few miles of water separate
the island from the mainland, there is much
45785-31

about this new part of Canada of which
Canadians as a whole know very little.
Ours is a beautiful land, its climate and
its scenery varying greatly. The perfect calm
and mirrored quietude of long bays and
sounds that reach inland for many miles in
Bonavista and Trinity Bays, and the peaceful
islands which make Notre Dame Bay a veritable paradise where trees thickly cover the
hills down to the water's edge, contrast
sharply with the bold rocky capes and headlands which in naked cruelty jut out into the
stormy North Atlantic. The raw weather of
the east coast is balanced by the finer, drier
The

storms of winter and long spring find compensation in a summer which, if rather brief,
provides some of the finest weather imaginable, with hot sunlight tempered by wholesome sea breezes. In this setting of natural
resources the sportsman finds his Eden, with
the wary salmon waiting to be outwitted and
a plentitude of large trout eager to fight the
angler; while inland the lordly moose and
fleet caribou roam the picturesque and scenic
barrens.
The addition of Newfoundland to the rest
of Canada brought another area of surpassing
beauty to a great land already world famous
for the diversity and excellence of its magnificient scenery.
Newfoundland's three major industries are
the fisheries, the manufacture of pulp and
paper, and mining. The fisheries, Newfoundland's chief source of wealth, have during
recent years been undergoing some-shall I
say-improvement. The erection of large
freezing plants for the processing of fresh
fish has been considerable, and its effect on
the economy of the island has been extremely
beneficial. But it was the salt codfish industry in the beginning which caused the colonization of the island, and which remains the
most important factor in Newfoundland's
economy.
This industry is divided into three main
branches: the inshore fishery, the bank fishery, and the Labrador fishery. The inshore
fishery is conducted with small boats manned
by fishermen who, with traps and trawl, fish
in the waters a few miles from the settlements in which they live. In the bank fishery,
which is probably the best known of the
three branches, fairly large schooners are
used: they sail out to sea on the Grand Banks,
and fish for cod in the deep waters. These
vessels make several trips per year. The
Labrador fishery also requires the use of
schooners, considerably smaller than those
used in the bank fishery. These outfit-in the
late spring and fish along the Labrador coast
during the summer, returning home with
their summer's catch of salt cod in the early
fall.

SENATE
Most of the fish caught is cured by the
fishermen themselves. By and large the Newfoundland salt cod fishery is conducted in the
same way that it was generations ago-and
here I would like to say how necessary it is
that steps be taken to modernize the industry
if it is to survive and adequately support
those engaged in it. The record of the industry is not good, despite the hard work, the
effort, and the back-breaking labour pursued
under conditions which are often not only
extremely uncomfortable but very dangerous.
The fisherman engaged in this industry usually has nothing to show for a lifetime of
effort but a worn-out and tired spirit.
Recently there has been a growing acceptance of the fact that ways of improving the
industry are already within our grasp. Two
sound and practical suggestions have been
made which, if pursued, will unquestionably
vastly improve the industry within a few
years. One calls for an alteration in the
methods of inshore fishery; the other would
revolutionize the method of cure. At the
present time, as I have stated, small boats
are used for the inshore fishery. This means
that fishing can only be carried on in good
weather. Our summers are brief, and smooth
water is somewhat rare in early spring and
late fall. Thus the amount of time the fisherman has in which to do his work is definitely
limited. Again, small boats are restricting the
quantity caught. Larger boats will supply
the answer. Boats big enough and stout
enough to withstand stormy seas, and with
sufficient power to bring them in safely
against heavy winds, would be able to go
farther off shore, to spend days, if necessary,
away from the home port, and to return
when loaded. These boats would permit the
fishermen to begin operations very early in
the year and continue up until the year's end.
Bigger boats and a longer season would
greatly increase the catch per man per year,
and thus bring greater prosperity to the people and the province. Already some experiments have been made, and the results have
been gratifying.
The curing of salt codfish has been a
vexatious problem. The old method must be
discarded. At the present time fishermen
cure their own fish, with the result that a
uniform product is impossible. Further, the
flisherman must spend much time curing his
fish when he ought to be catching more. The
answer to this is obvious. Central curing
stations must be established to which fishermen could bring their ilsh as soon as it is
caught. The plant will look after the matter
of curing while the fishermen continue to
catch. The matter of artifical drying, particularly in the early stages of curing., must
receive attention also, and must be arranged

in

conjunction

with

these

central

curing

stations. The fresh fish industry has proven
the value of buying fish fresh from the fishermen. People who do not have to cure their
fish have more time at the fishery and
generally appear to be more prosperous than
those who salt and cure their fish.
Despite the fact that the codfish industry
has been carried on continuously for four
hundred and fifty years, too little is known
regarding the fishing grounds off our coast,
the location of banks, and so forth. It seems
to me that the time has arrived when a
thorough investigation along scientific lines
should be undertaken to make certain of the
existence, location and dimensions of the
many sections of the ocean within fifty to one
hundred and fifty miles of our northeast
coast, and that some scheme should be

evolved under which such areas can be exploited to the advantage of the men whose
severely circumscribed operations today make
it difficult to gather a harvest that will afford
them the type of livelihood to which they
are entitled.
Before I leave the fisheries I would make
brief reference te the seal fishing, which
early each spring prov ides an industry that
for adventure, romance and colour, is uneoualled in the annals of commerce. The
ig game hunter mees nothing in the realm
of sport to excel the danger and the excitment
of killing seals on the heaving icefloes of
Newfoundland waters.
The m-ills at Corner Brook and Grand Falls,
te
former the largest in the world, employ
'Lhousancls of people in the manufacture of
n'evsprint and sulphite, and other thousands
in cutting the wood which is necessary to
feed the mills. The value of this industry
runs into many millions of dollars and is a
vital factor in the island's economy.
Mining is centered largely at Bell Island
an Buchans. The iron ore from the former
remains in good demand and is smelted in
the mills of North Sydney.
Honourable senators, it was with great
pleasure that I noticed the reference in the
Speech from the Throne to the Trans-Canada
highway. For many years Newfoundlanders
have keenily desired to have a trans-insular
road extending from St. John's to Port aux
Basques. Now it appears as if their dream
of decades is about to b realized. This road
xvil not only open up the interior of the
province, but will be a great step forward in
building up a tourist business in Newfoundlind. If confederation accompilished nothing
else for our island, the building of the transinsular road 'ould make it worth while, for
the Trans Canoda bighway will cross the
i-land of Nlewfoundland.
It will extend
from St. John's to Victoria, or-if the honour-

SEPTEMBER 20, 1949
able gentlemen from British Columbia prefer
it-from Victoria to St. John's. Isolation with
all its stultifying consequences has been a
strong deterrent to our progress, I dare say
this applies to other parts of Canada as
well. When isolation is banished individual
happiness and a broader culture inevitably
follows. Therefore, it is with intense interest
that the proposed-Trans-Canada highway is
visualized by our people. Newfoundland will
remain an island, but its insularity will
disappear.
I would not be speaking truly if I gave the
impression that Newfoundland is going to
judge the wisdom of uniting with Canada by
the selfish yardstick of what she gets out
of the union. Our Newfoundland people have
a strong pride, and the last thing they want
is to be regarded as a burden on the rest of
Canada. It is true that our long night of
isolation held us in check and left us, by
comparison with some of the other provinces,
weak and backward. We cannot as yet offer
that contribution to the union which we
should like to make, but that will come. We
are determined to place ourselves in a position so that we may be able to contribute
substantially to the union whose benefits we
share.
We have very important natural resources
on the island of Newfoundland, and in the
vast territory of our Labrador. It has already
been made abundantly clear that this new
land, comparatively unknown until recent
years, contains enormous iron ore deposits,
huge forests and tremendous waterpower. It
is a virgin land and its potential value is
staggering in its concept. We want to see
these resources developed for the general good
of Canada, as well as for our own prosperity
as a province, and we believe that they will
be developed.

In addition to the natural resources which
exist in the waters around our coasts and in
our forests and mines, and in the military
advantage of our strategic position, Newfoundland has brought another asset to
Canada which, in the long run, may surpass
all others-I refer to the people, the Newfoundlanders themselves. Centuries of independent living in a rugged and often
forbidding country, where existence has
depended upon toil, ingenuity and endurance,
have produced a particularly hardy, selfreliant race. They have lived daily with danger on the sea, have endured the harshness
of Nature in its season, and have survived
the injustice of ancient wrongs. They are
today a courageous, imaginative, sensitive and
robust people who have learned sympathy
through distress, and hospitality through
frequent need' Their capacity for sacrifice
has been well established, and their loyalty
is unsurpassed anywhere in the world. Certainly when Newfoundland became part of
Canada these new Canadians, numbering
well over a quarter of a million people,
brought in themselves a priceless contribution, the value of which only time itself can
assess.
Honourable genators, it is a great honour
to have a seat in this chamber as a senator
of Canada and to participate in this debate;
but above all it is a great honour to be a
Canadian.

know that this house changes its members

SEPTEMBER 21, 1949
even more often than does the House of
Commons. For example, during the five
years when R. B. Bennett-later, Viscount
Bennett-was Prime Minister of Canada, he
filled thirty-three senatorial vacancies. I
believe the records wrn show that approximately one-third of the personnel of the
Senate changes, on the average, every five
years. I am not one of the senior members,
though I am rapidly approaching that position after only some fourteen or fifteen years.
When I was appointed I was No. 93 on the
roll; now I am No. 24. That change in my
position of seniority here does not take
account of a considerable number of senators
24 in all-who were appointed
-perhaps
after me and who have since died.
I repeat, we welcome you new members.
You are bringing with you here the new
spirit of Canada. We will give you every
assistance. There is only one thing we would
say to you: you are here, not as Liberals,
but as Canadians, and we hope that in considering questions you will forget politics
and think only of the welfare of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Duff: You bet!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I say that because each of
you, like the rest of us here, has a very
high responsibility, resulting from life
appointment to this great national legislative
body. The world is facing new issues all
the time. We thought that at the conclusion
of the war our really serious problems would
be solved, but they seem to be increasing in
number every year. I am sure all our new
members realize that for the remainder of
their lives they will hold the destinies of our
country in their hands. It is a heavy
responsibility.
Just a word on another point. I have
often been asked how the leader of the
opposition chooses his deputy leader and his
whips. People say to me, "You have such a
small group that you do not need much
assistance in the way of deputy leader and
whips." I sometimes take the trouble to
point out a little secret: If you have a kicker
in your party, put him in a job and he will
change to a booster and friend. Well, you
can look around you now and see why certain members have been chosen for honourable positions.
Sone Hon. Members: Oh, Oh!
Hon. Mr. Haig: Here is another point. The
leader of the government in the Senate is
chosen by the Senate, but the leader of the
opposition is chosen by his own supporters.
Once the leader of the opposition gets into
office he cannot be put out except at a caucus,
and he is the only one who can call a caucus.
So I am not going out of office for a day or
two.

Now let me deal with the Speech from the
Throne. The first thing that strikes me about
the speech is that it gives very little information as to the government's legislative program. True, it does propose abolition of
appeals to the Privy Council, amendments to
the British North America Act, and government assistance in housing and the construction of the trans-Canada highway. Considerable reference is made to other legislation,
but there is little indication of its character.
The Speech from the Throne does not say
much concerning the proposed legislation to
abolish appeals to the Privy Council, but the
bills have been distributed, and we can read
them. As to the intended amendments to
the British North America Act, the government merely says that it is asking for legislation permitting it to deal with that part of
the act which affects federal matters. I suppose a conference with the provinces would
follow. The Speech from the Throne gives
little indication of the form the new legislation will take. Therefore, if I do not devote
much time to it in my remarks, honourable
senators will understand why.
First I shall deal with the question of the
abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. I
do not wish to refer to what has been said
in another place, but speaking personally, and
on behalf of the party I represent, I feel that
the proper place for final appeal is the
Supreme Court of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Canadian Bar Association, in convention recently at Banff, recognized some of the difficulties consequent with
this change in procedure. Before dealing with
the attitude of that convention, I want to
say that I believe 90 per cent of Canadian
lawyers are in favour of the proposed change.
One reason for this, of course, is that we
want to show the world that we are an independent nation; but the real reason from the
lawyer's standpoint is ·that wealthy corporations have the means to go to the Privy
Council, whereas poorer litigants have not.
The history of the Province of Ontario tells
us that at least once a year for many years
one of its former premiers, Sir Oliver Mowat,
went to England to appear before the Privy
Council on questions in which provincial
jurisdiction came into conflict with federal
jurisdiction; and in nearly every case his
appeal was successful. I repeat, that 90 per
cent of the lawyers in this country-probably
99 per cent-are in favour of making the
Supreme Court of Canada the court of final
appeal.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The percentage is too
high.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Certainly it is 90 per cent.
May I read to the house an extract from the
proceedings of the Canadian Bar Association
convention dealing with this question? It
is as follows:
Whereas the Government of Canada has announced its intention to introduce legislation at the
next session of the Parliament of Canada, providing
for the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council
and making the Supreme Court of Canada our final
Court of Appeal in all matters,
Be it resolved that the Canadian Bar Association,
without expressing any view as to the wisdom or
otherwise of the proposed abolition, is of the
opinion:
(i) That any bill for the abolition of the Privy
Council appeal should contain the necessary provisions as to the organization and jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the system by which its judges
will be appointed.

That should be clearly set out.
That sufficient time be given before the statute is
enacted to permit the public to give consideration,
both as to the question whether the abolition of the
appeal to the Privy Council should take place and
to the constitution and powers of the court that
may replace it and also-

I emphasize this.
-to the effect which the abolition may have upon
provincial and minority rights.

The association goes on to suggest what
should be done if the appeal is abolished.
Probably I should read the remainder of the
resolution.
(ii) If, as and when the appeal should be
abolished, it is the opinion of this association as at
present advised:
(a) that the Supreme Court should consist of nine
judges.

I believe that the present bill so provides.
(b) That a quorum of the court should be five
judges;
(c) that it should sit always with an odd number
of judges present;
(d) that there should be no change in the present
practice of the court, under which each member is
free to give reasons for his judgment;
(e) that the court should continue to sit at Ottawa
only;
(f) that the salaries of the judges of the court
should be substantially increased so as to make such
salaries commensurate with the responsibilities of
the office, with an appropriate additional amount
to the Chief Justice;
(g) that the rule of stare decisis ought to continue
to be applied with respect to past decisions of the
court, as well as with respect to past decisions of
the Judicial Committee.

committee, either of the House of Commons
or of this chamber, to obtain the opinions of
leading lawyers, prominent business men,
representatives of labour and other organizations. We should also know at least in outline
how matters of provincial and minority rights
generally are to be dealt with. This subject
hooks in with the legislation to amend the
British North America Act. We should be
in a position to discuss the two measures
together, because they hang together. Some
people contend that the Parliament of Canada
has full power to do anything they deem
advisable. Others take the stand that the
provinces should be consulted. Admittedly
there are differences of opinion, and I am
certain that Canada cannot be kept united
unless on all these great questions the
provinces are consulted. I do not contend
that it is necessary to get their unanimous
consent. But let me remind you that the
constitution of the United States cannot be
amended except after a two-thirds vote of
the Senate and of the House of Representatives, as well as an affirmative vote of twothirds of the States.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You would not like that
system to apply, would you?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not saying what I
would like; I am saying that some provision
should be made to consult the provinces. I
am not now suggesting what that provision
should be. I do not believe I am competent
to do so; in any case I have not thought the
question through. But I do know that in all
human relations-and after all the provinces
are bodies of human beings in associationpeople get along better if they have an
opportunity to discuss issues among themselves. It is my experience as a practising
lawyer that, although a situation may seem
impossible, when you and the opposition
lawyer get together it is wonderful how many
differences you can iron out in conference
which could be composed in no other way.
In my opinion the provinces need for their
appellate purposes some tribunal other than
the Supreme Court. I say this with no disrespect to that court. In any event I am
sure that the provinces would be better satisfied and there would be more prospect of
unanimity if, concurrently with the consideration of this matter of appeals, they were consulted as to the amendment of the constitution.
Hon. Mr. Euler: All the provinces have
their representatives in this house.

It is with the first clause that I want to
deal.
Discussion of this question of appeals to
the Privy Council has been going on in
Canada for nearly eighty years. There was
agitation to end them even before there was
any disposition to change our colonial status.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that.
I do not believe that it would be in the
Hon. Mr. Euler: And in the other place.
interests of Canada to put through this legislation too hurriedly: there should be a lapse
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that too. But the
of time long enough to enable a parliamentary fact may as well be faced that in certain

SEPTEMBER 21, 1949
provinces the charge is made, though I do
not believe it is true, that the judges represent
the capitalist class and no other. I suppose
I cannot be assumed to represent any but
the capitalist class, because I believe in free
enterprise and am opposed to governmental
controls and government domination.
Take as an example the province of Manitoba. For years and years we had rows with
the Dominion Government over railway rates.
If that matter were now in issue, I would not
like to have the rights of Manitoba finally
disposed of by a court appointed in accordance with the proposed procedure. Remember, it has required judgment after judgment
of the Privy Council to determine the respective rights of Ontario and the Dominion.
Similar issues will arise again. I repeat
therefore, that in my opinion the bills dealing
with appeals and with constitutional amendments should be considered together, and I
think the Bar Association did wisely in inserting in the first part of its resolution that
consideration should be given "also to the
effect which the abolition may have upon
provincial and minority rights."
So much for the matter of appeals. We
shall deal, of course, with the bill when it
comes here. I cannot say anything about the
constitutional amendments, because I have no
indication as to what they will be. I do not
think much of the idea of giving parliament
the power to amend the British North
America Act in one particular and not in
another. Here again, a conference with the
provinces would be desirable. I do not suppose that in law anybody can maintain that
the Parliament of Canada is not supreme. I
admit that it can enact legislation dealing
with this matter, and that it would be
approved by the British Parliament; and the
provinces cannot demand as of right that a
conference be held; but if we are to have
peace and unity I think they will have to be
consulted. I support wholeheartedly the
views of the Canadian Bar Association on this
point as expressed in its resolution, which
puts the issue in a nutshell. The members of
the association did not consider the question
as supporters of any political party, and the
resolution, in my opinion, has no such
purpose.
The next item with which I will deal
briefly is the trans-Canada highway. Naturally, all of us are in favour of the construction
of this highway; but I suggest to the government that it has a very thorny and difficult
proposition on its hands. What I am about to
say is said without disrespect to, or in a
spirit of criticism of, any province. In this
matter each province is as important as any
other. But how can Saskatchewan be expected
to undertake a large part of the cost of build'5785-4

ing a highway across the province, some
four hundred-odd miles east and west, when
its natural traffic lines run north and south?
Does the Government of Canada expect the
people of Saskatchewan will be willing to
pay half or indeed any of the cost? I shall not
say anything about Manitoba because, owing
to the situation of our lakes and the distribution of our population, our main natural highway is east and west. As to British Columbia
I cannot speak with any authority. My
honourable colleague from Vancouver will tell
you that it is the richest province of Canada,
but I doubt whether British Columbia will
want to build a high-class road clear through
the mountains to the coast. It may do it, but it
will encounter difficulties. The same problem
is found in Northern Ontario. Once you leave
Sault Ste. Marie and travel west you pass
over hundreds of miles of rocky terrain. The
pulp and paper companies and other industries
do not require a trans-Canada highway,
because they use water for their transportation purposes.
The government has got to decide where
the highway is to be built. It has been suggested that this decision will be left to the
provinces. As far as Manitoba is concerned,
I do not think it would matter much whether
the highway ran straight west, or northwest,
from Yorkton; but perhaps the majority of
our people would want it to run to Regina
over the route now taken by No. 1 Highway.
However, whether it should continue from
there to Calgary, or run north through
Saskatoon to Edmonton, is a serious question.
The people of Edmonton will tell you that
within twenty-five years their city will be
one of the greatest in Canada, and they will
argue that the highway should pass through
that city.
Manitoba is anxious to see this highway
become a reality. I admit that the eastern
provinces have greater scenic possibilities
than the mid-west, but I believe that an allweather highway from Winnipeg to the coast
via Calgary or Edmonton, would develop our
tourist traffic immeasurably. We are therefore vitally interested in this project, and are
behind it wholeheartedly. I feel s.trongly that
the government should carry out the construction of this highway, because tourist
money is the easiest made and is our best
source of revenue. Now that the Canadian
dollar is at a ten per cent discount, the
American tourist trade will mean millions of
dollars to Canada.
I have not too much to say about housing.
The building program in Western Canada,
which will be completed by early spring, will
provide houses for those who can afford to
buy under present high costs. Our difficulty
is that accommodation is not being provided

SENATE
for our thousands of low-wage earners. These
are the people who should be considered
first. I shall repeat what I was criticized for
saying once before in this chamber, that the
federal and provincial governments have got
to give financial assistance to the municipalities to enable them to build housing accommodation for our low-paid workers. If this
is not done, legislation should be passed to
provide our workers with a basic wage which
will enable them to build or buy bouses at
present-day costs. The government may take
whatever horn of the dilemma it wishes; it
will have to take one or the other.
I turn now to the subject of old age pensions. I was hopeful that an amendment
would be introduced this year to provide for
two things. The first is that the pensioner
should be entitled to earn beyond his pension
of $40, without deduction therefrom, an
amount proportionate to the amount that he
was permitted to earn when the statutory
pension was $30 per month. I think the concession should be $120 per year. This may
not seem much to us, but it is important to
the old age pensioner. I realize that I do not
present the views of every member of my
party, but I think the means test should be
done away with. This may sound drastic, but
my experience as a lawyer has taught me
that the means test is most disagreeable to
Canadian men and women who, after spending a lifetime in this country, have lost their
savings in one way or another and are
obliged to apply for old age pensions. In
Manitoba we have found every case so clear
that the means test is not really necessary.
I must say to the gratification of my own
province, that the committee concerned has
always released the security. Just recently
an eighty-four year-old woman who owned
a one-third interest in eighty acres of land,
half of which was under cultivation, wanted
to give the property to her son. The government had a lien on the property, but when
I placed the facts before the committee the
land was released. The committee in Manitoba has followed this practice in every case.
There is nothing more I wish to say about
the Speech from the Throne.
Honourable senators, these past two weeks
have been important ones in world affairs.
The government financial leaders of Great
Britain, Canada and the United States met
in Washington and, as was stated in the
other chamber a few days ago, Canada's
delegate stood second to none in these deliberations. I say quite candidly that he did a
splendid job. A day or two following this
conference of financial experts, the international committee on the Atlantic Pact held
a meeting. Then, a few days later, there
was a meeting of the representatives of the

International Monetary Fund. Our delegates
occupied a difficult position at these meetings,
but I am sure we are all proud of the able
manner in which they represented Canada.
There is no use denying that Canadians
are bound to the Mother Country by ties of
sentiment. It is just as a man said to me the
other day, "If I were born in Sweden, Norway, France or Italy and came to this country
to live, I would not have the same sentimental
ties with Britain that a person from Scotland
or England would have." However, all those
who have come to Canada and lived here
for a lifetime have realized the contributions
Britain has made to the world. They have
realized how much Britain has contributed
to our system of government and our system
of justice. When Britain declared war on
Germany in 1939, though Canada did not have
to enter into hostilities, every member of this
house and all but two members of the other
house agreed that we should join Britain.
That was an indication of the deep affection
Canadians have for the Mother Country.
Britain has made mistakes. I think her
people made a mistake when they elected
their present government. But that is none
of my business. I think other people, too,
made mistakes when they elected their
governments.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Copp: That is not your fault either.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I just wanted to point out
that our representatives at these various
international conferences have had this rather
delicate situation with which to contend. I
have read everything I could about what
happened at these meetings, and I am convinced that we would all support the decisions
made by our representatives.
Britain bas devalued the pound much more
than I think anybody expected. Canada has
followed by devaluing her dollar, and just
here I want to pay a word of respect to my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck). I have always been in favour
of a ten per cent devaluation, and every time
I have spoken in this house on the Speech
from the Throne I have advocated this policy.
About three years ago my honourable friend
made such an able speech on the question of
devaluation that a year later I joined him in
advocating that we should let the dollar find
its own value. The dollar is a commodity on
the world market, just as is a bushel of wheat,
a bushel of potatoes, a case of salmon, a barrel of apples, or anything else that we sell.
The very fact that the government has
devalued the dollar on the market shows that
money is a commodity. As soon as Britain
reduced the market price of her currency
we did the same with ours, as did nearly all

SEPTEMBER 21, 1949
the countries of Europe; and that was done in
each case because the value of the currency
had gone down in relation to the value of
United States currency, which is accepted as
the base. I think it would have been better
for us if the government had not fixed a
definite price for our dollar, but had allowed
it to find its own price on the world's market;
because if the present rate of discount does
not accomplish the desired purpose there will
have to be a further discount, and every such
adjustment will become an increasingly difficult one. I say quite candidly that in my
judgment we should not have interfered with
the exchange rate in July 1946; we should
have held the dollar at 90 cents from that
time on. Now we are back to that rate.
These changes cause widespread interference with world trade. Just the day before
yesterday we read that Great Britain had concluded a deal with Czechoslovakia for the
purchase of lumber from that country. I do
not know anything about lumber, but I see
some lumbermen about me, and they will
understand how much harder it is going to be
to sell their products to Great Britain because
of this deal with Czechoslovakia. An honourable member-I believe it was the mover of
the address-said he believed in multilateral
trade. It is very well to say that, but how are
you going to get multilateral trade unless you
have a standard of currency acceptable to the
countries ready to trade with you? Look at
what happened to Britain. United States purchasers would not buy British goods because
they felt the pound was at too high a rate of
exchange in relation to the American dollar.
Anyway, I am glad that at last our government realized that the Canadian dollar had to
The government resisted
be devalued.
devaluation for a long time, and I know that
arguments can be made to support the resistance. We read these arguments every day.
We are being faced with the keenest trading competition in our history. A year from
the 31st of July the grain produced in my
part of the country will be sold on the open
market; it will still be handled by the pools,
but there will be no contracts. Honourable
members know that I have protested in this
house before about the price of $1.55 that was
set for our wheat sales to Britain, but I was
advised to wait and see what would happen
after the contracts had expired. The prediction was that Britain would want to continue
buying Canadian wheat. Well, do honourable
members think Britain will buy Canadian
wheat next year if she can make a deal to buy
more cheaply from the Argentine, or from
Russia or France? And in any event, how
could she buy from us if the United States,
which is putting up the money, insists that
American wheat be bought with it? That is
45785-4à

what the United States will insist on. The
question is, not what Britain wants to do, but
what she can do.
The government is going to run into heavy
losses next year in its trading operations. I
noticed a report that up to the 31st of March
last we had lost half a million dollars in the
buying and re-selling of fish. We cannot go
on buying fish, potatoes, cattle, hogs and so
on and selling them at a loss. Now the
government is buying butter. I direct this
particularly to the attention of the senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
Hon. Mr. Euler: Eat margarine.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The government is buying
up butter, and it will take a big loss before
it is through. Every time the government
goes into a commercial enterprise of this
kind it rides for a fall.
In my opinion the next three or four years
will be most difficult ones for Canada. Let
me say here, on behalf of those of us in the
Senate who belong to the Conservative party,
that we shall do everything we can to assist
the government in finding solutions for its
problems. We shall not indulge in carping
criticism of government action in dealing with
those problems. We realize that the world is
in a terrific turmoil. As has been said hundreds of times in this house and in another
place, the world today is divided between two
ideologies. The Atlantic Pact is a great help
to us, but we have tremendous burdens and
responsibilities. We are now an important
nation in world affairs, and there rests upon
us the duty of doing our utmost to protect
our own people and our wealth of resources.
We owe it to the United States to hold up
our end. That country is doing a magnificent
job, no matter what anybody may say to the
contrary, and it will do even better if it
knows that we are doing our best to help
out.
Honourable senators, if we want to get
the world back on its feet we have got to do
our share of the necessary work towards that
end. Think of the misery and destruction
caused by World War I. We used to feel that
nothing could be worse than what happened
back in those days; then we came to World
War II. A young man said to me: "I dropped
six tons of bombs on Cologne five times. I
was four miles up in the air when I said
'Bombs away!' I suppose a hundred persons
lost their lives because those two simple
words were spoken". Surely, honourable
senators, we do not want that kind of thing
to continue.
Let us forget our politics. When we think
the government has done something good, let
us commend it; and when we think it has
acted wrongly, let us say so, in firm but
friendly terms, and point out what we thlnk

SENATE

should have been done instead. If we work
together in this way we can make a contribution to this country's welfare that will
justify the existence of the Senate for another
century.
Honourable senators, I thank the house for
listening to me so long.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to proceed today
with the few remarks that I wish to make
in the debate on the Address, and within a
few minutes I shall move adjournment of
the debate. First, however, I wish to make
two statements for the information of the
house. Tomorrow afternoon I shall move
that the Senate adjourn until Tuesday evening next. J may say to new senators that
the question of whether we should adjourn
until Tuesday afternoon or evening is one
on which there has never been any unanimity of opinion here, and I have endeavoured
to bring the wisdom of Solomon to bear by
alternating between the afternoon and evening whenever circumstances permitted.
It is hoped that this session we shall be
able to complete our work on the Bankruptcy
bill, which has been before us the last two
sessions, and send it on in good time to
another place. A measure to consolidate
various Acts relating to national defence will
come before us. Though this measure may
not be discussed at length in this chamber,

it undoubtedly will take a good deal of the
time of the committees. The members of this
house possess considerable talent and experience, and I am sure it would be to our
benefit and that of the country at large if
as many honourable senators as possible
were to express their views in the debate on
the Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne. I invite all honourable senators to
participate in this debate. The quality of
the speeches we heard yesterday prompts me
to extend to senators recently appointed to
this chamber a special invitation to speak.
One senator asked me if it was a tradition
in this house that junior members should be
seen and not heard.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That may be the practice in the other place, but it certainly is not
so in this house. Whenever possible, I avail
myself of the opportunity to ask new members to participate in the proceedings. Tomorrow afternoon I shall speak for a short
time, after which any honourable senator
who wishes to do so may follow.
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow.

the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SUSPENSION OF RULES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, may I draw attention to the fact that
since yesterday, when I moved that the
Criminal Code bill be set down for second
reading on Tuesday next, I have been advised
that the bill is urgent, as it has a bearing on
Newfoundland's entry into confederation, and
it is desirable that it receive Royal Assent
by October 1. Under the circumstances I am
going to ask, with leave of the Senate, that
we proceed with second reading today, so as
to expedite its passage. I have arranged for
a thorough explanation of the bill this afternoon, and our Parliamentary Counsel advises
me that the matters with which it deals are
not likely to be controversial. Therefore I
move, with leave of the Senate:
That Rule 25 (b) be suspended; that the motion
passed by the Senate yesterday, "That Bill D, entitled an Act to amend the Criminal Code be placed
upon the Orders of the Day for second reading on
Tuesday next" be rescinded.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am in entire agreement with this proposal,
but I should like to make one suggestion to
the honourable leader of the house. It is that
when the bill receives second reading it be
referred to Committee of the Whole instead
of to a standing committee. A good many of
us who formerly served in provincial legislatures like to have bills dealt with in Committee of the Whole, because that procedure
gives every member a chance to ask questions
and enter into the discussion. I do not think
there is anything in the bill itself that would
require a reference to a standing committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am quite agreeable
to the suggestion of my honourable friend.
I might add that it would expedite passage
of the bill, because at present our standing
committees have not yet been set up.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, though this is an important bill it is a
simple one, containing only eight sections.
Seven of them deal with the relationship of
the Criminal Code as it now stands to Newfoundland, and the last section purports to
postpone the coming into force of new Part
XVI, as enacted in the Statutes of 1948. I
shall have something to say about that later.
I would point out first that sections 1 to 6
of the bill are for the purpose of relating to
Newfoundland the Criminal Code provisions
with respect to courts and magistrates, in
preparation for the day, which will be reasonably soon, when the Code is proclaimed as
part of the criminal law applicable to the
new province.
It will be recalled that last session we
passed an Act, which is Chapter 1 of the
Statutes of 1949, approving of the terms of
the agreement for union with Newfoundland.
Section 18 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada provides for the continuation of laws in force in Newfoundland,
until they are repealed, abolished or altered
by the Parliament of Canada or by the
legislature of the province of Newfoundland,
according to the authority of such bodies.
Subsection 2 of that section reads as follows:
Statutes of the Parliament of Canada in force at
the date of Union, or any part thereof, shall come
into force in the Province of Newfoundland on a
day or days to be fixed by Act of the Parliament
of Canada or by proclamation of the Governor
General in Council issued from time to time, and
any such proclamation may provide for the repeal
of any of the laws of Newfoundland that
(a) are of general application;
(b) relate to the same subject-matter as the
statute or part thereof so proclaimed; and
(c) could be repealed by the Parliament of Canada under paragraph one of this Term.

I think we can safely say that the Parliament of Canada contemplates proclaiming
within a reasonably short time that the
Criminal Code is the law of the Province of
Newfoundland. In preparation for that, we
must amend our definition sections and various portions of the Code, to make them apply
to that province. For instance, Part XVI of
the Code deals with the functions of a magistrate to summarily try an accused person
with or without his consent. One may ask
what magistrate in the Province of Newfoundland has that power. Subsections 2 and
3 of section 1 of the bill define "Court of
Appeal", so far as it may apply to Newfoundland under the Criminal Code. Section 2 specifies the court to which an appeal

These sections
define the term "magistrate", and fix the
jurisdiction of magistrates who have particular power under Part XVI of the Code to
try a variety of offences with the consent of
an accused, magistrates with additional jurisdiction to try certain classes of offences of a
general nature, and magistrates who have
absolute power to try an accused person
without his consent.
Section 7 difTers somewhat from the other
sections of the bill. Honourable senators will
recall that under the Statute Law Amendment Bill, passed at the last session of parliament, the penitentiary at St. John's is to
serve both as a penitentiary and a prison. In
order to clarify the matter under our Penitentiary Act, by section 37 of chapter 6 of
the Statutes of 1949 we provided as follows:
Notwithstanding anything in the Penitentiary Act,
19", chapter six of the statutes of 1939, every
person who is sentenced by anv court in Newfoundland to nmprisonment for life, or for a term of
years, not less than two, shai bce sentenced to
imprisonment in the penitentiary operated by
the
provice of Newfoundand at the city of St. John's
for the confinement of prisoners . . .

Hon. Mr. Leger: When a person is sentenced
to imprisonment for less than two years, is
it stated in the sentence that he is to go to a
penitentiary or to a prison?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If this amendment
should pass, it will not matter what the place
of detention is called; but if the amendment
is not passed, no matter what a judge may
say in passing sentence, a prisoner senienced
to less than two years could not, having
regard to the provisions of section 1056 of
the Code, be sent to a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Leger: It is not the same thing
to be sentenced to a prison and to a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Hayden:

Hon. Mr. Leger: Well, then, it seems to me

institution?

SEPTEMBER 22, 1949
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The provisions of the
Penitentiary Act would apply, so in that
sense it would be regarded as a federal
institution.
Hon. Mr. Leger: The difference is that a
man who is sentenced to two years or less
in Newfoundland will be committed to a peni-

tentiary, whereas in the other provinces a
man sentenced to a similar term is committed
to a prison, which is not the same thing at
all.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right. A man
sentenced to a term of less than two years,
in any province except Newfoundland, may
not be confined to a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the amendment to
section 7 becomes effective, the institution
maintained by the Newfoundland government
will continue to be used for the confinement
of prisoners whether sentenced to a term of
less or more than two years. All sentences
will be served in this one institution.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Which is a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, it is in fact a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In order to determine
who should pay the cost, it is important to
know whether it is a penitentiary or an
ordinary place of detention.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As the honourable senator from Newfoundland (Hon. Mr. Baird) has
said, and as I see in the explanatory notes,
it is sometimes referred to as a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Would these minor offenders be kept separate and apart from those
who in the strict sense of the term are
penitentiary prisoners?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not in a position
to answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Baird: The answer is no. Irrespective of whether they are serving life sentences or sentences of less than two years,
the prisoners are kept more or less together.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In Ontario if a man is
sentenced to serve six months' imprisonment,
he is sent to a provincial institution and the
province pays the per diem cost. If, on the
other hand, he is sentenced to a term of more
than two years, he is committed to Kingston
penitentiary, and the cost is borne by the
federal government. There is some confusion
here. If a man is sentenced to serve six
months at this institution in St. John's, which
in fact is a penitentiary, will the federal
government pay the cost? Or, vice versa, if
he is sentenced to a term of two or more
years, will the province of Newfoundland
pay the cost? How is it to be worked out?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: This institution is now
used by Newfoundland for the confinement of
all prisoners, no matter what the length of
their sentence may be. In order to get oui
criminal laws functioning in Newfoundland,
it is proposed to utilize this institution in
exactly the same manner as it has been used
in the past.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then the Province of
Newfoundland will continue to pay the cost',
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot answer that
question. I should think that the Newfoundland legislators will be sufficiently alert to
recognize that elsewhere in Canada a sentence of two years or more is served in a
penitentiary; and realizing that the maintenance of a penitentiary is a federal matter,
they might charge the Dominion Government
for maintenance of prisoners serving two or
more years. As I understand it, this amendment is purely a matter of convenience, to
help facilitate the commencement of our
general statute law and, particularly, the
Criminal Code, as it applies to Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can we not assume that
this matter will be taken care of in due course
by the proper authorities?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I should think so.
This machinery is for the purpose of facilitating the operation of the Criminal Code in
Newfoundland. I think we can assume that
the Governi-nent of Newfoundland will be
sufficiently interested and alert, to see to it
that in Newfoundland the same direction is
given to matters affecting the confinement of
prisoners, as is given in the other provinces
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend if the administration of this institution
will remain with the province of Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot give an
authoritative reply to that question, but for
the present I would say that it would. However, I should think that the federal government would soon have to exercise some sort
of supervision over this institution, because
the statutory authority is in the hands of
the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is under the provisions
of the Penitentiary Act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Did not the terms of agreement make some provision for that?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All the agreement provides for is the bringing into force of the
general statute law of Canada.
Section 8, which is the last section, is a
matter of general application. Honourable

SENATE
senators will recall that in 1948 a considerable
number of amendments to the Criminal Code
were passed. On October 1, 1948, all the
amendments were to go into effect, with the
exception of section 35, which introduced to
the Criminal Code a new Part XVI. The
present sections of Part XVI were not merely
revised, they were rewritten. The position
of magistrates and their jurisdiction was
completely changed. The new Part XVI will
not become law until October 1, 1949, and
this amendment is to prevent it from becoming law until a day to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council. There
have been requests from various provinces
to this effect. Under Part XVI, as passed in
1948, the jurisdiction and the functions of
magistrates were changed. The original provisions of Part XVI provided for various
kinds of magistrates with varying powers,
and set out certain offences which any
magistrate could try with the consent of the
It also set out other types of
accused.
offences which certain other magistrates, as
defined in the Code, could try with the consent of the accused. Then, too, there were
some offences which only certain magistrates
had absolute power to try without the consent
of the accused. The purpose of the amendments of 1948 was to do away with these
distinctions and different types of magistrates,
and to define the jurisdiction of a magistrate.
It was also desired to abolish the absolute
power that certain magistrates had to try
certain offences without the consent of the
accused. It was felt that this step would
help simplify the somewhat complicated
procedure.
However, a number of provinces, particularly Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario
and British Columbia, have made representations that the institution of Part XVI should
be further delayed. Having regard to the
fact that all magistrates are not equally
qualified, it is felt that the consent provision
contemplated by Part XVI-which is very
wide-should not be conferred indiscriminately upon all magistrates. Under the new
Part XVI there is no distinction or difference
of grade; it simply provides that if you are
a magistrate and have the consent of the
accused you are empowered to deal with a
wide variety of offences. Some of the
provinces felt that their magistrates are not
sufficiently qualified to try all types of offenders. Another objection is that abolition of
the absolute jurisdiction now enjoyed by
certain magistrates would have the effect of
crowding the higher courts with many cases
which should be dealt with by magistrates.
Under the new Part XVI the accused, no
matter how trivial his alleged offence, could
refuse his consent, and if he did that he

would have to go for trial before a higher
court, such as, perhaps, a County court. Were
this to happen in many cases the higher
courts might become bogged down, with the
result that serious delays would occur in the
bringing of accused persons to trial. So
the request from certain Attorneys General
is, not that Part XVI be repealed, but that
the bringing of it into force be delayed for
a further indefinite period. In conformity
with this request, section 8 of the bill provides that Part XVI of the Code shall come
into force, not on the lst of October, 1949,
but on a day to be fixed by proclamation of
the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is expected to be
gained by delay?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The provinces which
have requested the delay claim they still
have to do some tuning up-if I may put it
that way-of their magisterial system. That
is easily understood, because not all magistrates are lawyers, and not all of them are as
yet qualified by training or experience to try
persons accused of some of the charges that
could, with the consent of the accused, be
dealt with by a magistrate under the new
system. In some provinces the qualification
of magistrates is a matter that would need
careful consideration before the new system
is adopted.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, after
listening to my honourable friend's explanation, and the discussion, it occurs to me that
a little thought might be given to the principle
involved here. Under this provision a Newfoundlander convicted of a relatively trivial
offence, such as common assault or violation
of a traffic law, might find himself incarcerated with persons convicted of armed burglary and heinous crimes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Apparently that has been
happening right along.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Perhaps that is so, and it
may be that the present practice should be
continued; but I think we should have an
appreciation of what this provision means.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the
Senate went into committee on the bill.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-"magistrate":
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable members,
Newfoundland is now usually referred to as
one of the Maritime provinces. At Dorchester,

SEPTEMBER 22, 1949
New Brunswick, there is a federal penitentiary
which I understand serves the Maritime
provinces, and I should like to know whether
a Newfoundlander convicted of an offence,
for which the judge felt he should be sent to
penitentiary, could be sentenced to serve his
terrn at Dorchester.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my honourable
friend leave that question until we come to
section 7, which deals with penitentiaries?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Very well.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-surnmary trial in certain
cases:
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Am I right in understanding that once this bill is given third
reading the Criminal Code will be amended
in the nine provinces where it is now in force,
but that it will not apply to Newfoundland
until it is so proclaimed?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why should we not
make the amendment of the Code simultaneous with proclamation of the Code for Newfoundland? Al the amendments are designed
for application to Newfoundland, and it seems
to me that at least we should have some assurance as to when it is intended to proclaim
the law there.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It will be necessary to
hold certain meetings in Newfoundland for
the instruction and briefing of magistrates
and other judicial officers there upon the
Criminal Code as a whole. I am advised that
it is intended to do this early in October, and
that shortly afterwards the Code will be proclaimed in the new province, as provided for
in chapter 1 of the statutes passed last
session. My information is that the proclamation will be made before the autumn is over.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the criminal
law in Newfoundland at present? Is it the
criminal law of England, as modified by the
local legislature?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would prefer to have
that question answered by a senator from
Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Baird: The Newfoundland law is,
I think, undoubtedly based upon the English
law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there a Criminal
Code in force in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Baird: I am not sure of that. The
Newfoundland Minister of Justice is in the
gallery, and with permission of the house
I will consult him. I should be able to have
an answer to the question within a few
minutes.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not want to make
a nuisance of myself; I just asked the question for general information.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I should like to have the
privilege of answering the question.
Section 4 stands.
Sections 5 and 6 were agreed to.
On section 7-penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Now I come to the question asked a moment ago by the senator from
Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). The
best answer I can give to the question is
this: a person sentenced to a term, which in
the ordinary sense is a penitentiary term,
must go to a penitentiary in the province in
which he is sentenced, but the Penitentiary
Act provides that, for various reasons,
prisoners may be transferred from one penitentiary to another, not necessarily within
the province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think I can assist the
promoter of this bill by telling him of conditions in Manitoba. There we have a penitentiary, and of course as we are a lawabiding people there are many empty cells.
Our trouble is the frequent transfer of
prisoners from Ontario to the penitentiary in
our province.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am told that when they
get there you have trouble keeping them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, they try to get back
to Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I should like to ask the
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) a
question. Is it not the intention of this section of the bill to legalize what is now the
practice in the province of Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I understand that this
provision is necessary because what is now
being done is illegal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Mr. Chairman, we have
had a timely protest from the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I think
we should have some assurance that this
potential mixing of offenders will not be
continued. While at the present moment we
are prepared to amend the law sufficiently to
cover what has been going on, we have some
responsibility, and should be assured by the
authorities that if non-segregation of prisoners in Newfoundland, is to be permitted, it
must be only as a temporary expedient. I
think it would be well to call this to the
attention of the authorities.
Hon. Mr. Howden: I am only a medical
doctor, but like my friend from Thunder Bay

SENATE
(Hon. Mr. Paterson) I take it that the purpose of this section is to make the Canadian
law apply to the province of Newfoundland.

the end of that time there is reason for its
continuation, we at least will have control
of it. As it now stands we have no control.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, but so far as section 7 is concerned, we are making an exception. Newfoundland has at the present time
one penal institution, situated at the city of
St. John's, where prisoners, irrespective of
their term of imprisonment are confined.
The purpose of the section is to permit that
practice to continue. With that exception the
Criminal Code and other general statute law
becomes the law of Newfoundland. Without
this provision prisoners could not legally be
sent to that institution for a term of less than
two years.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If my friend will move
an amendment, I will second it.

Hon. Mr. Paierson: But is that not the law
now?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. The law of Newfoundland at the present time is that both
classes of prisoners may be sent to such an
institution; therefore, section 7 would perpetuate the present legal position with
respect to the confinement of prisoners. This
is at variance with our conception of segregation of long and short term ofTenders. It

whether this measure, which is for the purpose of getting things goiing, is acceptable in
its present form by this body, in view of
the fact that our legislators and the government have shown strong eviience of a determinei policy to segregate the two classes of
prisoners.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is this the only institution
of its kind in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Apparently it is.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Can you tel! us how
long this practice has been going on?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would think ever since
the institution has been in existence.
Hon. Mr. Farris: J should think the point
raised by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) should
be given some consideration. Our powers
here are largely negative; we can stop legislation, but when we make amendments we
have no assurance that they will get beyond
this house. I think we are obligated to continue for the present what has been the
practice in Newfoundland; but I am reluctant to accept the principle that it be continued indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would suggest that we
amend subsection (e) of section 7 by adding
to it the words "This provision shall remain
in force for a period of five years". If at

Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think five years is too
long.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why not make it three
years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think five years is
necessary if the system is to be established
and new buildings are to be erected.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Make

Hon. Mr. Farris: The suggestion has been
made that the amendment read as follows:
"After '(e)' insert the words 'until January
1, 1954' ". I would move the amendment in
that form.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: May I ask whether this
legislation will change the status of this institution, in that it will be a federal institution,
a penitentiary of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No: it is given the dual
status of a penitentiary and a prison.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: That is very important.
A prison is a provincial institution; a peniicntiary, I take it, is a federal institution.
When une applies for permrîission to enter, let
us s- y, a college, or seeks admission to the
United States, a question commonly asked is:
-1 ve

penitentiary?".

Now, if one had been sent to this prison after
conviction under, for example, the Liquor Act,
it could be said, "This fellow has been in the
penitentiary". I do not like the idea of labelling a man who weas imprisoned under those
circumstances as having been in a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That situation has existed
in Newfoundland for many years, and if by
this legislation it is continued for the present,
it is with the approval of the representatives
of that province.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, the responsibility
nov is ours: and for that reason I say that
a period of five years is too long.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is not five years,
because the date provided for is January 1,
1954.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: That is a pretty long time.
The amendment was agreed te.
Section 7, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 8-Coming into force.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think the indefinite
postponement provided for under this section

SEPTEMBER 22, 1949
is a little unsatisfactory. We studied part
XVI when it was bef ore us a year ago, and I
think all of us were in favour of it. I would
far rather have the bill before us again to
eliminate difficulties, if there are any, or have
it put into force at some specific time, than
defer it in this indefinite way,-perhaps to
bury it forever, perhaps to bring it shortly
into force.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The purpose of this is to
provide time to meet with the various provinces that have made requests for further
delays, with a view to reaching common
ground on the working out of this legislation.
There is no idea of burying it, in fact at the
present time the Criminal Code is being completely revised, and very shortly we shall
have an opportunity to review not only this
particular part, but the Code as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I recall a personal
experience? Years ago the old system of
appointing magistrates was in force in the
province of Manitoba. There was a magistrate in practically every town in the
province.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Justices of the Peace.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There was practically
unanimous agreement in the legislature that
that system was not in the interests of good
administration. Legislation was passed providing for, I believe, ten districts, and wellqualified men were appointed to act in those
districts and to travel around where they were
required, and except in a very limited class
of cases, justices of the peace ceased to function. This system, which of course had
nothing to do with the Code, took some time
to put into full operation; there were difficulties to be ironed out.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In what year was this
legislation passed?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The present Mr. Justice
Major, who was responsible for it, became
Attorney-General in 1928, and I left after
the session of 1935, so it was during that
period of time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: About twenty years ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was very fortunate that
we postponed putting the system into full
effect until al the details had been worked
out, because a lot of difficulties arose. Some
justices of the peace did not want to resign,
and in general there was a great deal of
trouble. But the system has worked out perfectly. There have been no complaints,
either from the main body of citizens or from
the practising lawyers. If we can persuade
backward provinces like Ontario, British
Columbia and Nova Scotia to introduce an
up-to-date magistracy system, it will be a
very great thing for Canada.

33

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend is in a reminiscent mood, and perhaps I shall be pardoned
for following suit. I became AttorneyGeneral of Ontario in 1934, and one of the
first acts for which my administration was
responsible was the reform of the magistracy
of our province. I found in Ontario that conditions were the same as those my honourable
friend has referred to as then existing in
Manitoba. We had a system of local magistrates; for the most part they were not lawyers. Often they had their offices in the
municipal buildings, from which they ruled
their local principalities, not infrequently in
close association with the chief of police-who
also perhaps was the only policeman-and
the municipal authorities. Al being in one
building, they formed a governing clique in
that little locality. People accused of offences
were known to go there, not for trial, but to
find out what was going to be done with
them. Accentuating the evils of the situation
was the fee system. The magistrate was paid
by fees levied against accused persons; when
he found the victim guilty he got something
out of the trial, and when he acquitted him
he worked for nothing. I would not say
anything derogatory of these magistrates;
I have no doubt that they were superior to
little monetary considerations, but they were
not given credit for their high-mindedness.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They found people guilty
quite often!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They found them guilty
fairly frequently.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: "If you are not guilty
why are you here?"
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The evil lay chiefly in
the attitude of the local people towards that
governing system, for the magistrate was not
credited with being sufficiently disinterested
to find a man guilty or to acquit him without
regard to personal considerations. In the
province of Ontario, that "backward province" to which my honourable friend has
referred, the territory was divided into
seventeen districts, usually with two or three
magistrates to a district. As in Manitoba,
they were itinerant magistrates.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Were they lawyers?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Except those who had
had experience. During my period of office
I refused to recommend for appointment to
the magistrates' bench anybody who was not
a lawyer, and I "got away with it" during
the time I was in charge. I believe that
system has been adhered to, not absolutely,
but fairly well, during the intervening years.
In making such a reform the great difficulty was to find some person to whom complaints could be made in a locality where

SENATE
there was no resident magistrate. It was
necessary, therefore, to also reform our system
of justices of the peace. In the past that
ancient and honourable title had been sought
by many people, because it gave them the
right to swear affidavits and the right to add
to their letterhead the rather high-sounding
initials "J.P.". I found records of the appointment in Ontario of no less than 10,000 justices
of the peace. It was not known whether they
were alive or dead, and there was no record
of what they had done. Therefore, by order
in council, I discharged from office some
seventy-nine magistrates and 10,000 justices
of the peace at one sitting. I was reminded
of the King of France who wished that all
his enemies had just one neck, so that he
could sever their heads with one blow. We
then proceeded to appoint itinerant magistrates from the best men available. We abolished the fee system, and put the magistrates
on a stipendiary basis. In each one of these
localities we appointed the best non-legal men
we could get. They were to act as justices
of the peace, hear complaints, issue summonses, subpoena witnesses and, if necessary,
prepare cases for trial on the approval of
the magistrate. That system has done almost
untold good in the province of Ontario.
These humble magistrates' courts are the
most important ones in our communites. They
do not deal with important matters of finance
and property, but they enter into the homes
and lives of our people as do no other courts.
In the past it was thought infra dig for a
lawyer of standing to appear in police court,
but that is not the case today. The courts
have taken on a fuller appreciation of their
own dignity, and today's system is much the
same as the one which I devised in 1934. The
Ontario magistrates of today are wellinformed men, and I think each of them is
quite capable of carrying out Part XVI of
the Code as enacted some time ago. Probably
the magistrates in such provinces as Manitoba are not so well educated as those in
OntarioHon. Mr. Haig: Ontario did not ask for any
delay.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No; but if delay is
required in other provinces, I suppose we
should pass this section. However, it should
only be accepted on the understanding given
by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), that this is not an
indefinite delay, and that the subject matter
will come before us again.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What arrangement did
you make for paying the representatives of
the Crown? I refer to those men who
prosecute cases for the Crown throughout
the districts.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In Ontario most of them
were paid on a fee basis. Had I remained
Attorney-General for a longer period, I think
we would have abolished the fee system
completely so far as they were concerned
too. I think it is high time that this reform
took place in Ontario and other provinces
as well. I do not like an official of the court
being interested in the decision as to whether
or not a man is guilty.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is not what the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) meant. He was referring to
cases in Western Canada that were tried by
the agents for the Attorney-General. They
probably attended preliminary hearings and
got paid when they took cases on. In many
instances the cases should not have been
tried at all. The representatives got paid
for each case they took to the higher court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think we have
that trouble in Ontario. We still pay CrownAttorneys by fees.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: For each case they
handle?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In some of the outlying
districts we still pay by fees, but most Ontario
Crown-Attorneys are paid stipends. We are
at least working in that direction, and I think
we have made some progress in recent years.
I hope that the time will come when the fee
system will be abolished completely as
regards
Crown-Attorneys
as well
as
magistrates.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think that in every
province they should be paid a salary. The
reason I asked my question was that I
recalled a case that completely shocked me.
A neighbour of mine was working for a
certain company in our village. Each director
of that company was accused of illegally
taking company funds. It seems that they
had not consulted the shareholders of the
company, and there was a shortage of funds.
This neighbour of mine, the father of six
little girls, was subsequently arrested.
I
went bail for him, and while awaiting trial,
which was set over for six months, he
received an opportunity to get work on Vancouver Island. He came to me and asked
me if he might take the job. I said, "Certainly, I am not watching you. If you can
get work, as far as I am concerned, you can
go to Mexico." I helped him to get away,
and then I spoke to the officials. I said,
"Now, this man is really not guilty. Why
bring him back?" As the result of my conversations I learned that if this man returned
to stand trial it would mean $50 to the representative of the Crown. And I was told
that he needed the money. I was shocked

SEPTEMBER 22, 1949

to think that this poor man would be forced
to travel all the way from Vancouver Island
so that the prosecutor could earn $50. After
paying the amount, I persuaded them to leave
him alone. I maintain that these representatives should be paid a salary.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It is not my intention to
delay the house, but in the light of the question which arose a few minutes ago regarding the criminal law of our new province,
I asked to have sent to my desk the Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland. Even
a most cursory examination would indicate
that there may be some difficulties in applying
the Canadian magisterial system to conditions
on the island. I am sure honourable senators
would be interested in a brief statement as
to the criminal law there. It is set out in
a general Act entitled "Of the Application
of the Criminal Law of England and of
Pardons", being Chapter 95 of the Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland, 1916, Vol. II.
Section 1 reads:
In all cases not provided for by local enactment
the law of England, as to crimes and offences, shall
be the law of this Colony, so far as the same can
be applied; subject to such amendments, alterations, and further enactments of the Imperial Parliament as may hereafter be made ...

That is the general application of the common law and statute law with reference to
criminal offences in Newfoundland. I find in
the index of the Consolidated Statutes that
there are a number of local Acts dealing with
special cases, such as perjury, public processions, lotteries, slander, and the protection of
animals. There is also an Act relating to the
jurisdiction, power and procedure of stipendiary magistrates and justices of the peace
in dealing with certain offences. There would
appear to be special provisions designed to
meet the circumstances in a country having
twelve or thirteen hundred small settlements
scattered over a long coastline, in which there
would not be available qualified stipendiary
magistrates in the sense that we know them.
The island's statutes provide that a justice of
the peace may try persons charged with petty
offences, which include such things as the
stealing of codfish, the causing of damage to
minor property, the injuring of animals, and
so on, where the amount involved does not
exceed $20 or some other small specified sum.
I have brought this to the attention of the
committee because I thought it might answer
a question in the minds of some senators.
Newfoundland is not to be classed as a backward province at all, and there may be good
reason for its delay in adopting the provisions
of Part XVI of the Code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
expressed the hope, though not in these words,

that the time would come when, for the prosecution of criminal cases, Crown Attorneys
would be paid salaries rather than fees based
upon the success or failure of the prosecution.
This suggests another thought to me. Our
criminal law has come down to us from very
rough times. Over the years we have now
and then endeavoured to humanize it, both
as to its penalities and its application. I hope
the day will come within the lifetime of most
of us, when the State will compensate counsel
for the defence as well as counsel for the
prosecution, particularly in major cases. As
things are now a great injustice may be done
by placing a person under the heavy financial
strain of defending himself against a charge
of which he is entirely innocent. Unless he is
a pauper, an accused person has to pay not
only his lawyer's fees, but the fees of witnesses and various other costs involved in building up a defence, including the cost of providing necessary exhibits, and not a few men
have been financially ruined in this way.
I do not know just how present conditions
in this respect should be modified. If someone asked me what I would do about it, I
could not answer off-hand, but I do say that
we should be thinking about this feature of
our criminal procedure. Whether an accused
person is innocent or guilty, the adequacy of
his defence should not be dependent upon his
financial position. Today if he has means he
can make certain that every possible defence
will be brought before the courts on his
behalf, but if he is poor he may sometimes get
short shrift, and perhaps be convicted without
having the charge against him fully investigated. As I say, I hope the time will come
when we shall pay public defenders on the
same basis as public prosecutors.
The Hon. the Chairman: Honourable members, we are considering section 8, which
refers to the date when the Act shall come
into force, but the discussion has been wide
of this. I would ask honourable members
to confine themselves to the section under
consideration.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 8 provides for
the time of application of the Act, which
deals with the very things we have been
discussing, so I would respectfully suggest
that our discussion has been entirely in order.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable members, I
would like some member of the legal fraternity to clear up for me a point in connection
with section 8. The section says that the
Act shall come into force on the ist of
November, 1948, but the explanatory note on
the opposite page states that the new part of
the Act was to come into force on the 1st
of October 1949.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Section 8 repeals section 44
of chapter 39 of the Statutes of 1947-48,
which reads as follows:
This Act shall come into force on the first day of
November, one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight, except section thirty-five thereof which shall
come into force on the first day of October, one
thousand nine hundred and forty-nine.

For this section there is substituted a new
section 44 which provides that section 35that is new Part XVI of the Code-shall come
into force on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council.
The section was agreed to.
On section 4 (reconsidered)-summary trial
in certain cases:
Hon. Mr. Baird: Honourable members, I
have a reply to the question raised by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I am informed that at
present the English criminal law applies in
Newfoundland. Any criminal statute passed
in England becomes law automatically in
Newfoundland within a year, unless the local
legislature passes some law to the contrary.
Section 4 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The bill was reported, as amended.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill, as amended.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed.
EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this bill was given second reading in this
chamber in the spring of this year, but fell
by the wayside owing to the dissolution of
parliament, which took place shortly thereafter. It again falls to my lot to explain it to
this honourable chamber. It is a departmental measure which I think is unexceptionable, and brings into effect a number of
desirable changes in the present Exchequer
Court Act.
The first proposed change affects Section 18
of the Act. The present section is rather
unusual. It reads as follows:
The

Exchequer

Court

shall

have

exclusive

original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand

is made or relief sought in respect of any matter
which might, in England, be subject of a suit or
action against the Crown, and for greater certainty,
but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or
money of the subject are in the possession of the
Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.

I direct the attention of honourable senators particularly to these words:
. . . in all cases in which demand is made or relief
sought in respect of any matter which might, in
England, be subject of a suit or action against the
Crown . . .

The effect of that is that an amendment to
the laws of England, passed by the British
parliament, enlarging or diminishing the right
of action against the Crown, might affect the
jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court without
the parliament of Canada having anything to
do with it. Obviously it is an old section,
and under present circumstances is totally
inapplicable. This bill purports to amend
section 18 by omitting the reference to the
laws of England, and providing simply that:
The Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods
or money of the subject are in the possession of the
Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.

That is the first proposed amendment.
Section 2 of the bill proposes to make three
changes in the Exchequer Court Act, all of
vhich I think will appeal to the judgment of
honourable senators. First, it allows an appeal
from an interlocutory judgment of the
Exchequer Court to the Supreme Court of
Canada in cases in which leave for such
appeal has been granted by a Judge of the
Supreme Court of Canada; second, it extends
the period for appeal from a judgment of the
Exchequer Court from thirty to sixty days,
which corresponds with the usual period for
appeal now allowed from the provincial
courts to the Supreme Court; third, it varies
and modernizes the procedure which an
appellant must follow when he launches an
appeal.
The procedure which the present Exchequer
Court Act lays down for appeal is rather
peculiar and very old-fashioned. It requires
that the appellant shall give notice to the
Registrar of the Supreme Court that he
intends to appeal, and then the Registrar shall
set the appeal down for hearing and shall
notify the other party that the appeal has
been launched. By the amendment now proposed the procedure would be modernized in
this fashion: the appellant shall give notice
of his appeal to the other parties in the
case, and lodge his appeal with the Registrar,
who then shall set the case down for hearing.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Before leaving section 4,
will my friend state why it is necessary to

SEPTEMBER 22, 1949
continue the practice of requiring a deposit of
$50 as security for costs on an appeal?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I might answer my
honourable friend by asking him "Why not?"
Hon. Mr. Leger: Well, it is not so in the
Supreme Court or in the lower courts. Why
should this practice be continued in the
Exchequer Court?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know why the
practice is continued. This bill makes no
reference to a change in that respect.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I know that it does not, but
my friend has just said that the bill proposes
to modernize the Act. I thought it might do
away with the provision requiring a deposit
of $50.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no instructions
on that point. Perhaps the honourable senator wishes to move an amendment.
Hon. Mr. Leger: T thought the government
would do it as a matter of grace.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no right to
speak for the government in that matter.
Section 4 of the bill proposes to amend the
Act, to permit the Judges of the Exchequer
Court to make rules providing for the examination for discovery of departmental officers
in cases in which the Crown is interested; it
also proposes to allow the Judges of the
Exchequer Court to make rules, as is common
in the Civil Courts in the provinces, providing
for the medical examination of parties who
claim damages by reason of personal injuries.
That, honourable senators, is as simple an
explanation as I can give of the bill.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
my friend has asked a question concerning
the deposit of $50 for security of costs. I may
be wrong, but as I understand it the costs are
the fees of the solicitors who represent the
Crown in such cases. For instance, if I sue
the Crown in the Exchequer Court, I am
required to put up $50 costs, and if I lose the
case the officials of the Department of Justice
put the $50 in their pockets. Is that not correct? That I understand is what takes place.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The solicitors?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The solicitors or counsel who appear for the Crown tax their costs
against my client, and the $50 deposit pays
their costs.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To the extent that that
is possible.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To the extent that they
are allowed costs. Usually the $50 is eaten
up, and some more besides. On the other
hand, if my client brings an action in the

37

Exchequer Court and succeeds, does he tax
costs against the Crown?
Hon. Mr. Leger: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think not. I do not
think the Crown pays costs in the Exchequer
Court.
The bill that is before us is for the modernizing of the Exchequer Court Act. My friend
is quite right in saying that some consideration should be given to the matter of the $50
deposit. The Exchequer Court should be on
the same basis and should operate in the same
way as all other courts. For instance, I can
take a case before the Supreme Court of
Ontario without making a deposit of any
amount. I merely pay $2.50 to issue a writ.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But not to appeal,
surely.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, I can go to the
Appeal Court in the province of Ontario
without posting any security for costs.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Of course an application
can be made requiring you to put up security
for costs.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Only when the defendant
is out of the jurisdiction, or there are some
special reasons.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is not so in the other
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Leger: It is so in New Brunswick.
Only where the party is out of the jurisdiction is security for costs granted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am fairly sure of my
ground in saying that security for costs is not
ordered within the province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If the person is out of the
jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, if he is out of the
jurisdiction, that is another matter. That
constitutes a special reason for giving security. Usually in an appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada application is made on
behalf of the respondent that the appellant
give security for costs, and ordinarily it is
awarded in appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada from judgments of the Supreme Court
of Ontario. But this is not a case of appeal
at all; it has to do with the original trial of
the action.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid I cannot
have explained the matter with sufficient
clearness. What I was dealing with was
appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer
Court to the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was wrong, then,
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Godbout, seconded by Hon. Mr. Petten,
that an humble Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General for the gracious Speech
which he has been pleased to deliver to both
Houses of Parliament.

Hon. Mr. Copp: Honourable senators, I
should like to make a brief explanation. It
will be noticed that when this Order was
before the house a few days ago, the adjournment of the debate was moved by the leader
of the government, (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
He is unavoidably absent this evening but
is desirous that the debate should not be
postponed on that account. I believe the
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) is prepared to go on with the
debate this evening, and that other members
also wish to participate. In the circumstances
I would ask that the leader be given an
opportunity to speak in the debate at a later
date.
The debate was resumed (from Wednesday,
September 21):

Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
in rising to take a brief part in this debate, I
wish first of all to congratulate the mover
(Hon. Mr. Godbout) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Petten) of the Address on the subject
matter of their speeches and the manner in
which they delivered them.
I should also like to pay my respects to
you, Mr. Speaker, for the splendid work that
you have done in the Senate in years gone by,
and to congratulate you upon your attainment of the high position which you now
occupy.
In a very humble way I should also like to
extend my sincere welcome to the new members of the Senate. They have taken on
important responsibilities, but they will find
here an atmosphere of good will and friendliness, and they will have the opportunity of
making a great contribution to the welfare of
Canada.
I wish to take advantage of the latitude
which the house graciously allows in this
debate to speak of local crop conditions that
I have seen this year, and have often seen in
years gone by. Southern Alberta, the district
whence I come, is in the heart of what is
called the Palliser triangle. Nearly a hundred
years ago Captain Palliser, who was employed
by the British Government to examine and
report on the whole district, outlined an area,
roughly triangular in shape, which he considered was unfit for agricutlural purposes.
Fortunately, his prediction has not proved
to be altogether accurate, for during intervening years parts of that area have produced
great wealth, though in the heart of the
district there is short-grass country in which
crop failures are a common occurrence. Back
in 1874 the Northwest Mounted Police made
their great pilgrimage through what was then
that lone land, and when travelling through
southern Alberta their livestock suffered
greatly from lack of water. Colonel Walker,
one of the originals of that great force, said
he had never seen a country where there were
so many dust storms and where pasture was
so completely non-existent.
However, there were good years, and people
flocked into that country with high hopes.
They did not reap the golden harvests they
had hoped for, because what has been called
"the withering hand of drought" brought disappointment and often despair. The federal
government has some responsibility for
drought control, because in the early days of
this century, from 1908 to 1913, the government's homestead and pre-emption policy
brought the open range days to an end and
made the land available for settlement. It
was because of that action that land hungry
people crowded into the country. I recall
seeing in those years long lines of men and

42

SENATE

some women standing ail day and ail ni ght
in front of the land titles office, waiting for
an opportunity to file on homesteads. Th ose
people made their homes in the area, but
successive crop failures caused about 60 per
cent of them to move out, and the 40 per
cent who remained have endured long peri ods
of hard times.
Conditions this year are typical. If you
drive through the country or fly over it this
year you will see large fields of grain, fi elds
of three hundred and four hundred ac res,
being plowed down because the crop is not
worth cutting. Other fields are being cut for
feed, and some of these will yield from two
to five bushels an acre. In that district 2,700
townships will be eligible for prairie fî irm
assistance payments. That means that th iere
are 2,700 townships where the yield will be
less than eight bushels per acre. It also me ans
that about 70,000 farmers will lose their crops
and will receive the "dry bonus". Mosi -of
them will need it badly, and they ail are v'ery
grateful to the Minister of Agriculture and
to the members of parliament who voted for
the bonus. According to the estimate of the
departmental superintendent, $17 million will
be paid out this year for that purpose. At out
two-thirds of that sum will come from the
ýing
dominion treasury, the remaining third bE
from the 1 per cent levy on ail grain sold by
farmers during the last few years.
Irrigation is not mentioned in the Spe ýecb
from the Throne, but I make an eari 1iest
appeal to the members of this parliamen t to
support the Minister of Agriculture in his
effort to speed up and expand the irriga tion
program. The minister has lived in that
country and has seen conditions there, but
he may have difficulty in persuading s jmre
honourable members to realize the very g reat
need for irrigation. The farmers themse lves
are certainly convinced that it is nee led.
Indeed, the dream of the farmers there for
nearly half a century has been a benefi cial
use of the waters that flow down the eas Lern
slope of the rockies, pass through the prai ries
and on to Hudson Bay.
The cities and towns out there also are
desperately in need of this development. I )uring the last few years many new houses t iave
been built, and there has been an increas e in
lovthe urban population. The Dominion C
ernment will not get back the money thait it
has advanced for wartime housing there unless the land is irrigated, because, unless this
development is procèeded with, a good ileal
of unemployment is likely. On the o ther
hand, if the land is irrigated, a numbeîr of
new industries would probably be establis hed,
such as beet sugar factories, canneries and
quick-freezing plants, ail of which would
needed to handle the crops.

About haif a million acres in soutbern
Alberta are at present irrigated by the larger
projeets, and under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act water storage facilities have
been provided in eigbt to ten thousand small
projeets, wbich serve another quarter-million
acres, so that in ail there are about tbreequarters of a million acres under irrigation.
But engineers who have studied the probiem
are convinced tbat another million acres
could be irrigated xithout exhausting the
water supply, and some projects bave been
started to accompiish this end. For instance,
there is the St. Mary-Milk River dam, xvich
was started in 1946 and the key structure,
the Great Spring Coulee dam and reservoir,
wbich wili be compieted probabiy next year.
When the whole project bas been flnished. it
xviii irrigate about 345,000 acres of the driest
iand in soutbern Alberta and wili supplement
the water supply of 120,000 acres.
There is in Aiberta another venture in
wbicb progress bas been discouragingly slow.
About 35 years ago a patriotic British investor
put $13 million into the Bow River scheme.
It was the firsl undertaking in that une, yet
it bas not been extended. For the low cost
of about $20 per acre it could be developed,
and some 192,000 acres could be irrigated for
approximately four or five million dollars.
Year after year negotiations have been carried on between the Dominion Government.
the provincial authorities and the private
land cnmpany, but to the great disappointment of tbe people concerned, no agreement
bas been reacbed. At the present time, bowever, there is before tbe Dominion Government a proposai to buy out the land company
for $2,250,000. The people in that area are
most anxious to see tbe agreement consummated, but the long and wearisome delays
bave shaken tbeir faith in the democratic
metbod of doing business.
In the neigbbouring province of Saskatchewan approximateiy a million acres could be
irrigated, and some plans bave been made
for doing this. Sucb a deveiopment woulc
cost about $31 million, and if power xvere
developed, anotber $10 million would be
expended.
The land about wbicb I speak bas an
annual rainfail of about ten inches. If it
bad as much as fifteen incbes during tbe
growing season, good crops could be produced. But tbat very seldom bappens. Only
about 1/30 of tbe dry land can be irrigated,
but tbat small portion would produce as much
as the entire area produces at the present
time.
Canada is in need of an increase in er food
production. In the first place, tbe people need
Only about 40 per cent o
itbe
more food.
Canadians get the quantity and quaity o

SEPTEMBER 27, 1949
food they require; the remaining 60 per cent
get from one-half to two-thirds of their
requirements. The food they fail to get is
of the protective kind, such as dairy and
poultry products, fruits and vegetables. These
are the products which grow best on irrigated
land. In the second place, Canada needs a
high level of production of food to exchange
with other countries for commodities which
we cannot profitably produce. Thirdly, we
must contribute to the world food pool, from
which unfortunate peoples can draw. In the
1800's the world population was one billion;
now it is two and one-third billions. That is
an increase of about one per cent per year,
which means that approximately 50,000 new
faces appear every morning for breakfast. To
meet our share of the demand we must retain
a high level of food production. There are
no new agricultural frontiers available, so
science must make greater use of the present
supply of cultivated lands.
Canada is far behind the other nations in
her irrigation program. As I have said, we
have under irrigation about three-quarters of
a million acres, compared with 1 million
acres in Australia, 28 million in the United
States, 8 million in Russia, 6 million in Egypt
and many millions of acres in India.
Where water and food are plentiful people
will go. They will move from the dry sections; returned soldiers, thrifty people, and
immigrants, who will make good Canadians
will locate in the productive areas. The
population in the dry areas is about 3 -5 people
per square mile as against 29.7 in the irrigated
districts. Think of what such an increase
means to the life of the community, to the
schools and to the churches.
These schemes for the irrigation of land
will endure, and will be a great blessing for
the people of today and of future generations.
True, irrigation projects cost money, but
during the '30s there was spent in Alberta
alone some $31 million for direct relief, $13
million for relief works, and $1 million for
administration, a total of $45 million, which
would have gone a long way towards watering
these dry lands. Aside altogether from the
material aspect, such works should be constructed for the welfare, health and happiness
of the people of Canada. During the growing
season, in the dry areas there is much uncertainty, great anxiety and fear of want.
Irrigation would do much to banish those
fears and to bring courage and a feeling of
confidence to many deserving people.
I close with an expression of hope and
expectation that this new parliament, whose
sessions are just beginning, will accomplish
much. In the final analysis, the end and
object of all legislatiox is to improve conditions in the homes of the people. This means

that we should adjust affairs within our borders so that benefits and blessings can be
evenly distributed; that we should assume
our full responsibility in external affairs, and
that at the present time we should extend
all possible help to that little island across
the north Atlantic, that Mother of Nations,
whose economy has been so shaken by the
stress and strain of the two recent world
wars.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: My first word will be
one of warm and heartfelt congratulations to
you, Mr. Speaker, on having attained the
distinguished office which you now hold.
Knowing you as I do, and having had that
privilege for several years, I am quite certain
that you will add dignity to your office. My
familiarity with your essential fair-mindedness, Mr. Speaker, prompts me to go further,
and to say that I forgive you in advance
should you at any time during this parliament
find it necessary, in the course of your duties
to call me to order or to rule against me on
a point of procedure.
Honourable senators, my next word must
be one of special appreciation to the mover
(Hon. Mr. Godbout) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Petten) of this resolution. I am sure that
all of us, and in particular those who have
served in this assembly for some years, agree
that they have fulfilled their functions
as admirably as they could have been fulfilled. With regard to the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout) well,
we know him in Quebec. He is my old
provincial leader: we have fought election
battles together. When, -a few days ago,
the honourable senator got up to open his
remarks, we from Quebec knew what to
expect; and we got what we expected-a
speech clear, persuasive, forceful, eloquent,
conveyed with that beauty of language and
that courtesy of bearing which marks the
man. I can assure the honourable senator
that he is a most welcome addition to this
chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With regard to the
honourable senator from Newfoundland (Hon.
Mr. Petten) I would add my voice to all those
other voices-and there are 13,000,000 of
them, from Halifax to Vancouver-which
welcome him and his province into our
confederation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I listened with keen
delight to his speech, both in its historical and
its descriptive parts. I was particularly
impressed by two of the statements he made.
The first, his description of the trials and
persecutions which beset Newfoundland in

SENATE
the early days, and had the result of creating
a proud race of men, as he said, almost
fanatically jealous of their independence and
suspicious of any country which might ask
them to unite their fortunes to its own. The
second, his statement-and how true it wasthat the real benefit which Canada has gained
by the union lies in the sturdy men and
women of our new province. When he said
that I was reminded of a couplet, written by
that eighteenth-century poet Oliver Goldsmith, which many of you will recall, and
which runs like this:
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.

As the poet says, and as the honourable
senator from Newfoundland so clearly perceives, the true wealth of a country lies not
so much in its material prosperity as in the
character of its people.
We are discussing at the present time the
Speech fron the Throne. That speech refers
to many matters of considerable importance
which are worthy of debate in this chamber
and which, I trust, will be debated here. I
propose to confine my remarks this evening
to one of these topics-the one, I think, which
at the present time is the most important of
all. The Speech from the Throne contains
this paragraph:
Although the nations of Western Europe have
made substantial progress towards recovery from
the ravages of war, they have not yet been able to
restore completely their economic strength. Their
shortage of dollars continues, and international
trade remains in a state of unbalance. The government is seeking by all appropriate means to cooperate in measures to restore economic equilibrium.
The achievement of a pattern of world trade in
wvhich the trading nations can operate together
within one single multilateral system continues to
be the ultimate aim of my government.

That is a reference, of course, to what in
ordinary parlance we call the dollar-sterling
crisis. As the Speech from the Throne states,
it is a crisis in international trade; and I do
not need to emphasize what has been said
many times, that Canada is one of the
countries whose prosperity most depends
upon a free flow of international trade.
The matter was discussed and brought into
focus in a rather striking way in another
place by the Prime Minister the other day
when he brought it down to figures per
family. He remarked that in order to maintain the prosperity of this country it was
necessary to export each year goods to an
amount of $1,200 for each family in the land.
That is a clear measure of the importance of
free international trade to this Canada of
ours.
Perhaps I should remind honourable senators that the present crisis is not, as some
uninformned persons seem to think, one which
affects Great Britain alone. It is a crisis
between the sterling area and the dollar area.

The dollar area comprises for all practical
purposes, as honourable members know, the
North American continent, while the sterling
area consists not only of Great Britain but
of Ireland, Egypt, India, Australia, New
Zealand, and a number of other countries of
the Middle and Far East.
What is this crisis? In a nutshell it is this.
At the present time the countries of the
sterling area are buying from the countries
of the dollar area to the extent of approximately 600 million pounds a year more than
they are selling to the dollar area. This has
created the unbalance that we hear of, the
"gap" which the newspapers talk about.
When this crisis arose, apparently somewhat
suddenly during the course of this summer,
there was a tendency, particularly I think in
the United States, to hold that Great Britain
alone was responsible for it. One can well
understand the feeling in that regard of the
people of the United States. They would
"Good
say, without much consideration,
heavens! Look at what we have done already.
During the war, by way of lend-lease, we
provided goods and services in immeasurable amounts to Great Britain, for which we
charged nothing. After the war we spent
billions of dollars through UNRRA for relief.
Afterwards we gave a credit to Great Britain
-I think it was-"of three billions of dollars
which we supposed would last ber for five
years, but which was exhausted in a little
over one year; and for the last two years,
under the Marshall plan, we have been
voting aid to Great Britain and other European countries to the tune of $1,200 million.
So what in the world are we expected to
do now?"
That was a rather natural reaction, but I
believe that the feeling it represents disappeared when the full extent and nature
of the problem was realized. After all, as
I said a moment ago, it is not a problem
relating to Great Britain alone; it is common
to the whole of the sterling area. And then,
when you corne to study the facts of the
situation, you find that since the war ended
Great Britain in most ways has done remarkably well. Her industrial production has
increased; the output per head of the population is greater than it was before the war.
Her exports today are 50 per cent greater
than they were in the year 1938, and over
one-third larger than they were in 1937,
wnich was the peak year of the 'thirties.
There were some, and I am afraid there
are still some who are inclined to blame the
crisis on the socialist policies of the present
British government. Though I am in no way
an apologist for that government, I do think
that is a complete misapprehension. Informed
opinion seems to be that, so far at any rate,

SEPTEMBER 27, 1949
the socialist policies of the British Government have had no effect on this dollarsterling crisis. It so happens that I visited
England during the last couple of months,
and while I was there a series of most interesting articles appeared in the Times newspaper on the subject of the dollar-sterling
crisis. I do not think that the Times can be
accused of undue partiality to the socialist
government, but this is what that publication had to say on this particular point. I
quote:

England last month, if I were a resident of
that country I would strongly resist a good
many of their proposals, such as, for instance,
those to nationalize the steel industry, the
packing industry and the industrial insurance
companies. Quite apart from that, however,
it is only fair to say that whatever might be
the political stripe of the government in
power in Great Britain today, that government would be faced with the problems
which confront the present government.

SENATE
As all honourable senators know, it is
sometimes difficult for the leaders of a
democracy to tell their people unpleasant
truths.
Latterly, there has been a most startling
change in the situation caused by the devaluation of the British pound, and a similar
devaluation of currencies by other countries
in the sterling area. It is too early to say
what the effect of this devaluation will be.
The hope is that it will make it easier for the
countries of the sterling area to sell more
goods to the countries of the dollar area,
and thereby earn more dollars. It is important to realize, however, that devaluation by
itself does nothing to correct an unbalance of
trade. I am quite sure no honourable
senator supposes that the situation has been
cured by this devaluation, and that all we
have to do now is sit back and watch it take
effect, and assume that the whole matter will
be rectified in due course. Nothing can be
further from the truth. Devaluation is only
the first step in a long, tedious process.
The purpose of the devaluation is to
cheapen goods produced in the sterling area
so that they will have a better chance of
being sold in the dollar area and earning
more dollars. But if devaluation is to be
successful, if it is to achieve that object,
then it logically follows that the dollar-area
countries must be willing to accept and pay
for those extra goods. There are two parties
to any transaction of sale: the vendor and the
purchaser. If there is to be a deal the purchaser must be willing to buy. What it means
in effect is this, that we of the dollar area
be more specific, we in Canada-will
-to
have to accept substantially greater imports
from Great Britain and the other countries
of the sterling area than we have in the past.
As far as Canada is concerned, I think there
is some basis for the belief that we shall be
able to increase our imports from Great
Britain to a very substantial degree. During
the first six months of this year our total
importations to this country were, in terms
of percentages: from the United States 72
per cent, from Great Britain 12 per cent,
from the rest of the world the remaining 16
per cent. That is a considerably larger
proportion in favour of the United States as
against Great Britain than existed before
the war. I think, therefore, there is a good
deal of leeway for increasing our imports
from Great Britain and decreasing imports
from the United States, thereby favourably
affecting the value of the pound in terms of
the Canadian dollar and the value of the
Canadian dollar in terms of the American
dollar.

due respect to him I must say that I have
heard and read that statement quite often.
Can he name some things that we could buy
at a reasonable price from Great Britain
which we now import from the United States?
Woollens have at times been mentioned, but
they have gone up in price. I flatter myself
that the cloth in the suit I am at present
wearing came from the Old Country, although
of course I do not know whether it did or
not. Would the honourable member suggest
how we can increase imports from Great
Britain and decrease those from the United
States?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not pretend to
be an expert on trade. What I was saying
was that before the war the proportion of our
imports from Great Britain, in relation to
our imports from the United States, was
considerably higher than it is today. Of
what that proportion was made up I am
frank to say I do not know; but it seems to
me that we could at least get back to the
position which existed only ten years ago.
But I do not think we ought to delude
ourselves that it is possible to bridge this
dollar-sterling gap without some sacrifice
on our part in this country. I foresee that
our government may be faced with difficult
problems. A great increase in imports from
countries with devalued currencies may
cause outcries from local industries faced
with this new competition; it may, indeed,
cause distress and loss of employment in
some instances. This government and this
parliament will have to weigh very carefully
the claims for protection of those particular
industries against the broad general advantage of the country as a whole, which will
undoubtedly arise from rectifying the present
unbalance between the sterling and the
dollar areas, and as well from the opportunity,
which will come when that unbalance has
been corrected, of freeing the channels of
world trade, upon which the prosperity of
Canada as a whole so largely depends. We
have already had preliminary rumblings from
the textile industry, for instance, as to the
increased competition which it is going to
face, and I hope to refer in a few moments
to another industry which will be affected in
the same way.
The first step in seeking the cure for this
problem of unbalance between the sterling
and dollar areas is, I suppose, an inquiry into
the causes which brought it about. Some of
these causes are well known and others are
not. Let me enumerate some of the wellknown ones. First of all there was the loss of
the overseas markets of Great Britain, resulting from her having turned the whole of her

SEPTEMBER 27, 1949
one thing that may be said by way of answer
to the question asked by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is that Great
Britain, when she gets back to producing the
goods that she was producing before the war,
will be able to obtain a larger share of her
former export business.
The second cause was the loss by Great
Britain of a large part of her overseas investments, which she had to realize and sell to
pay for the war. In former days, of course,
Great Britain used the income from those
investments to make up the difference
between her exports and her imports. The
loss which she has sustained as a result of
having to realize many of those investments
is, I am informed, of the order of £25 million
a year.
The third well-known cause was the loss
by Great Britain of a large portion of her
revenue from shipping-shipping that was
sunk or destroyed during the war. Before the
war Great Britain did much of the shipping
of the world, including a good deal of the
shipping of the dollar area itself, and she
used the income derived from shipping to
make up the difference between her exports
and imports.
Those causes of the unbalance are well
known; but, as I said, there are other causes
which are not quite so well known. Let me
instance two of them. Before the war India
and other countries of the Near and Far East
which are comprised in the sterling area
imported very little from this continent. In
fact they sold a great deal more to this continent than they bought from it. In other
words, as members of the sterling area they
had a large dollar balance in their favour,
and that dollar balance was in fact so large
that it is said to have made up for Great
Britain's own dollar deficit. But since the
war that condition has completely changed.
India and the other countries of the Near and
Far East now demand the goods of this continent. They import today a great deal more
from this continent than they export to it,
and instead of helping to make up Great Britain's deficit of dollars they account on their
own for an additional deficit estimated at
about £100 million a year.
The second of these causes, which is not
so well known, has relation to the rubber
industry. Before the recent war, the very
great rubber requirements of the United
States and Canada were met by the importation of natural rubber from the sterling
countries of the Far East. We all know
what happened. The war, and the cutting
off of our source of natural rubber, made it
necessary for the United States and Canada
to engage in a very large way in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. It is estimated
45785-5j

that today the United States consumes well
in excess of 400,000 tons of synthetic rubber
each year. According to the Times article to
which I referred a few minutes ago, that
results in a loss to the sterling area of
approximately £50 million a year at the
present prices.
It is therefore apparent that one of the
ways in which we in Canada can help the
sterling area would be to revert to the use
natural rubber. That of course immediately
brings up the question of the Polymer Corporation. As honourable senators know, that
is a government company formed during the
war for the purpose of manufacturing synthetic rubber to replace the natural rubber
which we could not get from the Far East.
The question is whether the operations of the
Polymer Corporation, which I understand
still makes a great deal of synthetic rubber,
should be reduced or modified.
It goes without saying that my remarks
are not to be taken in any way, or in any
form, as an attack upon the Polymer Corporation. So far as I have been able to
ascertain, it is an extremely well-managed
company and has performed great service for
the people of Canada. I am not an expert
who can tell this house whether, and to
what extent, the operations of the Polymer
Corporation could be curtailed. I think we
would all agree that it must be retained, at
least as a pilot plant, for strategic reasons, in
case of international trouble in the future
such as we had during the recent war when
our sources of natural rubber were cut off.
But I do suggest to our government that it
should make serious study of whether it is
possible to decrease the use of artificial
rubber and revert to natural rubber for most
of our requirements. Anything that we could
do in that direction would not only benefit
the sterling area by increasing its exports to
Canada, but it would benefit us. As I understand it, the raw material used by the Polymer Corporation for the manufacture of
synthetic rubber is oil, which is imported
from the United States, and for which we
have to pay United States dollars. So, to
the extent that we could dispense with the
necessity for importing that oil, we would
decrease our spending of United States
dollars.
Another feature of this most difficult
situation, to which very little attention has
been paid in Canada, is the problem of the
London sterling balances, so called. Frankly,
I know very little about the problem; I am
sure that some honourable senators know
a great deal more about it than I do. I do
think, however, it can be shown that the

than to attempt to sell the same goods in
Canada or the United States against the keen
competition of our own manufacturers.
Human nature being what it is, I think undoubtedly that many British manufacturers
have chosen the easy way out-they have
earned pounds when they might have been
earning dollars. I believe that the governments of the United States and Canada should
take a positive attitude with respect to the
question of the sterling balances.
I was glad to sec from the official report
of the discussions between the ministers of
Great Britain, the United States and Canada,
\vhich took place in Washington ten days ago,
that this was one of the matters which came
un er review. I think It is generally realized
that it is in our interest to put Great Britain
back on ber feet as a great industrial nation,
to close the gap between the dollar area and
the sterling area, and to thus ultimately
achieve freedom of trade between the nations
of the democratic world.
These sterling balances are a hindrance
to the health of the sterling area. To put it
bluntly, and perhaps a little unfairly, we in
Canada and the United States might ask
ourselves whether we are interested in helping to put Great Britain back on her industrial
feet merely to enable her to pay off war
debts to the countries of the Middle and Far
East, which ought to have been cancelled or
at least very substantially reduced a long
time ago. After all, we on this continent
have some exuerience of fantastic war debts.

What are these London sterling balances?
Well, the word "balances" is a beautiful
euphemism. For instance, if I owed $10,000
to the Bank of Montreal, it might be called
"a balance", but it is really a debt; and
these London sterling balances are debts.
They are £3,000 million of debts owed by the
Government of Great Britain to the governmenLs of the Near and Middle East for supplies and services furnished during the war.
According to the most recent figures to which
I have had access, more than half of these
£3,000 million of sterling balances are owing
to the governments of India and Egypt.
These balances are operated in this way:
they are frozen in London, but every now and
again, by agreement between the British Government and the government of the other
country concerned, a part of them is released
by the British Government and is used by
the other government to buy British goods
to the extent of the sum released. For example, I understand that in the year 1948 the
Government of India used £150 million of ber
sterling balances to buy British goods. Those
are what the experts call "unrequited exports". In return for her export of that £150
million worth of goods, Britain got nothing
except a bookkeeping entry in some London
ledger, decreasing ber debt to India by that
amount.

SEPTEMBER 27, 1949
and Japan; that but for Great Britain, as is
well known, Egypt would have been overrun
by the German armies under Rommel, and
India would have had to face invasion by the
troops of Japan. As I say, to remind India
and Egypt of these facts might be undiplomatic. But it is possible that the United
States and Canada could do something to
relieve Great Britain of the burden of the
sterling balances. India and the other
countries of the Middle and Far East, to
whom these obligations were contracted,
import from this continent a great deal more
than they export to it. They need our money,
our goods and our services for the purposes
of their development. That being so, something might be done along the lines of an
interesting suggestion which was made by
Professor W. A. Mackintosh of Queen's University in an article which appears in the
October issue of the American quarterly
journal Foreign Affairs.

His article is en-

titled "Anglo-American Solidarity", and it
contains a most interesting discussion of problems of reconstruction and readjustment, including this question of the sterling balances.
Here is Professor Mackintosh's suggestion:
In dealing with the sterling balances held by
India, Egypt and the Middle East, the United Kingdom has played a politically weak hand and the
results have been economically costly. Canada and
the United States hold trump cards-hard currency. It may be that for a grant of hard currency
to be spent on North American goods, India and
the others would write off two or three times the
equivalent in pounds from the liabilities of the
United Kingdom, and defer sterling drawings for
a period of years. In compensation, the United
States and Canada would temporarily extend their
markets for food and capital goods and strengthen
important troubled areas.

It is obvious that the major part in any
scheme of that kind would have to be undertaken by the Government of the United
States. But I do suggest to our government
that they explore with the Government of
the United States the possibility of doing
something along the lines suggested by
Professor Mackintosh, and that they express
the willingness of this country to do its share
in connection with any arrangement which
may be arrived at.
Be very sure, honourable senators, that
anything we can do to help in the solution
of this question of sterling balances will be
well worth while. Not only will it help
Great Britain, and go far to restore healthy
conditions throughout the sterling area, but
it will hasten the day when the unbalance

between the sterling and the dollar areas
can be brought under control.
There are many other aspects of this most
difficult problem which would take far too
much time for me to discuss here, even though
I had the necessary knowledge, which frankly
I have not-questions in which matters of
currency, economics and world markets are
inextricably mingled. They are apt to baffle
the ordinary man; I must confess that many
of therm baffle me. However, without going
into any great detail, I believe we can reach
some general conclusions. In the course of
my remarks I have attempted to indicate
them. Let me recapitulate:
First: The gap between the dollar area and
the sterling area will not be bridged in a
hurry. It will be a long, arduous process,
of which the recent devaluations are but the
first step.
Second: It is almost certain that Canada,
as her contribution to the solution of this
problem, will have to do some difficult things
and make some hard and even painful
decisions.
Third: No matter how difficult or painful
the process, it is essential in Canada's own
interests that this problem shall be solved.
After all, honourable senators, what is the
alternative? If the problem is not solved,
the democratic world almost inevitably will
divide into two practically water-tight compartments, with trade between them frozen
at a very low level. For us in Canada, with
our great market in England to which we
sell our goods, and the great United States
market from which we buy so largely, the
prospect would be bleak indeed. Although,
of course, our stake in the outcome is
immensely important to us, in this matter we
are not the principals. Primarily success or
failure depends upon the continuation of
co-operation and good understanding between
the governments and the peoples of the
But
United States and Great Britain.
Canada will have her part to play, and it
will be no unimportant part. I am convinced that when our people understand the
problem in a broad general way, and when
they appreciate the vital issues involved,
they will support our government in any
step which it deems it necessary for the
country to take.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Godbout for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I first joie in the felicitations already
offered by others to the new Speaker of this
house. I should like to congratulate hin upon
attaining his present high office, which
already he has demonstrated he can grace.
I also wish to congratulate the two eminent
senators who moved and seconded the motion
for the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, and I should like to extend my
warmest welcome to the new members who
recently joined us in this chamber, particularly the honourable senator from Trenton
(Hon. Mr. Fraser), who has just taken his seat.
Ie is an old friend, having been the member
for Northumberland in another place. I hope
that he and his fellow-freshmen, those who
have come to us since the opening of this
session. may enjoy their stay with us and find
many opportunities for public service. f am
sure the new member from Trenton, by his
work and contribution in this house, will
enhance the already high reputation which he
brings with him.
I remember most keenly the great kindness
with which I was received when I, together
with other new members of that day, took
my place in this chamber in 1945. The courtesy and good will with which my fellowmenbers accepted my opening statements,
aind the toler:nce which they exhibited at

that time-and which I hope they will continue Lo exhibit-were of the utmost assistance in setting me at ease and making me
happy in the atmosphere of the Senate. I
only hope that we senators who are now
sophomores, may not fail in our welcome and
kindness to the newcomers who have just
arrived as freshmen. I am sure these honourable gentlemen will enjoy the public service which this house makes it possible for
them to render, and I am equally sure that
the Senate of Canada will benefit by their
presence here. I hope they will join in our
debates and add their opinions and views to
those of the oider members.
Honourable senators, my task at the
moment is to address you on the Speech from
the Throne. I notice that the Speech forecasts a considerable amount of important
Outstanding among the items
legisiation.
mentioned is, first, the abolition of appeals
to the Privy Council and, in consequence, the
making of our own Supreme Court of Canada
the court of final appeal for Canadian cases.
The second measure is the alteration of the
British North America Act to permit of
amendments by direct action of the Canadian
parliament, rather than indirectly, as in the
past, by resolution adopted by our parliament
and acted upon by the parliament at Westminster. With the general purposes of both
these proposals I for one am entirely in
accord; but it seems to me that in the present
speech I can perhaps make the greatest contribution by confining my discussion to the
current problems of trade and finance, which
were discussed with such clarity, force and
excellence by the senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) last night. He read, and
with some diffidence in following so notable
a lead I propose to repeat, this paragraph
frorn the Speech from the Throne:
Although the nations of Western Europe have
made substantial progress towards recovery from
the ravages of war, they have not yet been able to
restore completely their economic strength. Their
shortage of dollars continues, and international
trade remains in a state of unbalance. The government is seeking by all appropriate means to cooperate in measures to restore economic equilibrium.
The achievement of a pattern of world trade in
which the trading nations can operate together
within one single multilateral system continues to
be the ultimate aim of my government.

The fact that the senator from Inkerman and
I are both addressing ourselves to the same
topic is, I can assure the house, a matter of
chance and not of conspiracy.
In that paragraph Great Britain's shortage
of Canadian dollars with which to purchase
commodities in Canada seems to be attributed to the ravages of war. Of course honourable senators, the past is always a factor in
the present, and in this as in many other
matters the war is always a convenient excuse

SEPTEMBER 28, 1949
for unsatisfactory conditions when a more
exhaustive analysis would be either difficult
or distasteful. True, the war is a factor in
the present unbalance of international trade,
but I wish to submit that it is by no means
the only factor, and that there are causes
which lie much closer to home and for which
we are more responsible than we are for the
ravages of war.
Britain's stagnation of trade and our own
associated stagnation is a world disaster. It
is not local. Although it may have been
accentuated by local causes, the disaster itself
is world-wide. It is peculiarly a disaster
to Canada because, in the three-cornered
trading system of the past, Canadians have
paid the net debit for the many commodities
purchased by us in the United States by our
sales in the British market, and the United
Kingdom squared her account with us-and
incidentally ours with the United States-by
the excess of her exports over imports in her
dealings with the United States. If, therefore,
because of some cock-eyed policies in the
United Kingdom, in the United States or in
Canada, the United Kingdom must reduce her
purchases of Canadian goods, and in consequence we must reduce our purchases of
American goods, our standard of living will
be adversely affected.
The prospect is not pleasant, for if the
present business log-jam is not broken we in
Canada may find ourselves in the position
of reducing rents because of the tenants'
inability to pay; we may be squeezing the
water out of business by bankruptcy or otherwise. In other words, we may not be able to
carry the overhead brought about by the
boom of recent years, and we may find ourselves in the throes of a depression. We in
this chamber and Canadians generally have
a real interest in the welfare of the British
people. We observe with regret the great
danger which now faces them, forcing reductions in their supplies of food and of raw
materials for the carrying on of their business
and industrial life. Thus Britain's problem
is our problem, and the causes should be discussed without inhibition by Canadian parliamentarians-as it was last evening by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen-with
complete frankness
and without fear of treading on other people's
toes.
At the risk of over-simplification, the problem may be stated in a single sentence:
Because of the unbalance, which was referred
to in the Speech from the Throne, Britain's
gold and- dollar reserves have been running
out in recent months at the rate of $400
million quarterly. Bearing that in mind, are
not we in this chamber justified in making
man-y speeches on this subject? I hope that

others will follow me-as I am following the
member from Inkerman-in an inquiry as
to what is the trouble, how it has been
brought about, and what is the remedy. It
is to that problem that I am now addressing
myself.
Some newspapers would like to blame
the trouble on the labour unions, and they
report the efforts of labour to maintain the
living standards of its members with an air
of grave disapproval. We are left to infer
that the British workman is at fault, though
he is partially excused, in a patronizing way,
on the ground that he is tired. Only this
morning I read a newspaper statement to
effect that labour is at fault. Well, a year ago
when I toured Scotland, Ireland and England
with the Commonwealth Parliamentary party,
and visited the factories en route, I saw no
evidences of sloth on the part of the United
Kingdom worker. The fact is that men in
industry over there are working an average
of 46 hours a week, exclusive of meal and
rest periods, and they are practically all
working; there is very little unemployment.
To blame the present troubles on the working
people of the nation is both unkind and
untrue.
Anoher mistake which is made is to attribuLe the trade difficulties to a supposed slowdown in Britain's production system caused
by obsolete plant facilities and inefficient
management. There is, of course, some obsolescence; no one could go through those plants
without seeing some evidence of it; but if
some informed and observant English visitors
were to go through some of our Canadian
plants, or those of our great neighbour to
the south, I venture to say that they too
might find evidence of obsolescence. Of
course, management is human; but efficiency
is largely a matter of degree, and the proof
of it is always a matter of opinion.
The fact is however-and of this there
cannot be any dispute; it is so thoroughly
established-that the output of British industry and agriculture is from 20 to 30 per
cent above pre-war level.
I suppose that if workmen could toil longer
and harder on lower wages, and stop eating,
and if plants could multiply their output
without increasing expenses, Great Britain
could carry her present burdens and the
adverse balance besides. But, honourable
senators, this is absurd; and to attribute
Britain's position since the war to lazy men,
or to inefficient stupid management, is slanderous and very unkind.
The United Kingdom Information Office at
Ottawa, which is here for the purpose of
supplying us with authentic knowledge from

here. I submit that Canada and the United

SEPTEMBER 28, 1949
States can greatly assist in the promotion of
United Kingdom exports by simply getting
out of their way, by removing or substantially lessening the obstructions which we
and our neighbours have deliberately placed
in the channels of British trade. I refer of
course, as you must know, to our sky-high
tariffs, to our quotas and prohibitions, and to
the administrative bog holes which we maintain against imports from Britain at the
instance of pressure groups within our own
countries who quite naturally would avoid
the effort necessary to meet British competition.
In the wordy joint communique of the
Anglo-American-Canadian conference, issued
in Washington on the 12th instant, there
appears this paragraph:
Canadian representatives stated that the Canadian
government would undertake a further review of
the administrative operation of its Customs Act in
the light of these discussions. As to tariff rates, it
was noted that high tariffs were clearly inconsistent with the position of credit countries.

"The administrative operation" of the Customs Act is the tangle-foot with which
officialdom is able to bedevil foreign trade
enterprise at the instance of pressure groups
within our own borders, and I am glad to
see that its existence is admitted and that
there is some suggestion of amelioration. But
I note with regret that there is not even
a suggestion of trade or tariff concessions
for the purpose of keeping alive a British
trade which is vital to our own economy and
to our progress as a nation-almost as vital
to us as it is to Britain-although the communique does acknowledge, as I have already
observed, that high tariffs are inconsistent
with the position of credit countries.
Well, honourable senators, both houses of
parliament are now in session, and the budget, I presume, is being prepared. The
sincerity of Canada's desire for the solution
of Britain's trade difficulties may, I submit,
be judged by how substantially we ease our
tariff barriers against British imports. That
is all I will say about our own ability to
increase the trade by taking barriers out of
its way. The other solution, which I said
lay in the hands of Britain rather than of
Canada, is in the matter of competitive price.
Hon. Mr. Lesage: Before my honourable
friend goes on to that second point, may I
ask a question? My impression is that we
could increase importations from Britain if
we bought British coal. About twenty-five
or thirty years ago we used to purchase large
quantities of British coal in this country, but
now we do not get any. I remember reading
in the papers last winter that even the
English people themselves were running short
of coal, because the miners did not want to

work. I do not know whether that statement about the miners is true, and in any
event I am not blaming them, but am simply
referring to a statement that I read.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I thank the honourable
gentleman for bringing up that point. It is
very true that our importations of British
coal have greatly declined. I do not wish
to detain the house too long in a discussion
which, of course, could go on for hours, and
I will answer the question as the senator
from Inkerman replied to a somewhat similar point last night: I am not an expert in
picayune points of trade-and by "picayune"
I do not mean unimportant. No member or
this chamber attempts to bring here a
memorized list of the prohibitions to be
found in the tariff schedules, but that does
not prevent us from dealing in general terms
with the principles involved. It may be that,
when the schedules are under review, a percentage of decrease in tariffs would be the
wiser method of dealing with the problem.
Perhaps there should be a percentage of
decrease all across the board with respect
to imports from Britain, or it may be that
the decrease in rates should be greater on
some items than on others. Personally, I
am in philosophy a free trader. The senator
from Inkerman said last night that something must be done, even if somebody gets
hurt. I would say that something must be
done even though those special privileges
and advantages which we have extended-to
certain individuals in the past have to be
decreased.
I was leaving that wing of my subject and
about to switch my thought to the control
which exists in Britain rather than here. By
way of preliminary observation I may say
that one hears continually of the expenses
of social services maintained by the present
government in Britain, where one can receive
spectacles free, if he needs them, and where
a doctor will look at your tongue without
charging you for it.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: If you wait long enough.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If you wait long enough,
yes. Well, the net cost of those services does
not appear to me to be very important.
Although I am not socialistically inclined, as
honourable senators know, I am in favour
of many social services which are maintained
in this country, as well as in Britain, and
which are necessary to the well-being of
individual citizens.
However that may be, I want to call the
attention of my fellow members to the fact
that in our papers and discussions we never
find a single reference to the atrociously high
rents that prevail in the United Kingdom,
or to the curse of land monoply which blights

SENATE

industry in that tight little island. I am
speaking from knowledge of these things.
Nor do I ever see any reference to their outmoded system of taxation, which fosters the
misuse of land while it increases the cost of
living and production.
I am told that land values in Britain have
doubled since 1938. Sir Stafford Cripps talks
smoothly, and no doubt very well, of austerity
for the masses of the people, while he permits privilege to double its toll upon industry
and enterprise. I submit that the British
authorities should show good faith by adjusting their own internal conditions to assist
in the solution of their international problems
before asking us to go too far. Great Britain
should reduce her taxes which, as they
increase the cost of production, fall upon
commodities and consumption and upon
industry and enterprise.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
How can we expect England to encourage
enterprise when she has proceeded to nationalize every industry in the country?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The British people are
not proceeding to nationalize every industry.
They picked only certain big ones which
had no friends. True, they have nationalized
the railways; and in my judgment they paid
the owners more than they were worth. The
coal mines also have been nationalized, now
that their productiveness is running out, and
the owners probably were paid more than
the mines were worth. They nationalized the
Bank of England, which was already nationalized, in effect, before the present government came into power. Now they are embarking on what may be a very disastrous
course, that of nationalizing the steel industry.
Other than that, the present government of
Great Britain has been most careful not to
tread upon the corns of the real owners in
that country-the landed gentry.
I do not wish to pursue that topic further,
though I could do so. My strongest criticism
of the labour government is that, while they
have nationalized certain industries, and
now propose to take over steel, they have
appeased in every possible way the landowners of that country, and have not amended
the obsolete taxation system to which I
have referred, which makes possible the
excessively high rents which are being
charged.
I return to my line of thought when the
question was asked. I was about to say that
Great Britain should make a levy upon land
values, as was proposed in the famous Lloyd
George budget, and later by Philip Snowden,
thus easing her land monopoly and forcing
her natural resources of town and country
into use, thereby lowering rents. I submit
that it is within the power of the British

Government to reduce the cost of production
without further degrading the standard of
living of the masses, and without basing its
commercial system on the starvation of
working people.
There is still another horn of this dilemma.
I refer to the inanacles of finance which we
and other nations have forged upon the anvil
of Karl Marx. Until quite recently international trade balanced itself automatically.
In the multilateral trade of former times,
when a nation bought of its neighbours more
than it could pay for by return shipment, or
invisible credits-as Great Britain has
recently been doing-its money fell in value
in the foreign markets. Great Britain recently
has been buying in the markets of her neighbours more than she has been able to pay
for by return shipments and invisible credits;
as a consequence, irrespective of what ber
government may have said with regard to it,
ber money fell on the markets of the world.
There have been times within the memory
of every honourable senator when the Canadian dollar was lower in value in the United
States than it was at home; and when, if we
traded Canadian dollars for American dollars
we were charged a rate of exchange, and,
conversely, were credited with the exchange
when we traded the other way. The rate of
exchange varied from day to day, following
very closely the fluctuations of the financial
balance. During those periods when the
exchange rate was adverse, Canadian money
had a greater purchasing power in Canada
than it had in the United States; therefore, a
powerful incentive existed for Canadians to
buy at home rather than south of the border.
May I give a humble illustration? When for
one Canadian dollar we could buy twelve
eggs in Canada, and with the same dollar
could get only eleven eggs across the border,
we ate Canadian eggs-if we could get them.
In our factories, whenever possible, we used
Canadian parts and materials to make our
finished products. In the United States the
tendency was reversed, but equally powerful.
When an American citizen could buy twelve
eggs in the United States for one American
dollar, and for the same dollar could get
thirteen eggs in the Canadian market, he
bought Canadian eggs whenever it was convenient to do so. The same tendency which
I have described was operative in factories.
The American manufacturer bought Canadian
parts and materials for the production of his
finished article, whenever it was convenient
or possible for him to do so. In other words,
when the rate of exchange was unfavourable,
it strongly discouraged importing and encouraged exporting, and the free market soon
corrected the disequilibrium in our international financial balances. It just naturally
happened.

SEPTEMBER 28, 1949
In the years preceding the hast Great War,
in line with the Fascist and Nazi phihosophy
which gripped the world at that time-and
still does-and in conformity with economnic
nationalism, the nations of the world joined
in a movement to kihi alh international trade
by tariffs, quotas and prohibitions. When
the war broke out, most nations, including
our own, estabhished a control over currency
as well as over commodities-as a war
measure of course. In accord with world
policy, Canada erected a Foreign Exchange
Control Board to which it gave a government
monopoly of foreign exchange in our country.
We arbitrarily flxed the rate of exchange,
or declared parity, which is the sarne thing,
irrespective of financial balances and in
defiance of the true or market value of our
money. The automatic corrections of a free
market were, in consequence, lost to us.
When the war

ended Canada had in the hands of her Foreign
Exchange Control Board $1J billion in
American currency and credits which she
had taken from our citizens in exchange for
our own money and the government had
determined and was maintaining a flxed rate
of exchange.
Honourable senators who were in this
chamber in 1946 wihh remnember the vigorous
resistance which some of us presented to
those controls. 1 refer particularly, and with
my hat off, to the honourable member from,
Vancouver-Burrard, the hate lamented and
much-missed "Gerry" McGeer. I refer also
to the honourable member from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar); and there were others.
And I recollect mysehf expressing "my whohesouled, deep-rooted opposition to the principle of the bill." The bilh was carried on
division, and the Foreign Exchange Control
Board continued to maintain an artificial rate

reserves the hosses on each individual transThis foolish procedure continued

until $1 billion had gone down the sink-$l
billion of Canada's resources. Then of course
there was a crisis. Sorne people in the
Department of Finance got up early in the
morningHon. Mr. Haig: Or stayed up late at night.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, I think they got up
before their eyes were open; and overnight
we had a long hist of prohibitions against
purchases in the United States, designed to
kill trade in order to save the remaining
haîf billion dollars of our reserves.
The matter came before this house again
in 1947, and I then declared that I would
abolish the Foreign Exchange Control Board,

root and branch, and leave our f oreign exchange, both United States and sterling, to
react to its natural normal equilibrium. I
closed. at that time with this observation:
The Liberal poiicy should be the deveiopmeflt of
a truly and genuinely free economny, in whlch we
may depend upon the genius of our people to
restore and maintain the well-being 0f the nation.

But a free economny is the last thing desired
by the bureaucrats of this or any other
country. The Marxian philosophy of a conCanada,
trolled economy has prevailed.
Great Britain and all the rest have maintained flxed rates of exchange and have
endeavoured to beat the market by all sorts
of compulsions and restrictions, quotas,
tariffs and so on, which have harassed the
business world. For months we in Canada,
and the Crippses in England and elsewhere,
have been endeavouring, like old King
Canute, to sweep back the sea, until all of
us have got our feet wet, and some people
have been nearly drowned. The trade upon
which Great Britain depends for its existence,
instead of responding, as it always did in the
free markets of the past, has been nearly
ruined.
The market, gentlemen, has won in this
contest, as it always will win, irrespective of
the powers and the egotisms of governments
which propose to coerce it. Canada and the
United Kingdom have been forced to,
acknowledge the real facts and to devaluate
their money. They have done s0 in the hope
that a nearer approach to the true situation
and the actual facts will revive a trade which
they themselves have nearly murdered. The
arbitrary rate of exchange which has now
been announced is nearer than was the past
rate to the true worth of the currencies, and
I hope it will have the effect that is anticipated; I expect that it will have, in some
degree. But I would point out to you, my
fellow members, that it is stili an arbitrary,
inflexible rate of exchange, and that, like
the law of the Medes and the Persians, it
altereth not-at least until the Crippses say
it may. As a consequence you have lost once
again that correction which cornes from an
unrigged market and those natural equilibriums which are so valuable in the carrying
on of any business. The world seems to have
learned littie by its experiences and, instead
of returning to the rule of natural law and
the impartial adjustments of an unrigged
market, it still tolerates its uncrowned
Caesars with their monkey-wrench on the
balance wheel, with a consequent permanent
state of disequilibrium.
Honourable senators, 1 have spoken a long
time, and you have been most patient in
hearing me, 50 in conclusion may 1 just summarize as follows: I submit, first, that Canada
the United States and Great Britain should

SENATE
reduce their tariffs immediately and substantially; second, that Great Britain should
reduce her cost of production by shifting
some portion of her internal taxation to fall
upon land values, and third, Canada-and
her two great associates as well-should
abolish foreign currency controls and allow
a free market to determine from time to time
the rate of exchange. Thus, by liberal policies, may Canada's economy be saved from
disaster and Britain may recover the position
of leadership in the world of trade and
finance, which she occupied so honourably
in former years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, my
first duty today probably gives me the greatest pleasure-that
of joining with past
speakers in extending my heartiest congratulations to the Speaker of this august body.
Some of us younger members have not had
the privilege of being associated with you
before. sir, but we have already been so
impressed by your dignity and tolerance that
we have certainly learned to respect you.
To previous speakers, for their many kind
references to us, who are junior members, I
should like to extend my profound gratitude,
and to one very far western member especially, who has been a "tower of strength"
in my hours of loneliness, I tender my most
sincere thanks. While he did bring me down
and show me the train of tomorrow, he also
kept me from taking it today. May I also
congratulate the mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. While I regret that I vas unable
to follow the speech of the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout),
owing to my limited knowledge of the French
language, still what I could follow was most
inspiring.
Honourable senators, as you know, I am a
newcomer to this Senate of Canada.
That
being so, I feel that it is in order for me to
make a few brief remarks by way of introducing myself and the new province that I
have the honour to represent. As overyone
knows, it has taken Newfoundland's representatives a long time to get here; as a matter
of fact, we are some eighty years late. As to
their contribution to the future of this nation,
I can only tell you that in the past they met
the problems of existence with courage and
perseverance, and that now, being in the
wrider field of opportunity that union affords,
they are looking to the future with new hope,
and a firm desire to pull their weight in this
federation of British communities.
In 1869, when the issue of Confederation
was first put before the Newfoundland people,

they decided to continue seeking their fortune alone rather than in partnership with
the rest of British North America.
That
their decision was wise or otherwise is not
for me to say. I do not propose to pass
judgment upon them. I do suggest, however, that having chosen to go their way
alone, the record of their achievement in the
face of bitter odds is not one to be ashamed.
Although we may have lagged behind the
rest of North America, we have, when all
things are taken into account, made substantial progress during the past eighty years. We
do feel proud that when we finally came into
the Canadian federation, we came as a
solvent community with worth-while things
to share. I refer to our fisheries, our forests,
and our developed and proven mineral
wealth. These and other resources of lesser
value make up our material contribution to
this partnership.
But there is yet another
contribution-one which is no less important
for being abstract or spiritual; we bring to
this nation of Canada three hundred and
thirty thousand new citizens with a Newfoundland background of honesty and human
worth.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Baird: When I refer to the gains
that Canada has made by union with Newfoundland, I by no means lose sight of the
great social and economic benefits that have
corne to the Newfoundland people through
union with Canada. For them the clock of
social progress has gained perhaps fifty years
in one. Today the children of Newfoundland
have a better chance of (eveloping into
healthy anc useful citizens than they ever
had
tefore; today old age is secure in Newfoundland rather
than a nightmare
of
poverty, as it se often was for many of our
people; today we have a more equitable system of taxation, and above all, we have a
justified confidence in our future progress
and development.
As I have said, it has taken Newfoundland's representatives a long time to get here,
and the argument over their coming bas been
long-drawn out and bitter. The most potent
argument used against cofederation was that
by uniting with a larger country we would
lose our national identity, and it has long
been said in Newfoundland that if a man is
not national he is not anything. This feeling
of independence and national pride is understandable in a people who were masters of
their own destiny for almost a century.
Besides, in our case our very way of life
tended to develop a spirit of independence,
for no man is more the master of his own
destiny than the hand trawler on the Grand
Banks or the hook and line man on the coast

SEPTEMBER 28, 1949
of Labrador. However, in spite of all this
we decided by the democratie process to join
the Canadian confederation and now that we
have joined we want to be good Canadiansand we do appreciate the ready way you
opened your door to us, the stray sheep of the
British North American flock.
For myself, I have always realized the
futility of standing alone and trying to compete with the other British communities that
had pooled their resources for the common
good. But my interest in the confederate
idea goes much deeper than that, because I
happen to be married to the granddaughter
of one of the Fathers of Confederation, the
late Sir Frederick Carter, who with the late
Sir Ambrose Shea represented Newfoundland
at that historic meeting of provincial leaders
out of which confederation was born. You
can see thern in the background of that
famous painting of the Fathers of Confederation that hangs in this building. My family
is proud of its association with the birth of
this nation. It is true that when Sir Frederick
put the idea of Confederation before the Newfoundland people in the election of 1869, they
saw fit to reject it. His failure in that respect,
though, was in no way due to lack of political
skill in the presentation of his case, but
rather to the fact that as a statesman he was
about eighty years ahead of his time. I might
add that his failure to bring Newfoundland
into confederation perceptibly shortened his
days. He died a bitterly disappointed man.
Although I am a newcomer to this Senate,
I am by no means a newcomer to Canada. In
my day I have visited nearly every province
in the dominion, and I have thus had the
advantage of seeing this country and its
people through the unbiased eyes of a
stranger. What I have seen has convinced
me that here in this vast and bountiful land
lies the future of our British kind. I realize
that in a world torn apart by strange isms
Canada needs men of tolerance and social
vision to guide ber through the period of
upheaval. I am convinced that today Canada

has men of such calibre at the head of the
state; and I might say, if you will allow me,
that the Right Honourable the Prime Minister
has gained the respect and confidence of free
men everywhere.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I have heard that here in
Canada, as in most countries, there are groups
of persons who have fallen so low as to obey
the orders of the head of a foreign state, who
would tear apart the very foundation of our
western civilization and supplant it with
paganism and a new form of human slavery
whereby the individual must surrender to the
state all the personal rights and liberties that
have accrued to him through a thousand years
of social evolution. I have every confidence
that the good sense of the Canadian people
will enable them to hold fast to the sheet
anchor of their Christianity, and maintain
their confidence in an economic system that
returns to each a fair share of the wealth
produced and allows all men to be free
within the limits of civilized conduct.
I assure you that there are no communists
in Newfoundland. At least, I have never met
any. Furthermore, I do not believe that there
ever will be one. When our forefathers came
to our island and built a nest in the rock,
they were rich in their belief in Divine Providence. They had very little else to sustain
them in their battle for survival. But they
did survive, and we who have inherited their
stony acres have also fallen heir to their
simple faith in God and their desire to be
free men in a free land.
These, honourable senators, are the qualities of mind which our forefathers brought
with them across the sea, and which make up
our spiritual contribution to the life of this
nation of Canada.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Burchill the debate
was adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Godbout for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain the house at any great
length, but in view of the impact of recent
events in trade and currency on that section
of the country which I represent, I should
just like to make a few observations.
First of all, I wish to convey to you, Mr.
Speaker, my very cordial congratulations on
your selection as presiding officer of this
chamber. Your selection as Speaker shows
that your abilities have been recognized, and
I can assure you, sir, that the respect in
which we all hold you, and the contribution
which you have made since first entering this
bouse, make us all feel happy about your
appointment. I wish you a most pleasant
and interesting term of office.
I should also like to say how much honourable senators were delighted with the
speeches of the mover (Hon. Mr. Godbout)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Petten) of the
Address. The mover, by his eloquent speech,
made it quite plain that he will be a distinct
addition to the debating talent of this house.
The seconder, by his most interesting and
informative speech on Newfoundland and its
people, made an excellent impression in his
maiden effort.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I should also like to join
with previous speakers in welcoming to the
Senate the newly-appointed members. As
one who comes from the Maritime Provinces,
I particularly welcome the honourable senators from our new province of Newfoundland.
This session of parliament is an historic one,
inasmuch as it is the first to be held since
Newfoundliad has become part of Canada
and representatives from that province have
taken their places in both houses of parliament. I can assure the honourable senators
from Newfoundland that among their colleagues in this chamber they will find, as I
found when I entered as a new senator, a
friendly consideration and courtesy on the

part of all. I know that, as they become
more familiar with their surroundings, they
will enjoy the associations that this chamber
will bring to them, and will appreciate its
work and functions.
As a representative of New Brunswick, let
me say that the three Maritime Provinces
were delighted to know that Newfoundland,

after more than eighty years, had decided to
become one of them-a fourth partner. A
friend of mine from Saint John, just after
the union had taken place, was asked at a
meeting in Montreal by a very prominent
citizen of that city why there was so much
rejoicing in the Maritime Provinces over the

union with Newfoundland.

It was pointed

out to him that union, at the outset at least,
was going to cost Canada a heap of money.
My friend replied that the only answer he
could give was that misery likes company.
I can say to my colleagues from Newfoundland that the traditions, culture and

outlook of the people of their sister provinces
by the sea are not unlike those of the people
of Newfoundland; nor do their political philHonourable senators will
osophies differ.
find in the Maritime Provinces and in the
other provinces, a community of interest
which will ensure close co-operation in support of legislation which will build a Canadian nation worthy of the pioneers who laid
the foundation, the statesmen who planned
it, and the warriors who fought and died for
it, and at the same time will safeguard the
interests and the aspirations of the people
who live in the provinces by the sea.

Of course, in a country with such diversi-

fied interests as we have in Canada, every
Our new
section has its own problems.
senators will discover, as I discovered when
I came here, that wheat is grown in some
of the western provincesHon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: -and that in late years,
especially, there have been some differences
of opinion as to the best marketing possibilities for that wheat.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Where does margarine
grow?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Those of us who come
fron the East have, of course, to be guided
as to western opinion by senators from the
West, and during the last few years I have
by
been
almost persuaded, particularly
utterances of the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), that the farmers of Western Canada
thought the government's policy with respect
to wheat marketing was very unfair to the
farmers and unpopular. But in view of the
turn political events in this country since we

SEPTEMBER 29. 1949
last met, I feel that our honourable friends
from the West will have to allow us Easterners to infer at least that the majority of
western farmers are satisfied with government marketing of wheat and other farm
products.
Hon. Mr. Howard: No doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I mention this because,
at this moment, as a result of the lack of
United Kingdom markets-a matter very
admirably dealt with a couple of days ago
by the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen)-we in the Maritimes
have a reai marketing problem on our hands.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: We are a practical
example of what the lack of United Kingdom
markets can do to Canada. In our section
of the country it can affect the standard of
living of virtually every citizen in the conmunity, and therefore I can endorse in a
very real sense everything said by the
honourable senator from Inkerman about the
importance of United Kingdom trade te
Canada. In my province of New Brunswick,
and in Nova Scotia, the business of shipping
spruce lumber to the United Kingdom is
older than the Dominion itself. Unbroken
business connections with British importers
-in many cases with the same firm-have
been maintained for generations. In short,
honourable senators, the business is an integrai part of the whole economy of the
provinces.
During the war years the industry responded in splendid fashion to the demand
for wood and more wood, and exported te
Britain every foot of timber that vessels
could be found to lift. In the year 1940
exports to Britain reached 400 million superficial feet, and last year nearly 130 million
superficial feet were shipped. The industry
is geared to supply the sizes and specifications
required over there.
Nor is that the whole story. When war
broke out our people were asked to supply
pit-props, so vital to the British coal industry,
as these were no longer available from
Scandinavian sources. A purchasing commission was set up by the United Kingdom
government at Moncton, and our woodsmen
were taught the technique of producing and
preparing these props. Since 1940 this business has been most active, and in its various
branches in certain sections of the province
has employed many hundreds of men and
trucks. The work of loading and shipping in
itself provides and circulates a great deal
of money. Last season about 300,000 cords
were shipped from Maritime ports on about
150 ocean tramp steamers.

Now we are advised that, because of the
dollar shortage and the drop in prices of
pulpwood on the continent, Great Britain's
pit-prop requirements will be obtained from
Finland and other Scandinavian countriesHon. Mr. Horner: And Russia.
that Canadian
Hon. Mr. Burchill: -and
dollars will be conserved for other commodities not obtained in the dollar areas. Honourable senators will readily see what this will
mean to the people of my province, when
the means of livelihood of a great many
workers disappear overnight.
I would be the last person to criticize the
British people or their government, who
through the years have endured and spent
their accumulations on a war in which everything was at stake for ail of us. With ail
respect for what my friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said yesterday,
I may say that I heard the Archbishop of
York, who spoke in Halifax the other day,
describe the Britishers as a tired peopletired of bombs and rockets-who, while
getting enough to eat, are certainly not
enjoying the nourishing food that is served
on the tables of our Canadian homes.
Honourable senators, international trade
is a two-way street, and it is clear that if
we want to sell we must find a way to buy.
How badly trade is out of balance was indicated by the figures of 1948, which showed
that Great Britain bought $1,600 million
worth of goods and sold only $600 million
worth to the dollar areas.
In the Maritimes section of this country,
where United Kingdom sales mean so much,
we would be glad to use more British-made
goods. I can see little objection to a quid pro
quo, if such were possible to arrange. Unfortunately, it is not. We buy most of our
goods from Ontario and Quebec; but those
provinces buy little, if anything, from us.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Burchill: With the best will in
the world to increase the buying of British
goods in the dollar areas, I submit that there
are three factors which enter into the picture.
The first is price; the second, exchange rate
stability, and the third, tariff. On the question of tariff I am prepared to go a long way
with the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr Roebuck); but as stability
of exchange is essential for the day to day
business of crading, I am wondering if we
have ye reached a sufficiently normal trading
period to allow currencies to find their own
levels. At the moment I am concerned chiefly
with the factor of price.
I think most honourable senators will agree
that the chief reason for the decline of purchases from Great Britain when indications

of a buyers' market appeared, was the failure
of the British goods to compete in price with
comparable United States and Canadian
goods. I can give many instances of Canadian firms who were anxious to buy British
goods having submitted their inquiries to
English manufacturers only to find, to their
dismay, that the price quoted was much
higher than that at which the same goods
could be purchased frorn the United States.
Many of the British goods on display in the
stores of Canadian cities have borne price
tags which did not interest the ordinary
buyer. While in New York last spring I was
informed by the buyer of a large importing
house that he had just returned from a buying trip to England almost empty-handed,
because he could not pay the asking price
and offer the goods for sale in New York
in competition with American-made articles.
My honourable friend from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has said that there is
no evidence to support the charge that the
cost of social services and of rnaintaining
what is known as the "welfare state," which
England has undertaken, has much to do,
if anything, with the cost of production.
Accepting that theory for the moment, I am
not satisfied that there are not factors in
such a state which overload the cost figures.
There may be psychological factors, and these
do not always appear in the balance sheet.
Accepting for the moment, as I have said,
the theory of my honourable friend, I want
to point out to the house that there is much
to justify the argument that unilateral trade
is one of the big factors in keeping up costs.
Under present circumstances, as you know,
England has been obliged to resort to trading
on a barter basis with other nations in the
sterling area. To convert raw materials so
obtained from non-competitive sources into
manufactured articles and sell the products
in competitive dollar areas is putting too great
a strain upon machinery. For that reason the
manufacturers for the most part sell in the
erling areas. They are unable to meet the
competition of the dollar area countries. It
is difficult to see how bilateral and unilateral
trading can work together if we envisage a
system of world trading.
The problem is difficult, but I am convinced
that there is a solution, and that it can be
reached by men of good will, determined to
find it. If co-operative efforts under the compulsion of war are capable of the amazing
feats which conquered a stubborn and powerful foe, surely the same genius in another
field can find a way to allow nations to
exchange goods in time of peace. I refuse to
believe that George Bernard Shaw was right

when he cynically declared that "the other
planets are using our world for a lunatic
asylum".
Indeed, honourable senators, a solution
must be found, for there is no alternative; and
in our humble way we can assist in bringing
that solution nearer. As senators, as leaders
of public opinion, and as Canadians in our
own individual spheres of influence, in the
spirit of the Washington Conference we can
endeavour to help people understand that if
sacrifices such as tariff reductions are necessary they will have to be made, and that only
by the United States and the British Commonwealth of Nations marching together in
closest economic as well as political relations
can our hopes for our future, the future of our
children and the future of our grandchildren
be realized.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
gentleman what he thinks of the suggestion
of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that there should
be a greater tax on timber limits and land
in this country?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I understood the honourable senator to be discussing English, not
Canadian politics.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, it applies all round.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
this is my fifteenth session as a member of
the Senate of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I think I have participated
i some small measure in practically every
Throne Speech debate which has taken place
in that time so I had decided that I would
keep quiet this year and give the members
a rest. But I suppose the eternal feminine
desire to talk got the better of me, and there
is one piece of legislation forecast in the
Speech from the Throne upon which I should
like to make a few remarks.
Before doing so, I would join the speakers
who have preceded me in extending my
warmest congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker,
upon your well-deserved elevation to your
present position, and to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Godbout) and seconder (Hon. Mr. Petten) of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne upon the eloquence of their presentations. I would also join those who have
preceded me in welcoming the new Senators.
But confidentially I must say something to
you. I had a few very bad moments the other
day when my leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) was
welcoming these newcomers. As he was

distinguished and respected gentlemen of the
Supreme Court seriously declared with al
solemnity, that a woman was not "a person"
under the meaning of the ActSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Varmints.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: -and therefore was not
entitled to a seat in the Senate. That decision
was handed down in all seriousness by men
high in the esteem of this country. And we
call ourselves a progressive nation! But five
able and courageous women from the western
prairies, led by Judge Emily Murphy, who
up to this point had championed the admission of women to the Senate, were not to be
daunted by anything so trifling as the decision
by the Supreme Court. They carried their
case to the Privy Council, and that body
reversed the decision of the Supreme Court
and declared a woman to be a "person" under
the meaning of the Act. Consequently we
were permitted to come in and take a place
in the Red Chamber of Canada.
By the way, perhaps some of the new
members have not noticed a bronze plaque
bearing the names of those five women, which
is on the west wall of the ante-chamber of
the Senate. That plaque was placed there
by the Canadian Federation of Business and
Professional Women.
On the eve of making this momentous
change and of placing all power in the hands
of a Canadian court, I should like to remind
my colleagues of something they already
know. Sometimes, in order to get the proper
perspective of a good painting or picture, one
stands back at some distance so that the
little details will not interfere with the
beauty of the whole. I think it has been
that situation with regard to many decisions
of the Privy Council. The very fact that
they were far removed from the scene of
action where they were unhampered and
untrammelled by petty arguments and petty
influences which might intrude themselves
upon the scene here, has enabled them at
times to give better and more unbiased
decisions than they could have given if they
had been at closer range.
I am not intimating by these remarks that
I directly oppose this legislation. When my
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) was speaking the
other day, he gave one or two very good
reasons why the change would be for the
better. I can see something of value on both
sides, but I definitely cannot see the argument
advanced in another place by the Minister of
Justice when he introduced the bill. He
hung his whole case on the fact that this
legislation needed to be passed at once in
order to bolster our national pride. I do
not like that. It smacks to me too much

of an inferiority complex, something with
which I have never been afflicted. My
national pride does not need any bolstering;
I have plenty of it without any assistance
from legislation of this kind. I do not like
this type of argument. There were arguments put forward by the leader of this
side of the house the other day which I think
are quite valid. Nevertheless, I think it
quite in order for me to bring to the attention
of members of this chamber what the right
of appeal to the Privy Council has meant to
the women of Canada.
I sincerely hope that if and when the
change takes place and the Supreme Court
of Canada becomes the court of last resort in
matters of appeals, the men who exercise the
power of making the final decision may have
a broader vision than some of their predecessors.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 11, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1950.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, I
object to the bill being read a second time
now, and I will state the reason for my
objection. I was furnished this morning, as
of right, with a copy of the detailed estimates.
When we adjourned during pleasure I left
these papers on my desk here, but now, on
coming back, I find that my desk-and
apparently every other desk in the chamberhas been cleared off. I have inquired where
my papers are, and cannot find out. On them
I had written some figures relating to questions that I wished to ask the acting leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Copp). Those
figures in themselves are not important, but
I do want the details of the estimates in front
of me, and until I receive them I shall object
to any further proceedings on the bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Honourable senators, I
quite understand the point taken by my
honourable friend. I do not know who was
responsible for removing papers from his

SEPTEMEER 29, 1949
desk, but certainly one would think they
could be found and returned. Perhaps we
might postpone proceedings while awaiting
return of the papers.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Did the honourable gentleman look inside his desk?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I locked it before leaving
earlier this afternoon, and it is stili locked.
Ail that I keep in there are sorne copies of
*old speeches. I have just unlocked
again,'
and it contains nothing but sorne it of my
speeches in cold storage. I would suggest
that the Clerk of the H'iuse send an official
to the distribution office and get copies of the
bill and the estirnates. Copies are avajiable,
for they were sent to members by mail this
morning. The Cierk Assistant kindiy sent
one to mne, as I think he did to every other
mermber. The copy I got in that way was the
one that I left on rny desk.
Hon. Mr. Copp: I think, honourabie sen~ators, that we rnight wait a few minutes to
sec if my honourabie friend's papers cannot
be found.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sureiy there is another copy
of the estimates.
Hom. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
presume that there is before us a motion to
set aside the rules so that we rnay proceed
wih second rcading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. His Honour the
Speaker asked when the bill shouid be read
a second time, and I objected.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think we ought to
have sorne explanation, if we are asked to
give second reading today.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If my friend had been
iistening hie would have heard rny explanation. I saîd that when we adjourned during
pieasure earlier thîs afternoon I lef t a copy
of the estirnates on my desk, and when I
returned the papers were gone.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I quite understood what
rny honourable friend saîd. My point is that
if we are to be asked to give second reading
to this bill today, we should have some good
explanation frorn the governrnent benches.
I received a copy of the estirnates, but I had
no idea that we were going to be asked to
put them through today. If there is any
real reason why we should do that, I think we
ought to hear it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
now have a copy of the bill, and I arn satisfied to go on.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shahl this bill be read a second tirne?
Hon. Mr. Copp: With leave, I move that
the bill be read a second time now.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Explain.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Honourable senators, this is
an interim supply bill, such as cornes before
us from tirne to tirne every session. The
expianation that has been put into rny hands
is along the foilowing lines. On March 31
this year we passed an interim. suppiy bill
which perrnitted the governrnent to carry on
the business of the country until such time
as the estimates for the fiscal year 1949-1950
could be considered and a final supply bill
passed.
Except for certain amounts, that
suppiy bill covered one-sixth of the items
se', fornh in the main estimates, or two months'
supply. Again on April 7 this house passed
ano.ýher suppiy bill. Its purpose was to vote
certain moncys for the extension of Dominion
Governoment services to Newfoundland, and
tic amount voted was one-sixth of the
supplementary estimates with respect to Newfoundland as tabled in the Senate, or two
mnonths' suppiy. On April 30 of this year
we passed another supply bill. When the
Prime Minister announced the dissolution
of parliament it became evident that further
suppiy would be needed to meet the financiai
needs 0f the country until a general election
was hehd and parliarnent was surnmoned
again. To this end we voted one-third o! the
main estimates and of the supplernentary
estimates (Newfoundland). From these three
suppiy buis it can be seen that we voted
approximately one-haîf of the main estimates
and o! the suppiernentary estirnates (Newfoundland). On a yearly basis this wouid
provide for a six-month period.
That six-months period will expire on
September 30 next, and the governrnent is
now seeking further suppiy to carry the
country until such time as the estimates are
passed and final supply voted. The honourable Minister of Finance indicated yesterday
that hie hoped this might be accomplished in
the other place about the middle o! October.
With this in mind the government has presented the bill now before us, which, if
passed, would vote one-twelfth o! the main
and supplementary estimates, with certain
additional sums. This would be approximately one month's supply, and would carry
the business of the governrnent to the end
o! October.
Section 2 of the bill before us, with the
exception of items 43, 419 and 452 would
vote one-tweifth of the main estimates. Item
43 deals with western feed grains freight
assistance, and the surn rentioned in the
main estirnates was fuhly voted. Items 419
and 452 are in the saine category. Item 419
deais with the Canadian International Trade
Fair, and item 452 with the replacernent of
materials and buildings destroyed in a fire

SENATE
at Canadian Arsenals Limited. The total
sum that would be voted under this section
is $114,516,603.83.
Section 3 would vote $2,613,651.00, or onetwelfth of the supplementary estirnates (Newfoundland). This is necessary because, as
has been mentioned, Newfoundland was not
provided for in the main estimates.
This afternoon I tabled certain further
supplementary estimates. As the business of
running the various departments of the government progresses throughout the year, it
becomes evident that certain estimates made
at the beginning of the year were too low
and that more money will be needed. In
certain cases it is found that the estimates
were too high, and that there will be a surplus. It is not possible, however, to transfer
the surpluses from those departments that
possess them to those that anticipate deficits,
and the government must return to parliament to seek further votes to cover deficits.
In addition to these deficits, certain expenditures have to be made which the govcrnment could in no way foresee at the
beginning of the year, and which are largely
caused by factors which it does not control.
This does not mean that the over-all budgetting of the government is bad, because surpluses realized at the end of the year usually
more than balance the total deficits. To
cover these deficits and unanticipatedexpenditurcs, the further supplementary estimates
have been placed before you. They cover
items either not sufficiently provided for in
the main estimates or not mentioned at all.
Section 4 of the bill would vote $5,876,758.33,
or one-twelfth of the further supplementary
estimates mentioned above.
Section 5 would vote $468,750, or fivetwelfths of the item shown in Schedule A
to the bill. This item covers the Dominion
Government's share of the cost of works
already undertaken on the Fraser River Valley, under the agreement of July 22, 1948.
This agreement was made with the province
of British Columbia to reconstruct and improve the dykes on the Fraser River Valley.
This is Vote 907 in the further supplementary
estimates.
Section 6 is a borrowing section, and
authorizes the Governor in Council to borrow moneys that may be necessary for retiring or servicing debts of the government
which fall due in the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1950. It in no way authorizes the
government to increase the debt of the
country.
The statement I have just read came to
me from the Department of Finance. Honourable senators know that the passing of
this bill in no way prejudices their right to
discuss its contents fully when the final

estimates come before this house. Ever since
I have been a member of the Senate it has
been the custom to pass the estimates in
this way, rapid though it may seem. The
other house has passed this bill and, when
it has received favourable consideration by
this house, the Deputy of His Excellency the
Governor General will come and assent to
this and another bill at 6 o'clock. For these
reasons, I move second reading of the bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I have always had a strange feeling when
bills for supplementary estimates have been
brought before this house. The honourable
leader of the government always makes the
statement, and it is of course true, that we
may discuss the whole problem when the
final estimates come before us. But for the
nfteen years in which I have been a me.mber
of this house the final estimates have not
been considered until the last afternoon of
the session.
Now, honourable senators, I do not believe
that the Senate is making its proper contribution to the discussion of budget matters.
I an not so much concerned about the details
of the financial business of the country as I
am about the general financial policy. I
think that the present way of voting supply
is a hopeless muddle.
During the past two days we have listened
to several speeches in this house: I refer
particularly to the remarks of the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable member from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), both of whom
expressed themselves strongly on the present
financial situation. One does not need to be
a prophet or the son of a prophet to realize
that our country is facing a crisis. If the
honourable member from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) was correct this afternoon, when he voiced concern for the
province of New Brunswick, it appears to
me that we shall have difficulty in selling
timber to Europe and the United Kingdom.
I have noticed the reports-I am not an
authority on the subject-that the Scandinavian countries have depreciated their
moneys 30 per cent. Great Britain is now
negotiating for newsprint and other timber
products from those countries, and with our
currency depreciated 10 per cent we cannot
hope to compete with them for this market.
I listened carefully to the speeches of both
the honourable member from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) and the honourable member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I think I got more from the second speaker
than from the first. While I may disagree
in part with them, I am forced to the conclusion that the sterling countries are in a
very difficult position. United States and

SEPTEMBER 29, 1949
Canadian loans and Marshall Plan funds
have gone by the board, and Great Britain
is in greater difficulties now than ever before.
The leader of one of her political parties
has said that the field should be wide open
so that money can find its own value.
While I agree largely with my friend from
Toronto-Trinity, I fail to draw from his
remarks, or from those of the senator from
Inkerman, what is suggested in the way of
a solution. It is so easy to utter high-sounding phrases about Great Britain, because of
ber part in the war, her sacrifices and the
loss of her world investments, and to say that
therefore we, or the United States should get
behind ber and put up the money.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am just stating what has
been said on the subject.
Hon. Mr. Duff: What is the solution?
Hon. Mr. Haig: If my honourable friend
will just have patience, be will hear what
I think about the solution.
Canada faces a grave problem. It affects
the western provinces and the Maritimes to
some extent, but Ontario and Quebec are
little affected. We in the West have one
prima.ry product-wheat. Up to the present
time it has been largely sold on European
markets. My friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) referred to the three-way
system of trading. Although he did not say
so, it would seem to follow from his argument, if one examines it closely, that what
Britain received from the United States was
used to pay us, and that we used that money
to meet our debts to the United States. What
he did not mention, though it is the fact, is
that for very many years part of the money
obtained by Great Britain from the United
States was by way of return from investments; and of course large sums came also
from investments in Canada. What I want
from honourable gentlemen opposite-for the
information of the farmers and fishermen
of my province, the lumbermen of British
Columbia and New Brunswick, the apple
growers of Nova Scotia, the potato growers
of Prince Edward Island, and other Canadian
producers-is a statement of what they propose as a solution of the problem we have
run into.
I have listened over the air to many
addresses and I have read the very able press
of my own city; prior to the lst of May I
heard many discussions in this bouse and in
another place, and later I listened to the campaign speeches of the parties; but as yet I
have never heard from the government
one suggestion as to how they are going to
meet this difflculty. What they say amounts
to this: "We have got through crises in the

past. Trust us to get through them again."
And the people have done so. Now this crisis
is upon us, and I want to know how the
government are going to meet it.
As the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) said today, the
government told us on the platform, in the
press, over the radio and in the other place
that they would never devalue the money of
this country. My honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck)-to
whom I give the most credit-followed very
closely by myself, criticized the government
for fixing our dollar at par in 1946. We told
them they should have "held the line" at
90 cents. They pooh-poohed the idea; they
laughed at us. Well, within two and a half
months of the election they have depreciated
our currency 10 per cent, and I predict that
the bottom is not yet reached; they will have
to come down some more. That is our situation.
There is no point in using high-flown phrases
about what we are going to do for Great
Britain. We could spend our time more
profitably in trying to decide what we can do
for ourselves. That is the problem we have
to face.
I am not going to formally object to any of
the estimates: it would not have any effect if
I did. I would only point out that the estimates before us are on the same fine scale
of spending that bas prevailed for the past
eight or nine years. While the world was a
buyer's market and people had to have goods
and would pay any price for them, it was easy
to drift along.
This afternoon my honourable friend from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) criticized the representatives of the West for
kicking about the wheat agreement. It may
be true that our farmers have done very well,
but they were entitled to do a lot better. I
realize that it is not necessary to warn the
Maritimes, Newfoundland, and the three
western provinces that we have got to find
some way to sell our primary products.
British Columbia, although in a rather different position, is also largely affected. The
people of Ontario and Quebec have had cheap
living at the expense of the rest of Canada.
They need a better understanding of the producers' problems, and the sooner they realize
that the better.
We are now faced with the imminent disappearance of the principal markets for our
primary products. I protest most vehemently
against the attitude af a government who
assured us on May 21 that they will not depreciate money and within six months proceed
to devalue it. In my judgment the end is not
yet. Something is wrong. The government
should have a long-term policy and tell the
people of Canada what it is.

SENATE
Recently our ministers went to Washington. One of them, the lVinister of Finance,
announced, "We shall listen to what the
British have to say as to what they want to
do." What did the British say? I don't know.
They used a lot of high-sounding words, and
suggested that we invest our money in the
sterling area. But who, if he had any sense,
would invest private capital in Britain today,
being unable to get it out and with the
prospect of having it stuck theie forever?
Would you do that? Not if you had any
brains. Why should anybody invest in any of
these countries from which our money cannot be withdrawn? We know that if somebody in Great Britain wants to come to
Canada, or go to Australia or some other
overseas country, all he is allowed to take
with him is a pittance. I do not know the
exact amount which may be released per
year, but it is not very much.
This, in short, is the situation we in Canada
have to face. It is for the government to tell
us what their solution is. Some member of
this chamber may ask me, "What, Mr. Winnipeg, is your suggestion?" Well, I did not get
the country into this mess. I had nothing to
do with il. It may be that the government
can provide a solution. For the last six or
seven years they have taken an astute course;
all they have said is, "Wait and see". But I
think we are at the end of the waiting period.
As an honourable member pointed out this
afternoon, no longer can we sell our lumber
and timiber in the old markets of Europe, and
after this year we shall not be able to sell
our wheat there, either. I saw an announcement in today's paper that the United States
have released $10 million to be spent in
Canada for flour. Why, in the wheat and flour
industry $10 million is nothing, compared
witb the $280 million spent this year for 140
million bushels of our wheat, to say nothing
of purchases of bacon, eggs, cheese and other
products. As for fish, in the presence of the
honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) an expert on
this subject, I shall say very little. I do not
know half or a quarter as much about it as
he does. But I notice in the report tabled
here a few days ago that up to the end of
March $532,000-which is provided for in
this estimate--was spent on a small operation
in that product. I do not know how much
has been lost up to date. It was announced
yesterday that the government undertook to
advance a million and a half dollars towards
the purchase of apples, principally from Nova
Scotia and British Columbia. What about
Ontario and Quebec? They produce apples
too.
I trust that when the Minister of Finance
makes his budget speech he will outline

clearly what his policy is to be. I do not
want him to tell me that he is not going to
devalue money any further, for I shall not
believe him if he does. In that respect he
is in the Cripps class. Sir Stafford Cripps
asserted up to the night before he devalued
the British pound that he would never
devalue it. The British people credited him
with being a steadfast politician. He landed
in England on Saturday night, and on Monday
morning the pound was devalued. The same
kind of thing happened here. There was to
e no devaluation; yet now we have it. Are
we to bave more of il? What is the policy
of the government with relation to primary
produets? How are they going to meet the
problem of finding markets?
Incidentally, I wish that somebody in the
House of Commons would explain the system
which is being worked out to deal with
western Canada's oats and barley. I cannot
understand the basis on which they are being
traded in on the Winnipeg market. If the
Winnipeg market means anything, it means
thAt when you sell goods you sell them to a
person who demands your product. Surely
a man on the Winnipeg market would not
put on the board quotations for the seling of
oats and barley unless he had some arrangement with the Wheat Board to deliver lhe
commodities. However, this was not intended
to be. The idea was to absolutely wipe out
the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. The Minister
of Trade and Commerce should state publicly
what the government's policy is with respect
to the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. If he cannot do it, then the leader or deputy leader of
the government in this house should do so.
My friends fro-n the rural parts of Manitoba
claimed that the elimination of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange would be a great boon
to the farmers. But has the Grain Exchange

was on a par with the American dollar, but
today it is only worth ninety American cents.
What will our dollar be worth tomorrow?
When we come to the actual budget debate
I should like these questions to be answered
by the government leader in this house. I
am giving this notice now so that neither he
nor his deputy can say to me, "At this late
stage it is impossible to get the information".
If I had my way we would adjourn for a
couple of weeks so that my honourable friends
would have ample time to gather the necessary information. I think the deputy leader,
who is a pretty good parliamentarian, should
join with his leader in seeking from the
Minister of Trade and Commerce and the
Minister of Finance the answer to these
questions.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has just delivered another of his vigorous
speeches. The only trouble is that it had
nothing whatsoever to do with the motion
before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I object to my honourable
friend's remarks. I was discussing matters
related to the estimates before us.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I repeat that it had
nothing whatsoever to do with the motion
before the house.
My honourable friend was all for co-operation when he delivered his brief oration on
the motion to adopt the Address. I was
really touched by the remarks he directed to
the new senators, particularly to our friends
from Newfoundland. We were told that we
must forget partisanship in this house, and
forget that we are Liberals.
My honourable friend from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) delivered a most interesting
address this afternoon, and as usual her
speech was excellent. One of the things she
sought light upon was the meaning of this
business of co-operation, but I scarcely
expected that her remarks would so quickly
produce an effect upon the leader of the
opposition.
He criticized the government
here, there and everywhere and, although he
may be right in his criticism, he was talking
about matters entirely outside the bounds of
this motion. What is this motion? It is not
a budget debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I rise to a point of order.
This is a supply bill, and this is a budget
debate; therefore I am entitled to talk about
anything I like. I would ask for a ruling.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is not necessary to get
a ruling.

Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend did
not challenge my right to speak before, but
he is doing so now. This is certainly a budget
debate.
Hon. Mr. King: You have made your speech.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This is not a budget
debate. What is before us is not legislation
to increase or reduce taxation in any form.
It is a motion to vote supplies to His Majesty,
in order that the business of this country
may be carried on. That is what this is,
and my honourable friend would realize this
perfectly well if he would give the matter
his usual full reflection.
Honourable senators, I admit that at the
proper time there may be room for wide
debate on questions such as the marketing of
oats and barley. I agree, too, that our export
and import problems are vital, and I do not
particularly quarrel with the essence of what
my honourable friend stated so vigorously.
I agree with him that the government should
give more detailed information; but I say
that much of what the leader opposite has said
does not come within the motion before us.
As the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Copp) explained, the motion is to grant one month's
supply to His Majesty. This money is being
sought so that, among other things, salaries
can be paid, coal can be purchased for the
heating of government buildings, and the expenses incidental to running the business of
this house can be paid. If these funds were
not voted, the money to pay the indemnity of
my honourable friend for the coming month
would not be available. It would be a sad
thing for me-though perhaps not for my
honourable friend-if the money were not
available to pay that portion of the indemnity
which is due us at the end of October.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Argument ad hominem.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I might even have to go
to my honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to see if I could
raise a loan.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think it is important
that we keep our discussion as close as possible to the matter in hand. I had not the
slightest intention of rising to my feet, but
my honourable friend delivered a rather
heavy attack upon the government in relation to matters that have nothing to do
with this motion, and it is for this reason
that I have made these observations.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
am sorry to disagree with the last speaker.
I by no means concur in all that was said by
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.

That is a purely academic point at the

But the matter is important, because there

of interest, as is permissible in the circumstances. The leader of the opposition says

debate on all kinds of matttrs is permissible,

just as it is when we are debating the motion
for an Address in reply to the Speech from the

to the government benches, I am ready to

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
September 29, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. Godbout for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, it is always a pleasure to welcome
new senators to this house, and I desire to
extend a hearty welcome to those honourable
gentlemen who have come here for the first
time this session. It is, I think, a matter of
gratification to us all that two of the new
senators assumed the responsibilities, respectively, of moving and seconding the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I
desire to join with the speakers who have
preceded me in this debate in offering heartfelt congratulations to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Godbout) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Petten)
upon the excellent presentations they made.
The mover is well known as a distinguished
public man, one who in the past held the high
office of Premier of the province of Quebec.
With his wide experience in public affairs
and a keen appreciation of their importance
he combines great generosity of heart, and I
do not think anyone would deny that his
appointment is a great acquisition to this
house. The appointment of the seconder is
also a great acquisition to the Senate. He has
the distinction of representing Canada's tenth
and newest province, Newfoundland. As I
listened to the mover and seconder I was

points they made the completeness with which
they dealt with it, I feel that there is little
that I can say without going over the ground
already covered. All I wish to do is to
emphasize one or two points which occurred
to me in reading their respective speeches,
and then to say a word or two on the
question of devaluation.
I am glad the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is in his
seat, because, in dealing with what he said
about the crisis, and attaching to his wordswhich I shall quote-the interpretation they
seem to bear, I realize that they may not
express exactly what he meant. He is here
to correct me if I am wrong. The house will
recall the excellent presentation he made.
The point to which I propose to allude is of
vital importance in connection with this very
serious predicament in which we, in common
with the other great trading nations of the
world, now find ourselves. On September 28
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity,
in referring to the seriousness of the situation said, in part, as reported on page 51 of
Hansard:
It is peculiarly a disaster to Canada because, in
the three-cornered trading system of the past, Canadians have paid the net debit for the many commodities purchased by us in the United States by
our sales in the British market, and the United
Kingdom squared her account with us-and incidentally ours with the United States-by the excess
of her exports over imports in ber dealings with the
United States.

As I see it, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity would be quite correct if he
included the exports of the whole sterling
area as well as those of the United Kingdom.
We always sold more to Britain than we
bought from Britain, and we always sold less
to the United States than we bought from the
United States; and the trade was balanced
by an excess of exports from all sources in
the sterling area over imports from the
United States. It is important to draw this
distinction because, if my honourable friend
was merely referring to the United Kingdom,
I would point out that year in and year out
Britain's exports to the United States have
never exceeded her imports from that country. Actually, Canada's trading position with
the United Kingdom has been exactly the
same as that of the United States. Perhaps
there has been a degree of difference, but
always there has been a deficit. This is not
a vital matter but I wanted to clear up the
point, because there is the implied suggestion
that if, before the war, it were purely a
matter of Britain's exports to the United
States exceeding her imports from that country, our position would be the same as it
formerly was just as soon as pre-war conditions of trade return between the United

States and the United Kingdom. The distinction is definite, and was dealt with quite
clearly by my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and I refer to it
because it has some bearing on what I intend
to say later. As honourable senators know,
Great Britain has practically been the banker
for the whole sterling area. In addition to
her own exports to the United States as a
source of dollars, she has had the inestimable
advantage of having three other sources
which she utilized in paying the deficit to the
United States as well as to ourselves.
I read now from the remarks of the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), which appear at page 47 in Senate
Hansard.
Before the war India and other countries of the
Near and Far East which are comprised in the
sterling area imported very little from this continent.

That is to say, from the dollar area.
In fact they sold a great deal more to this continent than they bought from it. In other words,
as members of the sterling area they had a large
dollar balance in their favour, and that dollar balance was in fact so large that it is said to have
made up for Great Britain's own dollar deficit.
But since the war that condition bas completely
changed. India and the other countries of the Near
and Far East now demand the goods of this continent. They import today a great deal more from
this continent than they export to it, and instead
of helping to make up Great Britain's deficit of
dollars they account an their own for an additional
deficit estimated at about £100 million a year.

I am sure my honourable friend from
Inkerman is correct. Honourable senators
probably received a copy of addresses made
by the Right Honourable Harold Wilson,
President of the United Kingdom Board of
Trade, who visited this country on behalf of
British trade. In speaking to the Institute of
Export on his return to the United Kingdom,
he corroborated this point. I quote from his
remarks:
We are in fact today paying for a far higher
proportion of our dollar imports by our own exports
and re-exports than we were before the war, but
other means of financing the deficit we had then,
the income on our dollar investments and the vast
proceeds of sales of sterling area produce, are not
able to make their pre-war contribution in the
post-war world. Before the war our sales of sterling
area produce to the United States were enough,
taken together with our investment income and
other invisibles, not merely to bridge the whole of
our trading deficit with the United States but also
to provide a large surplus of United States dollars
with which to bridge our gap with Canada. But
one essential prop of that pre-war quadrilateral
system, sterling area sales to the United States,
bas been virtually knocked away.

Honourable senators, what I mean to suggest is that two of the major sources which
were at Britain's command in pre-war days,
and which enabled her to adjust her trade
deficits with ourselves and the United States,
have disappeared, and probably will not

SENATE
reappear for a long time-indeed, probably
flot during the lifetime of any honourable
senator here. There is no escaping the fact
that if, in the future trade economy of
Canada, it is deemed desirable to continue
to seli a considerable amount of our surplus
to the United Kingdom, we cannot expcct
to return to conditions prior to the war,
when we did flot have to take a considerable
amount of British goods. However painful
it may be, we must recognize this fart,
because trade habits established over a long
span of years are flot easily altered. Trade
habits are flot changed as far as the producers,
who have been used to selling in other
markets, are roncerned; they are flot changed
as far as the buyers are conrerned; and il
becomes a painful process to the buyers if
they have to take an additional one, two or
three hundred million dollars' worth of goods
from the United Kingdom in order that wc
rnay maintain. even our presrit level of
e-xports t0 that country.
As the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) summed it up, devaluation is only
a start on a very long and tedious road. I
can already sce signs of difficulties that wil]
arise. My honourable friend from Northumborland (Hon. Mr. Burchillb, in an excellent
speech, pointed out that already there arc
difficulties in the Maritime provinces, where
w,,e have almost cnmpletely lost our market
for apples and for lumber, and said that we
would huy Britishi goods if the British kept
their prices down. I do flot know that I amn
quite sa optilTistic.

Now I turn for a few moments to the
question of exchange control and devaluation, which was referred to by various
speakers in this debate.
Honourable senators will rerali that immediately on the outbreak of war our exehange was placed under
control, by virtue of the War Measures Act.
The British pound was devalued to, I think,
$4.04 in terras of the American dollar, a discount of about 20 per cent. and our own
dollar xvas devalued about 10 per cent, to a
rate which was maintained during the wxhole
period of the xvar. Early in 1946 a bill was
passed giving statutory form to foreign
exchange control. There was a gond deal of
discussion and difference of opinion about it,
but the measure became law, subi ert, I think,

-it could apply to the International Monetary Fund for approval of a change in the
rate of exchange from that set by the fund,
and any such application could be granted
or rejected.
At the moment these details are not very
important. But honourable senators will
recall that complementary to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund
there was another great effort made, at the
Geneva Conference, to get the wheels of
international trade moving. At that gathering, despite a good many restrictions of one
kind and another, there was worked out a
system of tariff reductions, through which
we received conceivably important concessions in the American market. The general
agreement on tariffs and trade reached at
the Geneva Conference set up the International Monetary Fund as the regulating body
in matters of foreign exchange. It must be
quite obvious to honourable senators that if
Canada or the United States or any other
great trading country reduced its tariffs in
favour of another country to a degree greater
than that which could be made without the
consent of the International Monetary Fund,
the question would at once arise whether the
benefits so created in favour of any country
would not be immediately nullified in the
event of a severe currency depreciation. So
it was part and parcel of the agreement with
regard to reduction of tariffs that there should
be control of exchange within certain limits;
and, as I said a moment ago, the International Monetary Fund was set up as the
regulating body. Now, it is possible to
become a party to the tariff agreement without being a member of the monetary fund,
but in such case article XV, section 6, of the
tariff agreement says that a party not a
member of the monetary fund must enter into
special foreign exchange agreements with
any party with which it wishes to contract.
The same section further provides that any
signatory to the tariff agreement who ceases
to be a member of the monetary fund shall
immediately enter into foreign exchange
agreements with any parties it contracts with.
These exchange agreements must set a rate
of exchange for the currencies involved.
Once this rate is set and the exchange agreement concluded, section 6(b) of Article II of
the tariff agreement becomes operative. It
provides that once such an agreement is made
to set the rate of exchange between currencies, then any changes in such rate of
exchange shall be governed by the same
rules that apply to changes in the rates of
exchange of members of the monetary fund.
Thus, once the exchange rates are set by
agreement, the parties are, for all practical

purposes, members of the monetary fund,
with the one important exception that they
have no voice in the regulation of the fund.
In other words, honourable senators, should
we elect to withdraw from the International
Monetary Fund, and at the same time wish
to enjoy certain advantages in the United
States market, it is quite within the power
of the fund to require us to act in the same
way as if we were members. Of course if
we choose to play the part of the lone wolf,
and be entirely indifferent to tariff regulations of other countries, that would be a
different matter.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask if the International Monetary Fund consented to the
reduction by 10 per cent of the Canadian
dollar?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No consent is required
for a devaluation of 10 per cent. Of course
the devaluation of British currency by 30 per
cent obviously requires consent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Did the fund consent to
the reduction of 30 per cent in the case of
the British currency?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, it consented.
Indeed, in the report of the fund, issued a
few days previous to the devaluation it urged
Great Britain to devalue. I do not say that
she was urged to devalue by 30 per cent, but
she was certainly requested to devalue to
some extent. Inasmuch as the request was
made, I fancy that the directors had been
considering the case for some time, and consent was quickly given.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was the procedure the
same with regard to the other countries
which devalued their currencies much more
than 10 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Haig: If they belonged to the
fund, the procedure would be the same.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes; they all asked for
authority.
Hon. Mr. Euler: For instance, Argentina's
currency went down 40 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not know that
she was a member of the International Monetary Fund. I am not sufficiently versed in
the law in that respect to know all the
intricacies of the agreements and regulations
surrounding the fund.
I have been interested in one point for
which I have not been able to find the complete answer. It is this: If Britain asked for
and obtained the consent of the fund to
devalue her pound by 30 per cent, and her
exports to the United States were substantially increased, would the fact that the fund

SENATE
agreed to the devaluation remove the possibility of the United States taking dumping
action aaginst such an extreme devaluation?
As I say, I have not been able to find the
answer, but from my reading I am inclined
to think that in the case of any devaluation
in excess of 20 per cent-Hon. Mr. Haig: In excess of 10 per cent.

Hon. Mr. Haig: And she is now selling gold
at very much above the average price. The
United States, I understand, wants her to stop
doing so, but South Africa refuses to change
her policy in this respect. Is any machinery
provided for taking action in such a situation?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I thank my honourable friend for the question, because by it he
gives me credit for knowing a great deal
more about this complicated question than
i actually do know.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am speaking of
devaluation of over 20 per cent. I understand that even with the consent of the fund,
should the United States, for instance, protest that the price at which goods were being
shipped to her constituted dumping, she
would be entitled to ask for and make new
agreements with respect to the devaluation
of more than 20 per cent. I do not express
that as a final opinion on the matter; I merely
call the attention of honourable senators to
the fact that the whole Geneva Trade Agreement contemplates some control of currencies,
either through the medium of the International Monetary Fund or by separate agreement.
It may interest honourable senators to
know that at the moment there are 46 countries represented in the fund. I know of only
three countries which currently are not
imembers-Burma, New Zealand and Southern
Rhodesia. The fund has a large membership,
and apparently contributes to a general world
currency stabilization.
Concerning the question of whether or not
we should control our foreign exchange, I
would say that under the extraordinary conditions which we faced following the recent
war, and which we may now face, the collective opinion of a great many countries seems
to favour control.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I am reluctant to a:k a
question which the honourable leader might
not be reasonably expected to answer. Of
course it is quite all right if that is the case.
I would refer again to what the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) said. As England has devalued 30
per cent, and Canada 10 per cent, the Britisher
gets an advantage of 20 per cent in the
Canadian market. May Canada, if she so
desires, compensate herself for that differential by an increased tariff?
While I am on my feet I might also ask
another question. I am informed that Britain
subsidizes some exports to this country. One
of these products is leather; there nay be
others. Could we under these circurmstances
provide for a dumping duty? Or, as I have
said, can the tariff be increased to conpensate for that difference of 20 per cent?

Hon. Mr. Farris: Is it true that if Canada
withdrew her support from the Canadian
dollar, she would either have to withdraw
fron the International Monetary Fund or get
its consent?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Realizing my responsibility for what I say in answering the
honourable senator's question, I should like
to make it clear, that I am giving only my
own interpretation of the provisions.

I think the
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
actual agreement covers capital movement
and not mroneys used currently. There are
one or two alternatives open to Canada. If
she remains a member of the International
Monetary Fund she must undertake to control her foreign exchange. Should she withdraw from the fund, and wish to enjoy
certain benefits extended by other countries,
she must enter into agreements which require
her to do practically the same as if she were
a member of the fund.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps I should not have
asked.

Hon. Mr. Haig: As I understand it, South
Africa belongs to the monetary fund?

Hon. Mr. Euler: But would it not apply
if the British manufacturers receive a
subsidy?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think so.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I was not trying to catch
my friend.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not know the
answer. I would point out that this whole
question and its related subjects are of tremendous importance, and could very well
provide an excellent ground of activity for
one of our committees.

H-on. Mr. Roberison: I am loath to give toc
positive an opinion because, as anyone who
reads them will find, the provisions are very
involved.
But as I understand them, the
right under the agreement to take action
arises only w-hen the difference is over 20 per
cent, and therefore, since we devalued 10 per
cent and Britain 30 per cent, it would not
apply in the case my honourable friend refers
to.

OCTOBER 4, 1949
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Apparently the spirit
of the thing is that the permission to devalue
at a higher rate than 10 per cent represents
an attempt to adjust a fundamental disequilibrium. As a matter of fact, United States
monetary authorities, as well as a great many
people in this country, were saying to Britain
"You must devalue." As I understand it,
according to the spirit of the agreement, if the
United States or Canada could show that the
price at which an imported article was being
offered for sale in those countries clearly
amounted to dumping as defined in the tariff
Acts, they would have the right to approach
the exporting country and ask for a new
arrangement with regard to that particular
item.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But they could not apply
a dumping duty?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would not undertake
to answer that question, because I do not
know.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I have noticed in looking
over items in price lists which have been
received from English exporters since devaluation, that the prices are just in line with
those of Canada. Previously they were very
much out of line; and it is evident that the
British do not want to get down to a basis
of dumping, they merely want to enter on a
fair footing. As regards the three or four
different items in which I happen to be interested, they are quoting Canadian prices.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Probably there is a
great deal in what my honourable friend says.
It is commonly known that one of the great
difficulties encountered in getting the British
manufacturer to ship to the dollar area was
that either he lost money by doing so or his
margin of profit was very much lower than it
was within the sterling area. Of course, to
the ordinary British manufacturer, his
country's need of dollars is an abstract question. He will never see the dollars; all be
sees is sterling; and business is business. The
price may be the same as ours, as my honourable friend from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird)
has said, but the British manufacturer may
have to ship with prospects of a smaller profit
than he can get elsewhere.
I wish now to refer briefly to the question
of whether the government was right or
wrong in restoring the dollar to par some
months after statutory control of exchange
was obtained. In matters of this kind there
is always room for argument, but, as a member of the government which took the action,
I am confident that, all things considered, it
was a wise course at that time.
Now I would deal with the present devaluation. Let me suggest what benefits have

accrued to us. First, in the intervening
period very considerable quantities of goods,
have been acquired to replenish the capital
equipment of this country: also, large
amounts of consumer goods have been purchased. May I remind honourable senators
that one effect of changing the value of the
dollar from 90 cents to par was to reduce
the tariff 10 per cent. I am bound to admit
that what has taken place recently has had
the reverse effect. But in the intervening
period capital equipment required in this
country, amounting to many hundred of
millions of dollars, was obtained for 10 per
cent less than would otherwise have been
the case. So much from the importation
point of view. From the standpoint of exports, I doubt whether the effect was
materially adverse. Theoretically it became
more difficult for our exporters to do
business. Honourable senators will remember
that as regards one of our most important
exports, namely pulp and paper, it was so
much a sellers' market that almost automatically our producers secured
from
American customers an increase in the price
of newsprint corresponding to the loss resulting from the alteration in the exchange value
of the dollar. I presume this increase would
not have been obtained if the dollar had been
left where it was. Of course certain gold
interests were injuriously affected, but some
of them were compensated by subsidy to
practically the extent of their losses. Had
the dollar remained where it was, I do not
believe that our exports to the United States
would have been much increased. Remember,
during the greater part of that period we
had very little to sell. Rightly or wrongly,
our great surpluses were involved in the
food contracts with Great Britain.
Again, had the dollar remained at a 90
cent value, it would have been incorporated
in our economy in the intervening period
upon that basis, and when the crisis arose
upon the devaluation of the pound, the urge
to devalue the dollar would probably have
been as great as has occurred with the dollar
at par. I do not deny that there are arguments the other way; but thinking upon the
action which bas been taken and its possible
effects, good or ill, and realizing that it is
only one factor bearing upon the general
business of this country, I believe that if
bringing the dollar back to par did not do
this country any great good, neither did it
do any great harm.
Almost four years ago I was first entrusted
with the responsibility of being government
leader in this house. I remember the occasion
as well as if it were yesterday. When I first
appeared here in that capacity I had already
attended a few government meetings, and

SENATE

was impressed by the serious problems with
which this country was bound to be faced
in the ensuing four years. Had I then
prophesied to this house anything that has
happened in the intervening period, I should
have thought that I was a very rash prophet.
But I want honourable senators to remember
that in the intervening period one and threequarter million people have been absorbed
into peacetime activities. There have been
more jobs than workers, and we have brought
into Canada hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Business bas been better than ever
before. The cash income to farmers last
year was four times what it was in 1938.
Our finances, private and public, are in
excellent shape. Our people have been able
to save money, and at present there are
7 million bank accounts, 21 million more than
ten years ago, and there are $2½ billion more
in these accounts. Last year we bought three
tirnes as much life insurance as we did ten
years ago. There has been a tremendous
decrease in the mortgage indebtedness of our
agricultural communities, and a relatively
increased income for our primary producers.
We are well abreast of the most-favoured
nations of the earth in the enactment of
social legislation. Our government's financial
position is sound, and it bas been possible
to assist the various provincial governments,
particularly in the less favourably placed
areas. They are in a more advantageous
position than ever before. While government expenditure has increased greatly as
compared with the pre-war expenditure, in
1.949 we were able to return to pre-war
income tax exemptions.
I should like to refer now to the recent
action of the government in devaluing the
dollar. I noticed that one or two members of
the opposition could not resist the temptation
to refer to the sudden change of mind which
has been attributed to Sir Stafford Cripps in
regard to the devaluation of the English
pound sterling. Somebody has mentioned that
during the last session our Minister of Finance said in definite terms that he would
never devalue the dollar, or words to that
effect. Honourable senators, I have carefully
read the debates of another place, and I have
seen little, if anything, to support that suggestion. Throughout his speech, the Honourable Mr. Abbott was careful to insist that in
the face of changing conditions he was making no predictions as to the future attitude
of the government. At page 1759 of last
session's House of Commons Hansard, he
said:
I certainly have no intention of stating what government policy might be under contingencies as yet
undeveloped.

Again, at page 1568 of the same Hansard he
said:
The last thing the government wants to do is to
take a rigid attitude to exchange rate questions.

On the assumption that the prevailing rates
of foreign exchange would continue in the
countries with which Canada is concerned,
the Honourable Mr. Abbott confined his
desire to keep the Canadian dollar at par for
a further period. At page 1573 of the House
of Commons Hansard for 1948-49, he said:
I have tried to examine, as carefully as I could,
all the grounds which I have seen put forward for
dissatisfaction with the present rates, and in the
present circumstances I can find no basis for believing that the present rate is unrealistic or that it
should be altered.

Whether the Canadian dollar should have
been devalued following the drastic devaluation of the English pound, is a matter that is
open to discussion. As far as I am able to
determine, there has been little commendation or criticism throughout the country. I
think this is probably so because of the
immense problem involved and the great
uncertainty as to what the future holds. If
I were a member of the opposition I think I
could make a pretty fair argument that it
would have been better to have stood our
ground and held our dollar at par. However, in the great uncertainty that lies ahead,
no one really knows. Conditions are not
unlike those which faced us at the outbreak
of war. We were a debtor country to the
United States and a creditor country to
Great Britain, and we were uncertain as to
what course we should follow. At the outbreak of war we immediately took up a position half way between, and it will remain to
be seen whether we have done the wise thing
this time. It is an important matter, and it
must be remembered that whatever "shot in
the arm" devaluation gives to business now,
it may prove serious later on. When devaluation was announced, there was activity in
South African gold mining stocks in London;
but recently I read that the labourers in the
South African mines were demanding a 30
per cent increase in wages. Therefore, if
mining costs become inflated, we will find
that our present benefits are temporary in
nature.
Honourable senators, I have no particular
knowledge as to whether or not the government bas done the wise thing, but I think
the consensus of opinion is that it has. Those
who are best informed on public financial
affairs are the most hesitant about expressing
an opinion as to the possible future results
of this drastic change. However, I think
we have got to pin our faith to this policy.
Canada is a great country, with a wealth

OCTOBER 4, 1949
of natural resources. Our business structure
has probably never been more sound. Our
agricultural situation also is sound, and the
experience of the past has led our farmers
to pay for their agricultural indebtedness.
Canada has discovered and developed great
natural resources. But there is one lesson
we should learn: we must have freer world
trade. Sometimes we accuse our Conservative friends of opposing it; and while we
Liberals pay lip service to it, we sometimes
do not practise it. We come back to it now
because the tragic forces of events are bringing us to it. My honourable friend, the leader
opposite, said he would like me to take time
off to find out the future policy of the government. I do not think it would be difficult
to lay it down in black and white. I promise
him that, as far as possible, we shall give
to this country the same courageous and farsighted administration in dealing with the
problems that lie ahead in the next four
years as we did to the problems which faced
us at the end of the war in 1945. I do not
think the severest critic doubts that the
government, supported by the efforts of the
Canadian people, will meet whatever obstacle
arises and deal with it wisely.
In closing I should like to quote a sentence
uttered by President Truman in an address
to the fourth annual conference of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund. In
suggesting a formula for expanding world
trade he said:

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no, there was
nothing faltering about my honourable
friend's remarks. It was an excellent speech,
and I listened to it with deep interest. I
only wonder if I am right in the summary
of it that I have in my mind: that he was
expressing the reasonableness of the action

taken by the government to control currency,
rather than attempting to justify the general
principles involved.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. Turgeon moved the second
reading of Bill E, an Act to incorporate
Alberta Natural Gas Company.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to make any extended speech on
this motion. The bill is the same as one
that was passed by the Senate last session,

that it was not passed by the House of Commons before prorogation. The bill gives to
the company a charter similar in effect to a
charter that a group or company might secure
from the Secretary of State or from a provincial government. By that I mean that the

bill here.
45785-7

SENATE
Frankly, there is opposition to the bill. I
understand that the petition presented this
evening by the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) outlines
some of this opposition. If the motion for
second reading is passed, I shall immediately
move for reference to the Committee on
Transport and Communications, where I
assume that all who are opposed to the bill
will have ample opportunity to make themselves heard. Any questions that honourable
senators may have about the bill or the general subject of the piping of gas, whether
from one province to another or to the United
States, may also be dealt with in committee.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the petition oppose
the principle of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The petition was presented only this evening, and I have not
read it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Ordinarily when we give
second reading to a bill we approve of the
principle of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, and ordinarily the
bill is then sent on to committee, which I
assume will be done in this case. As the
mover of the motion I shall have the right
to speak later, if the motion is seriously
opposed, but I think it will not be necessary
to go into details in the Senate this evening.
I suggest that the whole matter could be
considered in detail by the committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This bill contemplates
the exportation of gas from Canada?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I wish to say a few words on this bill
at the present time. As I am presently
advised, I am opposing the bill.
I agree with my honourable friend from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), that the final
decision of any member of the Senate should
be reserved until the facts are fully disclosed
in the inquiry which takes place before the
Transport and Communications Committee.
There are, however, one or two features which
I wish to clear up. In the first place, I want
to make my own position clear.
Some honourable senators may have
noticed that the West Coast Transmission
Company, which has filed a petition here in
opposition, made an application before the
Board of Transport Commissioners last week,
which, after partial consideration, was
adjourned until December 12. I appeared
before the Board as counsel for the company,
and the western papers reported that I was
a director of the company and appeared
in that capacity. This was not correct. I am
not a director of this company; I am not

even a shareholder; and I have no interest
whatever, of a financial nature. That is by
way of a personal explanation.
Before I proceed to discuss the conflict
between the two companies concerned, and
to answer the question of my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), may
I say that I have been reading Beauchesne,
and have improved my mind to some extent.
I believe we senators sometimes are lax in
the attention we pay to the rules. According
to Beauchesne's handbook, the second reading of private bills differs from the second
reading of public bills, in that the assent on
second reading is only a conditional assent.
I interpret that to mean that after the issue
of the facts that necessarily arise out of a
controversy of this kind has been threshed
out before a committee, the house is at liberty
to either confirm the conditional consent or
to refuse it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Of course one can always
vote against a bill on third reading.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is true. It is on that
interpretation of the rules that I have
refrained from asking for a vote at this time
but I do feel, honourable senators, that some
brief outline of the points in controversy
should be brought to the attention of the
members of the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In that way honourable
senators may get a more intelligent understanding of what is going on.
It is proposed to transport gas from Alberta
to the Pacific Coast, serving the cities of
Vancouver, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland.
That of course means export outside of Canada. I think my honourable friend from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) will agree that
the Canadian market on the Pacific coast
is not adequate to justify the construction of
a pipe line. It is a fortunate circumstance
that there happen to be adjacent to Vancouver, Westminster and the other cities of
the lower mainland of British Columbia,
some American cities of considerable size
that are not now being supplied with gas.
With the added advantage of supplying gas
to these cities, it is possible to support, from
a financial standpoint, a pipe line from
Alberta to the western coast of British
Columbia.
The proposed construction is a tremendous
one. I am not qualified to give an exact
statement on cost, but I have seen estimates
of $75,000 a mile and $100,000 a mile. I
think we may assume that the cost of constructing this pipe line will be somewhere
between $75 million and $100 to $125 million.
Honourable senators will see that the amount
involved is about one-third of the cost of

OCTOBER 4, 1949
constructing the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
A great project of this kind is almost comparable in importance to the construction
of the national railways in the earlier period
of our history; it therefore throws on the
Senate a great responsibility to make sure
that the right action is taken.
My honourable friend said that this bill
was before the house last year and was
passed unanimously. The natural inference
from what he said is that there is no reason
why it should not go through this house the
same way this session. Well, honourable
senators, I do not want to present an argument on that point now, but I do wish to
draw your attention that there is room for
only one pipe line.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend
from Cariboo, and all other honourable senators who have a full appreciation of the facts,
know that the traffic will support only one
pipe line.
Since last session, and as a result of action
by parliament, one company-the West Coast
Transmission Company-has gone into this
field. As I am partly instructed, and as will
be revealed in the committee, there has been
very active enterprise carried on by that
company to the end of having a pipe line
constructed under its auspices.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has the company started
construction?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No. No company is in a
position to start construction. I want to keep
away from too much controversy on this
point, but I wish to bring out some of the
problems which are involved in this proposed
legislation.
There is a fundamental difference between
the production of oil and the production of
gas. The basic distinction is that a company
may go into any section of Alberta or Northern British Columbia and drill for and get
oil. May I just interject that the government
of British Columbia is very much interested
in the activities of this company, and the
attorney-general of that province, when
appearing before the Transport Board
recently, presented a strong statement of its
views on the whole subject. As soon as oil
is struck there is a ready market for it; no
pipe line is necessary, because there are
various ways of getting the product to the
market. With gas it is a different matter;
there is no market for it without a pipe line.
There is, therefore, no inducement to develop
gas wells, or to conserve gas, until there is
definite prospect of the construction of a pipe
line.
I had occasion to say before the Transport
Board that there was more or less of a vicious
45785-7j

circle. I am told, and I think my honourable
friend from Cariboo will agree with me, that
it is easy to finance a pipeline provided, first,
you have your proved certified areas of gas;
second, you have a definite market available
for that gas; third, a clearance from all the
government bodies that control the gas that
you can use it in the way desired. This is
where the vicious circle comes in. You must
have each of these conditions provided for
before you get any of the others. I told the
board that the situation reminded me of a
story I heard about a statute which was
passed in one of the western states many
years ago. It provided that "where two
trains approach an intersection, both shall
stop, and neither shall start until the other
has passed". Honourable senators can figure
that out!
The roundabout answer I have given my
honourable friend from Waterloo amounts to
this. It will be necessary to obtain several
millions of dollars for the drilling of gas wells.
But such money will not be invested in the
development of gas as distinguished from oil
-by the drilling of gas wells in a proved area
until you have very definite indications that
a pipeline will be put through. On the other
hand, you cannot be assured of the money for
a pipeline until the other complications are
out of the road. So far as I know there is no
company-my honourable friend's, if it is
incorporated, or the one which bas already
been incorporatedHon. Mr. Euler. Which started first?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Which started first? Well,
the West Coast Transmission Company has
had nearly a year's start.
I think the issue I have presented will need
to be considered. I am not asking honourable
senators to come to any conclusions here. All
I am trying to do is to put the issues before
the minds of those who will have to consider
them. One of those issues is that there is
room for only one pipeline. Serious complications may result if you draw into the field
too many competing companies: it may head
off the financiers. That is one of the things
the committee will have to seriously investigate. The committee will have to determine
whether the company which is in the field
bas been going ahead with the preliminaries
in a rational way, up to a certain stage, with
prospects of future success. If it has, all
right.
Now, regarding the company which my
honourable friend is seeking to incorporate,
what are its prospects? Mark you, honourable senators, besides this company there is
a third company on the docket. It has not
progressed as far as the others; it has not yet
got quite to the crossing; but a petition bas

SENATE
been presented under the name, "The Prairie
Pipelines." I understand that the bill will be
sponsored by my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell).

Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, last session. So much
has happened since last session that one
almost unconsciously refers to it as last year.
But it was last session.

Hon. Mr. Euler: There are no prairies in
British Columbia, are there?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is a year off my life,
anyway!

Hon. Mr. Farris: No, but what there is on
the prairies goes out to British Columbiaincluding sometimes its cold weather.
I understand that the route specified in the
bill proposed by the honourable senator from
Toronto is identical with that in the bill
before us. So we have three competing interests. What is going to happen? Two of them
will be unsuccessful.

Hon. Mr. Farris: The consideration therefore arises, what the effect may be on the
financial activities of any company now in
the field if parliament-not merely the Secretary of State, but parliament-says "We are
going to throw two more companies in the
field and let them scrap it out." It may be
that that is the wise thing to do. I have no
definite suggestion to make about that at this
time.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What would happen if
the Board of Transport Commissioners should
refuse to grant the permit?

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Are they gas companies?
Hon. Mr. Farris: All gas companies, yes.
Two of them cannot survive, and it is quite
possible that, in the melée which will follow,
none of them will survive.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Do the bills themselves
specify the route?
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is specified in the bill
to be brought in by my honourable friend the
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell).
The Alberta Natural Gas Company or group
have already been before the Dinning Commission in Alberta and the Federal Power
Commission in the United States. My information is that in both instances they have
indicated a route almost identical with that
proposed by the so-called Prairie Pipeline
Company, though there are some variations.
I believe indications to that effect were given
last year, although I was not here when the
matter came up.
These are questions which the Chairman of
the Committee on Transport, who sits in front
of me (Hon. Mr. Copp) and the members of
his committee will have to consider. I am
told that the case is no different than if one
went to the Secretary of State and in routine
fashion under the Companies Act obtained a
charter; but from the standpoint of the men
in New York from whom the money has to be
obtained, the situation is very different, in
face of the fact that last year one company
alone was given a mandate-it is immaterial
for what reasons-and the others were not.
The fact that the company which was incorporated-has spent its money legitimately does
not necessarily vest it with any rights unless
the enterprise is in the interests of the
country. That is the only point that can, in the
nature of things, be considered.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I notice that on a couple
of occasions the honourable senator, unintentionally, said "last year". It was last session,
not last year.

Hon. Mr. Farris: That is another question
which comes up-the granting of permits.
The Board of Transport Commissioners is
meeting again on December 12. It is quite
possible that it might not grant a permit to
any one company to construct a pipe line.
I think this may be said without any qualification, that if the company which is now
applying does not get a permit, there is not
a chance in the world that any other company of that kind can get it; because Mr.
Maynard, Attorney General of Alberta,
attended the meeting of the Board of Transport Commissioners and, as far as the
southern area of Alberta was concernedwhich is the area from which, I understand
my honourable friend's company proposes to
take its gas-he made a very definite statement as to the policy of his government.
Honourable senators will recall that at a
special session of the Alberta legislature held
last July an Act was passed giving quite
drastic powers to the government of the
province and to the Petroleum and Natural
Gas Conservation Board, which is more or
less controlled by the government, in connection with the export from the province of
gas either to another province or to the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could the honourable
senator say whether any approach has been
made to any one or more of the states to
which this gas is supposed to be transported,
or whether the company have been given a
charter or some form of authorization?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not know that they
have, but that will come in due course. I am
told that the matter of obtaining a licence to
take a natural commodity out of the province
is largely routine, and that it is not difficult to
obtain the licence.

OCTOBER 4, 1949
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understand that, but does
not the state itself have to give authority for
the placing of the line within its boundaries?
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is sa. You must get
permission ta build a highway or anything
else; but I do not think that any serious
difficulty is anticipated in that connection
when it is proposed to give light, heat and
power ta the citizens of that state.
In answer to my honourable friend from
Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), as far as
any company getting a permit at this time
is concerned, the declared policy of the
Board of Transport Commissioners is not
to give a permit to construct unless and
until the province of Alberta has signified
its approval and willingness to grant a permit
to export gas from that province. There is
no question of the jurisdiction of the province.
It has the same jurisdiction that I would
have as a private individual if I owned
property in Alberta. For instance, I could
say to anybody who intended to purchase
the hay off my farm, "I shall sell hay ta you
if you will not take it outside the county".
If I made a bargain of that kind it would, of
course, be a good bargain. Alberta, either
by bargaining or by legislation, has the same
jurisdiction as an individual in regard ta an
asset. In recent years in cases of leases
granted in areas where gas has been found
in large amounts, provisions have been made
ta the effect that a lessee cannot export gas
unless the province gives its sanction. If the
province has alienated the gas rights, it
cannot impose restrictions on the export of
gas, because such restriction would not be
a matter of the exercise of property rights,
but restriction on the right of trade and
commerce. Honourable senators who are
lawyers will recall that British Columbia
once tried ta make such a restriction. It was
in the well-known case of McDonald v.
Murphy. The government of British Columbia tried ta stop the export of timber which
was owned by private citizens. It was found
that the province did not have the jurisdiction, although the judgment of the Privy
Council inferred that the province did have
jurisdiction in regard ta its own property.
But ta return ta the question asked by my
honourable friend from Provencher: Mr.
Maynard stated that the oil in the Turner
Valley area, which is supplying Calgary, was
being rapidly- depleted and that inside ten
years the supply would be exhausted. Therefore, he said, the primary policy of the
government of Alberta was ta preserve the
natural gas in Southern Alberta for Calgary,
Medicine Hat and the other communities in
that part of the province. Secondly, be said,
the policy would be ta encourage and permit
the export of gas ta Winnipeg and other

Canadian centres east of Alberta. If the
honourable senators will read the transcript
of what Mr. Maynard said, they will arrive
at the conclusion, as I have, that it is plain
that there is no chance whatever of the
Alberta Natural Gas Company or any other
company obtaining in the immediate future
a permit ta export gas from Southern Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask a question?
What the honourable senator is telling us is
extremely interesting, but the difficulty I
have in following him is that the bill now
before us does not give any indication of
where this line is ta be laid. Is parliament
or is our Transport Committee ta deal with
the matter on the theory that this line is going
ta be constructed ta British Columbia? That
is not what the bill states. I would have
thought that in the case of a conflict between
two or three companies wanting ta build in
the same area, the question would be one
for the Transport Board. Parliament is not
called upon ta deal with it. All we are asked
ta do here is ta sanction a bill allowing a
company ta build a pipe line within or
without Canada.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would point out ta my
honourable friend that parliament should not
shut its eyes ta realities, and the realities
will appear before the committee. I am
merely indicating from my information what
I believe the facts ta be. I know that the bill
of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) specifically describes a line
in Southern Alberta from Blairmore through
the Kootenays ta Kingsgate, and into the
United States and westward ta the Pacific
Coast. There is no doubt about that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, but I am referring
ta this bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: This bill bas not been
that specific. I think what I have said is
a reasonable prediction of what the company
would say, if it becomes such, or what the
promoters would say if at this stage they
should be required ta indicate ta the Transport Committee what it is they propose ta
do when they get this charter. It is not just
something they have no plans about. If it
is, why should it be left up in the air as a
menace ta companies? If, on the other hand,
they have same definite proposals, they should
be stated. Then it would come back ta the
Senate and honourable senators would know
exactly what is going on.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend is quite right there. I was just wondering whether the bills we passed last year
specifically stated the particular area in
which the companies intended ta build.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not think so.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think in the future
that parliament should take care to see that
this is done.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Correct me if I am
wrong. I think the general Act requires that
plans for the particular course of the pipe
line must be approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is true, but that does
not come in until after the permit to construct
has been granted. The train has got to be
allowed to start before it can reach the intersection. One of the facts to be kept in mind
by honourable senators is that the development of gas is the basis for the construction
of a gas pipe line, and is quite a different
problem from that of the development of oil.
You can get untold hundreds of millions of
dollars invested in drilling for oil, regardless
of whether you have a pipe line or not. But
you cannot get companies to drill for gas
unless there is some assurance of a market,
and you cannot develop any market until you
know you are going to be able to obtain a pipe
line.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the use of issuing
charters to any of these three companies if
it is the policy of the government of Alberta
not to permit the exportation of gas?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am glad that my honourable friend has asked that question, because
it shows that I have not been lucid in my
statement. The government of Alberta may
change its mind at a later date with regard
to the exportation of gas from the southern
area. But as to the area north of Edmonton,
Mr. Maynard said that there are no cities or
large centers there, and the government
would only expect a company to supply
domestic needs along the route of its pipe
line. He also said that the engineers who
had interviewed the government, including
the engineers for the line that was incorporated last year to run from the vicinity of
Calgary to Winnipeg, did not think it was
feasible to take gas from north of Edmonton
into the Winnipeg area. Mr. Maynard also
said, in effect, that while his government was
not prepared at this time to commit itself to
anything definite, it was not opposing the
application of the Westcoast Transmission
Company to the Board of Transport Conmissioners for a permit to construct a line
from the northern area of Alberta. It is the
opinion of the government of Alberta and
of the government of British Columbia that
the logical outlet for gas from northern
Alberta and northern British Columbia is
the west coast of British Columbia and the
adjacent American cities. The object of the
Westcoast Transmission Company is to fulfil
this purpose.

My honourable friend from Cariboo has
read the statement made by Mr. Wismer,
Attorney General of British Columbia, who
stated, without any qualification, that his
government stood strongly in favour of a
line from the northern parts of Alberta and
British Columbia. He gave this reason. He
said you cannot get the northern country
developed unless you have a pipe line, and
if you ever have a pipe line running from
southern Alberta into the coastal cities there
will not be a chance of obtaining a second
pipe line from the north, with the result that
that north country will never be developed.
Mr. Wismer, Mr. Maynard and others should
be asked to appear before our committee,
unless the committee would be satisfied with
a transcript of what they said before the
Board of Transport Commissioners.
So far as the northern area is concerned,
I am told-and again I am speaking only
from information-that Dr. Hume the Dominion Geologist, and other geologists will, if
called before the committee, state their
unqualified opinion that in that north
country there are unlimited known areasI mean known in the geological sense, not in
the financial sense that would enable anyone
to get money on the barrel-head-containing
trillions of cubic feet of gas. If that opinion
is expressed before the committee the suggestion will be made, as it was made before
the Transport Board, that men who are interested in the development of gas in the
northern areas of Alberta and British Columbia are prepared to put up some millions
of dollars in proving up the northern areas,
provided they have an assurance of a pipe
line. But the situation would be quite different if parliament were to permit the incorporation of other companies which may or
may not be able to get pipe lines from the
south-and whether they will be able to get
them is one of the things that the committee
will have to investigate.
In the light of all the information obtainable it will be for honourable senators to
decide whether it is in the public interest to
give some protection to the one company
which is interested in that northern section
and which, if given some protection, is prepared to spend large sums of money in
proving the area.
My honourable friend from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon), and I had a discussion about
this matter and I told him I expected to speak
on his motion for about five minutes. However, one can become long-winded in the
Senate as well as in the courts, and I am
afraid that those honourable members who
have asked questions will have to share part
of the blame for the lengthy statement I have

OCTOBER 4, 1949
made. I am glad to have had the opportunity to state my views, but I did not intend
to say so much, for I do not wish to appear
in the role of an advocate or as urging that
any particular action be taken. I understand
the general desire is to have the bill sent to
our committee on Transportation and Communications as soon as possible, in order that
we may all have a full opportunity to get to
the bottom of this question. That is certainly
my desire, for I believe every senator will
agree with me that this is one of the most
important measures that will come before us
this session.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I agree with the suggestion that the bill
should be referred to committee, but I am
not sure that I agree with my honourable
friend's arguments on Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules. I think that when we give a
bill second readingHon. Mr. Euler: That signifies approval of
the principle.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. We can protect ourselves by saying that we are not approving
the principle at all but are giving second
reading only in order to have the bill considered in committee, and reserve the right
to vote against the bill on the motion to adopt
the report of the committee or on the motion
for third reading.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It comes to practically the
same thing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but I have expressed
my understanding of the rule as we have followed it during the time that I have been a
member of the Senate.
My province is interested in this bill, and
especially my city of Winnipeg. The senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was sponsor
of a bill that was passed last session, and
I am as interested as is the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) in getting the
facts.
I want to point out one thing that has not
been mentioned so far. Alberta bas very
great natural resources in oil and gas, and we
should be very careful in dealing with these,
because a large part of the money for the
major developments must come from the
United States. This business is one in which
there will be invested, not merely a few
thousand or million dollars, but hundreds of
millions. An oil pipe line is now being built
from Alberta through Saskatchewan, through

Manitoba, down through Gretna, on to Lake
Superior, and then by barges over to Sault
Ste. Marie.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is for oil.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, as I said. My point is
that we must be careful in dealing with these
matters, so as not to have too many wild-cat
companies. I use that expression without any
offence to my honourable friend from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon). Such companies would
seriously damage the reputation of our
western oil fields as good risks for investment. Sorne honourable members within my
hearing have suggested that the Board of
Transport Commissioners will be able to
exercise sufficient control over the companies,
but in my opinion that we, as members of
parliament, have a responsibility not to incorporate companies for dealing with these
tremendous resources unless we provide
every reasonable safeguard for the investor,
so that if he does not become rich through
the purchase of shares in the companies, he
will at least get a run for his money. As the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) said a few days ago-whether
in private conversation or on the floor of the
house, I do not remember-our immense
resources of oil and gas in that country could
attract millions of American dollars, which
we so sorely need. When the bill is in committee I am going to stress the point that we
must be careful not to incorporate too many
companies.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

WORLD SERIES
RADIO BROADCASTS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
should like to draw the attention of the
honourable leader of the government to the
fact that the World Series baseball games are
now in progress, and that they are being
broadcast over the air each afternoon. Many
of us who follow these games throughout the
season would like to hear these broadcasts,
and I would therefore suggest that future
sittings of the Senate be called for 4 o'clock
in the afternoon instead of 3 o'clock. We
would be glad to sit an hour later, in order
to make that arrangement possible.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are the games over by
4 o'clock?
Hon. Mr. Leger: Let us amend the rules.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The best I can say in
answer to my friend is that I will take the
matter under consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That means it is a dead
issue.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Godbout for an
Address in reply thereto.

OCTOBER 5, 1949
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
the older members of this chamber will not
be surprised to see me rise to take part in
this debate, but I am sure the newer members will wonder why I do not leave the
speech-making to those who are better able
to do it than I am.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are none.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I wish, first, to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment as presiding officer in this chamber.
I regret that the mover of the Address (Hon.
Mr. Godbout) is not present, for I wish to
compliment him on his remarks. I may say
that I have known his brother in western
Canada for some thirty years. To the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Petten), who comes frorn Newfoundland, and to the other senators from
that province, I may say that in my humble
way I am pleased to extend to you a welcome
to the Senate of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I add that our little
group on this side of the house is looking
forward to an addition of three members from
your fine province? I hope justice will be
meted out to us in this way. It was intended
by the founders of our confederation that
each party should have proper representation in this house; therefore I look forward to
the appointment of three members from your
province to this side of the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I hope you will not be
disappointed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I might well have foregone the opportunity of speaking in this
debate but for the fact that our honourable
leader never holds a caucus. When he
expressed himself as being in favour of
abolishing appeals to the Privy Council, he
said he spoke for his party in this house. Had
he held a caucus, he would have known that
I for one do not share all of his views. The
point has been quite well covered by the
honourable lady senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) with, as the legal men say,
"a proper clincher."
Perhaps I am different from some honourable senators, but I think I represent a crosssection of the people of Western Canada.
When the government says that the time has
come to abolish the right of appeal to the
Privy Council, I disagree. In all my lifetime
it never occurred to me that my right to
appeal to a tribunal outside Canada in any
way interfered with our position as a nation,
or that it made us more colonial. The honourable senator from Peterborough pointed, as
an example, to the ridiculous decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada on the question of
whether or not a woman is "a person".
45785-8

I should like at this time to refer to the
late Nellie McClung, and to mention the
privilege I had of hearing her speak. It
was many years ago, when I was in my teens
and used to ship horses west. It took some
fourteen to sixteen days to make the trip,
and as horses were very valuable I used
to watch them fairly closely. At Winnipeg
I decided to go on to Dauphin and spend
the night. When I arrived there someone
said "You had better go and hear Nellie
McClung: she is giving a reading." So I
went, and never in all my life have I enjoyed
an evening more. I thought then, and I
think now, what a pity that a woman of her
calibre had not the opportunity of becoming
a member of either house of this parliament.
The story she told, the reading she gave
remains imprinted on my mind to this day.
I thought it was a grand story. I may add
that at the time I was a bachelor. The tale
was about some folks who moved to Calgary
and became wealthy. Later the grandmother
joined them. She, wanted to do a certain
amount of work around the house, but that
could not be allowed, for they were rich and
they had to have a maid. So the grandmother, being unable to content herself in
idleness, answered an advertisement for a
housekeeper for a homesteader. Mrs. McClung depicted the incident so vividly that
I could almost see the station, the road, and
the shack of the bachelor, with his trunkful
of dirty shirts and collars, and how the old
lady went to the bottom of everything and
straightened up the place. The happy ending
was that a granddaughter came along eventually and married the bachelor farmer. Such
was the ability of that great woman Nellie
McClung, that I still remember practically
the entire story.
But there are other reasons why I am
concerned about this legislation. One is
expressed in the following extract from the
Telegraph-Journal of Saint John, New
Brunswick:
Citizens of New Brunswick and other Maritime
Provinces have long cherished the opportunity to
appeal to Britain's Privy Council. They have felt
it was one of their surest constitutional safeguards
against the possibility that the larger and wealthier
provinces, or the nation as a whole, might ride
roughshod over the rights they enjoy as equal partners in the Confederation agreement.
Thinking people in these seaside provinces have
been a little uneasy over the new moves to elimmate the "badge of colonialism" from Canada. The
way they look at it is that they have very little if
anything to gain, and possibly much to lose.

Though I come frorn Western Canada,
honourable senators, that is my view. I
cannot see that we have anything to gain,
and possibly we have very much to lose.
Let us imagine one or two possibilities. I
am sure all honourable senators remember
that the leader of this side was brought to

SENATE
task for expressing any doubt that the British
Government would fully live up to their
agreement with us; it was declared that
although they were getting our wheat for
as much as 70 or 80 cents less than the world
price, they would make a cash adjustment;
and doubters on this side were told that they
were doubting the word of England. Now,
because of price limitations and other reasons
we have lost nearly a billion dollars. Suppose
the wheat growers decided to go to court
for a settlement. I am not to be understood
as criticizing the decision to help England;
what I am objecting to is that Western
Canada has had to carry the whole burden.
But suppose we were to take the matter to
court with a view of securing some adjustment to be borne by Canada as a whole,
what might we expect from a Supreme Court
consisting for the most part of judges from
the provinces which have received particular
benefits from the cheap wheat and flour
supplied by Western Canada, the provinces
where large population centres have benefited
from the low prices established for Western
Canada's one vital commodity? Further, I
would draw attention to the increased freight
rates in Western Canada. Not having the
competitive water rates to be found in
Eastern Canada, what will be left for the
western provinces if the price of grain is
lowered? The minister in another place said
recently that he did not think the government could interfere with the Board of
Transport Commissioners. I have had some
experience in these matters and I do not
agree with that statement. The Board of
Transport Commissioners is merely something
to which the government can "pass the buck";
and it is my firm belief that it did exactly
as the government wanted it to do in this
case, and the result has fallen most heavily
on Western Canada.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I would suggest that the honourable
member from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
had no intention of making offensive remarks
with respect to the board of which he was
speaking at the time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, at any rate that is
my opinion from my experience with that
board.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I must again rise to a point
of order. I believe that the last words of the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake would
tend to refute the assumption of His Honour
the Speaker that the member did not intend
to make disparaging remarks about the
Board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I, too, rise to a point of
order. I do not intend to allow the remarks
of my honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) to get by. Anyone can speak
in this house on a judgment already given
by the board. If that cannot be donc, when
will we ever get anywhere in this house? My
honourable friend from Blaine Lake was not
speaking disparagingly of the Board. He was
speaking of the judgment that was delivered
by it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I again rise to a point of
order. The honourable senator from Blaine
Lake did not discuss the judgment at all; he
referred to the Board of Transport Commissioners as something to which the government and railways were "passing the buck".
The Hon. the Speaker: The points of order
raised on both sides have not tended to settle anything, and I would ask the honourable
member to continue his speech with due
regard to the respect to which the Board is

could have had it if you wanted it." Similarly, I suppose it can be said that the
facilities were at Port Arthur and we could
have had them if we wanted them.
I candidly think that ships equipped with
radar and other modern devices could use the
Hudson Bay route for not merely two months
every year, but ten months. The straits are
possibly freer of ice in winter than in the
summer, and if some of the money spent on
dredging the St. Lawrence were used to
improve the Hudson Bay route, the insurance
rate would possibly be as low on shipments
from Hudson Bay as via the St. Lawrence.
This matter is of tremendous importance,
especially now that the railways have
increased their freight rates. The Hudson
Bay route is, I claim, another case in which
a province small in population and weak in
political influence has not received justice at
the hands of the country generally.
I would also like to remind the government that a number of people in our province wish to import some livestock from the
Old Country. As the stockyards that were
at Churchill have been demolished, we think
that the Pas, where there are yards available
for testing imported cattle, should be made
a quarantine base. There is plenty of feed
available for this purpose at the Pas.
Now I wish to refer to one or two matters
dealt with by the senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I love
to listen to both of them, and only wish I
could express myself in as able a manner.
But the honourable gentleman from Inkerman is much tainted with socialism, and the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
-well, much as I enjoy his speeches, I can
hardly place him. He is sometimes a Conservative, tainted with communism and
socialism. A year ago, when speaking of all
the regulations that we still have in force, he
said that Canada cannot exist half bound and
half free. That is exactly my view.
I remember that some years ago the honourable gentleman from Inkerman was in
close touch with and a great admirer of Dr.
Marsh, who I believe used to be Professor of
Economics at McGill University. Dr. Marsh
was once present for two hours at a Senate
committee, and I thought he was the very
man who could answer a question that I put
to him. He did give me an answer, but I
could not understand it, and in fact I doubt
whether he was capable of answering the
question. When the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman was such a strong admirer
of Professor Marsh I do not think he knew
that the professor was the author of the
C.C.F. handbook. The fact is, though, that
the professor drew up a socialist plan for
45785-Si

Canada, and part of it was adopted by the
Liberal government. The honourable senator
quoted some lines from Oliver Goldsmith. I
wish to add to the quotation:
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade;
A breath can make them, as a breath has made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.

I hold in my hand a pamphlet sent to me,
as no doubt to all other senators, from the
Dairy Council of Canada. If the senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has not already
read it, I would suggest that he read it over
twice.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I saw it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will quote a short
part of it:
There are nearly four hundred thousand farms
in Canada where milk is produced, in large and
small quantities.
Remember each farmer has a
family, often one or more hired hands who also
have families. There are more than four thousand
plants across Canada where milk is handled or
processed, ranging al the way from the cross-roads
cheese factory, employing one or two men, to great
city plants where hundreds work. Then there are
the many industrial plants where supplies, boxes,
bottles, and cartons, intricate machinery and equipment for the whole industry, and hundreds of other
required products are made.
There are the
thousands of men who distribute dairy products at
the wholesale and retail level, those who work in
almost every store selling these products, those
who make trucks and work on the railroads and
ships.
Add it all up, and you have a large segment of
our population engaged directly or indirectly in
the dairy industry.

These are the four hundred thousand people
-the
"bold peasantry," if you like-who
are going to be destroyed if we continue to
allow the manufacture and importation of
margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You do not believe that?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I do believe it. And
may I tell the senator from Waterloo that
the sale of margarine has resulted already
in the disposal of perhaps one hundred dairy
herds in this country. Faced with competition
from margarine, many dairy farmers have
lost hope for the future.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You said that the manufacture and importation of margarine would
destroy four hundred thousand farmers. That
is nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It will certainly lower
their standard of living. And those people,
as I have pointed out before, never received
wages. They operated what might be called
family factories, and often the children
worked in bare feet. I can remember going
for the cows when white frost was on the
field, and to warm my toes I was glad to stand
on the places where cows had lain in the
night.

SENATE
The way in which the margarine question
was dealt with is one of the reasons why
I am as strongly opposed as I can be to
abolition of appeals to the privy council.
As I have previously said, I never felt that
Canadians were in any inferior position
because they could appeal to the privy council from decisions of the Supreme Court of
Canada. I realize that I am only a layman,
but I make bold to express my views on
this question.
I am greatly amused when my honourable
friend frorn Toronto-Trinity and other senators talk about their Liberal free trade.
After all, you cannot make water run up
hill, and no political party would dare continue for any length of time a policy that
would ruin this country. The honourable
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) said we
have to be careful in dealing with some
industries. I will tell you what happens.
When the tariff is lowered the price of the
imported article is raised, so that the cost
to the consumer is the same as before. As
a Conservative, I am in favour of free trade
and quite prepared to have it put into effect
as widely as possible. But let me read something that the Calgary Herald said:
Under the title "The Basic Fallacy of
Liberalism":
Rt. Hon. C. D. Howe remarked in Ottawa last
week that the Canadian government had pegged the
Canadian dollar at a 10-cent discount, rather than
allowing it to move freely and find its own value,
because "no country dares to have a free currencyfree for every speculator to shoot at."
Our correspondent, John Bird, comments that
Mr. Howe made this remark "sadly."
He should
have made it shamefacedly, for it is frankly untrue.
The United States dollar is not pegged or controlled; neither is the Swiss franc; neither, since
last Tuesday, is the French franc.
Now Mr. Howe and his colleagues in the Cabinet
may argue that the U.S. can afford to allow the
American dollar to be bought and sold freely, without restriction of any kind, because the U.S. is in
such a commanding economic position. But we do
not sec how he can argue that the Swiss economy,
much less the French economy, is so much stronger
than the Canadian economy that Switzerland or
France can afford to have a free currency while
Canada cannot.
The government evidently fears that if the Canadian dollar were set free, all of the $1,000,000,000
which the Bank of Canada now holds in its reserves
of gold and American dollars would promptly flee
from Ottawa, to take refuge either in Washington
or at Fort Knox, Ky. We believe this to be arrant
nonsense; next to the United States itself, Canada
is in a stronger economic position than any other
nation in the world, and if the federal government
has so little faith in this country's future that it is
afraid to let the Canadian dollar stand on its own
feet, then it is scarcely worth the name of government at all.
It has set a new arbitrary value on the Canadian
dollar, declaring it to be worth exactly 90 cents
instead of 100.
AIl the controls and irritating
regulations governing the spending of Canadian
dollars outside Canada remain; the only effect of
devaluation has been to make American imports

10 per cent dearer and to allow American tourists
to get $1.10 for every American dollar they bring
here.
We hoped that Mr. Abbott would promise that
devaluation would permit a gradual relaxation of
controls, but he has made no such promise. Indeed,
to judge from the remarks of Mr. Howe, the government isn't sure that devaluation will have any
real effect at ail.
The truth of the matter is that the Liberal party,
belying the great name and the great tradition to
which it is heir, is afraid of a free market. Its long
years of power have made it so arrogant that it
believes that the predictions and estimates, the
graphs and charts and tables of a few experts on
Parliament Hill, can produce more wisdom than
the composite actions of free men going about their
business and making millions of separate calculations every day. This is the basic fallacy of Socialism, and in Canada it is the basic fallacy of Liberalism as well.

That article expresses my views very well.
This idea of regulating and planning is simply copying the policies of the C.C.F., and of
the Communists. I may say to my honourable friends, if it is any comfort to them,
that during the recent election many candidates were elected by the Communist vote.
So the Liberals must be satisfying that group.
A recent article in the Ottawa Journal
attempts to show how the C.C.F. party would
plan the whole world. I say the policy of
the present government is the way to accomplish the same result.
The honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) complained in
his speech that the taxation on land in the
Old Country was not sufficiently high. I see
by the press that some of the landowners of
that country have had to set up little stalls
by the roadside and sell vegetables in order
to gain a livelihood. That situation reminds
me of the story of the man who believed in
socialism, and asked an Irish hog producer

to give him one of his pigs because he had
none. There are certain classes of people
who choose to make their money without
owning land, and they always want the landowner to pay more taxes. For my part, I
believe the best citizen is the fellow who
owns a little piece of the earth. We in the
province of Saskatchewan are having a taste
of this taxation problem. In England they
adopt harsher methods. Beverley Baxter
said, in an article recently published in
Maclean's magazine, that when the landowners refuse to co-operate with the socialists' request to give up their properties they
will be regarded as beasts, and anyone who
shoots one of them is not liable to be punished. That is the ultimate in socialism.
The honourable member from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. BurchilD twitted me rather
good naturedly concerning the prospects of
gain in Western Canada by the party to
which I belong. I am sorry my friend is not
in the chamber at the moment, because I

OCTOBER 5, 1949
intend to answer him in my own way. Evidently the Toronto Star had somewhat the
same fears as my friend had concerning the
western vote. As almost everyone knows, the
Toronto Star is the most rabid Liberal paper
in Canada. Apparently it suffered some fears
because of my remarks in this house last
session. Someone sent me a clipping of an
article from that paper which undertook to
deal with me and to offset any influence
I might have. The Star pointed out that I
had been defeated twice in my attempt to
gain a seat in the Saskatchewan legislature.
May I tell that paper of the propaganda used
by the Liberal party at that time-I hope
it is proud of it. The slogan was: "A vote
for Horner is a vote for conscription and a
vote for war". This slogan served to upset
badly the minds of the people in that area.
For instance, a big man weighing about 260
pounds, but unable to read English, went into
the polling booth, and by mistake he voted
for me. When he came out of the booth he
asked where the names were on the ballot,
and when he learned that he had voted for
me he stood up against the schoolhouse wall
and the tears flowed down his face; he broke
down completely and prayed to his Saviour
to forgive him for voting for a man who
would make war. In its article the Star
chose not to mention the fact that I was for
four years reeve of the municipality in which
I lived, consisting of nine townships. I was
a young man in those days, and I was faced
with a propaganda campaign of the kind
Evidently the forces
I have mentidned.
opposed to me feared that I might get into
public life. Those elections in Saskatchewan
remind me of the recent article appearing in
the Saturday Evening Post on a play of the
late W. C. Fields, the rowdy king of comedy.
His slogan was "Never give a sucker an even
break." That is the way the people were
treated in Western Canada.
I had an amusing experience many years
ago, and as it reflects on myself, I will take
the liberty of telling it here. In the 1914
election for reeve of our municipality, which
was very keenly contested, the candidates
were Anton Krisnoyski, Alex. Vernhagin and
myself. There was one far-away poll which
I had not visited, where the poll box, when
opened, showed 35 votes for Krisnoyski, 35
votes for Vernhagin and one for Horner.
After the election was over, I met Peter
Dobellgraff, who had been the local returning
officer. I said, "Well, Pete do I have to blame
you for voting for me?" He said, "No, Mr.
Horner, I no vote for you." I said, "Then
I guess it was Pete Podoski." "No," he said,
"Pete no come to vote at all." "Then who
in the world was it?" I asked. "Oh," he said,

"it was Metro Hunchuck." "Well," I said,
"what's the matter with him?" "Oh," says
Pete, "he a little bit crazy."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: However, at the next
election for reeve that poll gave me 90 votes.
I notice in the Speech from the Throne that
housing is to be the subject of another legislative drive. My personal belief is that we
would have been better off today if governments had left housing and rent control and
everything pertaining thereto strictly alone.
Some of these housing enterprises will result
in huge losses to the taxpayers of this country.
Houses constructed with government guarantees and financial assistance are even now
falling apart: many of them were built with
green lumber and, I think, will be a dead loss.
While upon the subject of housing, I feel
that as a duty and, indeed, as a kindness to
the government, I should make some allusion
to the proposal to spend a quarter of a million
dollars upon a home for the Prime Minister.
I am very much opposed to it. As to the
argument that the people favour the idea,
I might point out that you can get people to
sign petitions for anything.
I may be
regarded in Ottawa as a "bad boy", but my
motive is a kindly one. I invite those of you
who have raised families to reflect on the
position in which you are asked to place the
Prime Minister and his good lady. Since when
has a Prime Minister of Canada been expected
to do entertaining, and what time will he have
for it? Suppose you hire twenty servants to
staff this house, who will have to supervise
them but the lady who, having raised her
family, is entitled to enjoy a quiet time in her
home. To me the project is simply ridiculous.
The parallel which has been suggested in
another place between our Prime Minister
and the occupant of the White House is not
parallel at all. The two cases are entirely
different. We have a Government House. As
all honourable senators know who have been
here any length of time, Government House
is a pleasant and lively place where we can
meet and get acquainted, and where the
Prime Minister himself can be entertained
and meet ambassadors and other important
officials. I say that the Prime Minister of this
great country has not the time to undertake
large-scale entertaining.
On this point
although the present Prime Minister's predecessor held office longer than any other
Prime Minister in the British Empire, I never
heard of him entertaining anybody-and he
is living in a house which the people of
Canada had understood was to be the home
of Liberal Prime Ministers. However, that
is by the way. I would warn the Liberal
party in a friendly spirit that if they persist

SENATE
in this proposal it will arouse a great commotion among people who need houses, and
who will point out that, for the amount of
money proposed to be spent on this project,
a hundred ordinary houses could be built.
I advise the government to go very slowly.
I always enjoy the speeches of the honourable senator from Medicine Hat. (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), who spoke of irrigation. I know
something about his province.
Irrigation, of course, plays an important
part in the production of food. The honourable senator from Medicine Hat did not mention the Red River scheme, one of the biggest irrigation projects in western Canada. A
large dam was built there a year ago, but
since the winter snowfall there has been no
moisture, so there is not a drop of water in
the dam.
How many senators, I wonder, have been
in the great Pace River country, north of
Edmonton? Perhaps some of you have heard
or read in the papers about the huge breaking scheme, involving 100,000 acres of virgin
soil means. I went all through that country
this summer. For miles and miles on either
side of the track, as far as one can see, that
beautiful land is empty. It could maintain, I
believe, a good part of the whole population
of Canada. It contains coal and oil and gas.
I never before realized that so large an area
of British Columbia is comprised in that
agricultural belt. At Dawson Creek there are
eight elevators, all but one having huge
annexes, each capable of holding 30,000
bushels. Grain is drawn there from distances
up to 75 miles. An outlet to the Pacific coast
for that great country is absolutely necessary.
In planning for food production and regulating supplies, let us not overlook our obligation to. allow larger numbers of people to
enter this country. I believe that such a
course will be to our great advantage.
Honourable senators know of the difficulty in
which Allied-controlled Germany is placed
through the arrival of innumerable refugees
from the Russian zone. There is no room for
them in their own country, and many of
these people would make the finest possible
settlers. But no! Supposedly there is some
obstacle. Either we are told that peace has
not been concluded, or some other objection is
made.
Well, there are no objections on my part.
r know of no surer way to avoid the inroads
of that great world calamity, communism,
than to admit to this country a million or so
of healthy displaced persons, including Germans. It makes me ashamed to be a Canadian
when I read of our attitude towards those
four hundred brave people who, evading gunboats by leaving at night because Sweden
had been ordered by Russia to return them

to that country crossed the Atlantic in a ship
which would properly accommodate no more
than fifty in the hope of finding a place in a
free world. The press says the government
may not admit them and they may be disappointed when they arrive in Halifax. As
a Canadian citizen I am ashamed that we do
not say, "You are welcome to this country".
Because of the present tangled currency
situation, I have little hope that we are going
to be able to do much exporting, and so we
shall need these people to increase our home
consumption. The United States became a
great country by allowing such people to
come within their boundaries. That nation
now bas an immense consumption, and that
is the very thing which eventually will be
Canada's salvation. We need more people to
consume, and more farms to produce. At the
present time the number of our farms is
dwindling instead of increasing, and this state
of affairs is calamitous.
Again as last year, the main boast of the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is the prosperity of our country, and the
millions of dollars in our banks. He does not
tell us, though, that our debt bas increased
to about $14 billion, and that whereas each
person's share of the national debt was $200
ten years ago, it is now $1400. It is a straight
case of each family now having a large
mortgage on its future and on its property. I
repeat that we should start to pay off this
debt and not increase it. The men who can
best afford to pay it off are those who are
drawing the interest, while the men who can
least afford it are those who are going to
have to pay it.
When the Liberals boast about the present
prosperity of the country, but the truth of the
matter is that it is a war prosperity. As a
result of the war we have manufactured
great quantities of merchandise and machinery; there bas been a market for all of our
food commodities; there has been no labour
problem. This is the prosperity we have
been enjoying. I am sure, however, that the
government does not claim to have instigated
the war; and if they did not do so how can
they take credit for the billions of dollars
that now lie in our banks?
Honourable senators, we have to face the
facts in order to save our country. In raising my objections today I have not intended
that honourable senators should think that I
wish to be unkind. I have simply done what
I feel to be my duty as a member of the
Senate, and I thank honourable senators for
their kind attention.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I rise to a point of personal privilege.

OCTOBER 5, 1949
I have listened with much interest and amusement to the remarks of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
However, he made one reference in the early
stages of his speech that I think I should ask
him to withdraw. They say sticks and stones
will break your bones, but names will never
hurt you. That, of course, is the axiom we
follow. Nevertheless, even though we in
this chamber often disagree we should be
careful about the names we use in referring
to one another. My honourable friend from
Blaine Lake, in referring to me personally,
associated me with the terms Conservative,
socialist and communist. I have no objection to the term Conservative-because I am
conservative in some respects-so long as I
am not called a Tory.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The word "socialism"
means so much in so many ways that no one
should object too much to it. However, there
are connotations of the word communist
which I feel should not be allowed to pass
without comment. Therefore, I would ask
my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) to kindly withdraw that
portion of his remark.
Hon. Mr. Horner: All right, I shall withdraw that reference. The word socialist will
do for the time being.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, like
those who have preceded me, I should like
to compliment His Honour the Speaker upon
his selection as the presiding officer of the
Senate. I am sure all of us feel that he will
perform his duties with dignity, impartiality
and efficiency. I should also like to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr. Godbout) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Petten) of the Address.
I regret exceedingly that I could not follow
the speech of the mover because, unfortunately, I do not understand the French
language. If there is one thing I regret
keenly it is that in my parliamentary experience of thirty-two years I did not make
some attempt to acquire at least a working
knowledge of the French language. I will
make the promise that if I am here for
another thirty-two years, as I feel I may be,
I shall do my best to correct that fault.
Some Hon. Senaors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like personally
to congratulate the seconder of the Address
(Hon. Mr. Petten) on his interesting and
informative speech. He said that if a referendum on the question of confederation were
taken in Newfoundland today, the vote would
show 80 per cent of the electorate was for
union. I would like to say to him- and to
the people of Newfoundland that practically

100 per cent of the Canadian people were
in favour of Newfoundland joining this
Confederation.
Some Hon. Senafors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In fact, I should like to
suggest that the members of this house make
it a point to visit Newfoundland next summer for the purpose of coming into personal
contact with the excellent people of that
province and learning at first hand something
about the wonderful resources they possess.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) made a few remarks in his speech to
which I should like to refer. He mentioned
one thing that I have already advocated in
this house, although perhaps not quite to
the same extent. He made the suggestionI suppose because there is such a preponderantly large Liberal representation here-that
the Liberals should forget that they are
Liberals. I am quite sure that it was merely
forgetfulness that he neglected to say to the
supporters who sit behind him that they
should forget they are Conservatives. I am
equally certain that if there were a big
majority behind him he would still say the
same thing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I had the honour of saying
that in 1946.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not remember that.
I would remind my honourable friend that
I have said the same thing, although perhaps
not in the same words. I have always believed
that the greatest usefulness of the Senate can
only be attained if the members of this
body exercise a spirit of independence in the
widest possible degree, and decide questions
on their merits. By that I do not mean
that the Senate has any right deliberately
to obstruct measures coming from the other
bouse. I have expressed the opinion before
that the Senate is an undemocratic body.
We are not elected, and I think that we
should not set our faces against measures
passed by the elected house, especially at
the first session after a general election.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does that include all legislative measures coming from the Commons,
or only those proposed by the government
during the election campaign?
Hon. Mr. Euler: The people of the country
elect the members of the House of Commons
for a period of four or five years, and I think
that thereby the members of that house are
given a mandate to deal with legislation
according to their convictions. I have always
said that our Senate is quite unrepresentative, and I think it would be fair to have in
this country some such provision as they
have in England for curbing the powers of
the House of Lords. I am not strongly in

SENATE
favour of aping others or of following precedents, but I do believe it might be well if
in Canada we had a provision that a measure
once-or, if preferred, twice-passed by the
Commons and rejected by the Senate would,
if passed again by the Commons, become
law, even though the Senate again rejected
it. I think that would be responsible government and democratic government. That
is my opinion, but I quite realize that some
senators will not agree with me.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would my honourable
friend allow me to interrupt? His suggestion that the Senate should endorse all
measures that have been passed on two separate occasions by the Commons seems to me
to be too sweeping. I understood that the
purpose of the Senate was to prevent the
passage of hasty legislation originating in
the chamber elected by popular vote.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To prevent the passage of
hasty legislation, yes; but I should think that
after the House of Commons has considered
and passed a bill twice, that bill should become law. We have made some very important and valuable amendments to measures
that have come before us; but the House of
Commons represents the people, and in the
final analysis should stand supreme in
parliament.
I propose to deal briefly with one or two
other subjects, but first I want to disabuse
the minds of members that I am going to
make a long speech on margarine. Of course,
I do not agree with my friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). I cannot for one
moment believe that the dairy farmers of
Canada are being ruined by margarine. As
a matter of fact, I know that a good many
are themselves buying margarine and selling
their butter, and they probably never had
larger incomes than they have received in
recent years. I certainly have no prejudice
against dairymen or any other class of
farmers, but I must admit that it is very
gratifying to me to know that because of the
Supreme Court's decision millions of Canadians-not merely four hundred thousand,
but millions-are benefitting through the use
of that excellent and comparatively inexpensive food, margarine.
I am only sorry that some of the provinces
have enacted reactionary legislation which,
though permitting the manufacture and sale
of margarine, compels the busy housewife to
colour the product in her kitchen, when it
might as well have come to her already
coloured by the manufacturer. Indeed, the
province of Quebec and Prince Edward
Island have gone so far as to prohibit entirely
the manufacture and sale of margarine. I
regret also that the Federation of Agriculture

has seen fit to appeal from the decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada to the Privy
Council. In the end the opponents of margarine must lose their fight.
Let me conclude my remarks on this subject by saying that in the very unlikely
event of the Privy Council reversing the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada and
declaring that the federal law prohibiting the
sale, manufacture and importation of margarine is constitutional, it will become my
duty to introduce a fourth bill, or as many
more as may be necessary, to repeal that
prohibitory legislation.
Now I wish to pass on to a subject of
infinitely greater importance to Canada and
the world. I desire to make a suggestion
which members may regard as highly
idealistic, and not to be expected from a
man who regards himself, and who perhaps
is regarded also by others, as being of a
practical turn of mind. But I believe the suggestion is essentially entirely realistic. My
remarks will not follow along the lines of the
excellent addresses made by the leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen). I do not pretend to say whether
the devaluation of the dollar or of the pound
was wise or otherwise, although I admit in
passing that I should be very glad if we
could soon get rid of all these controls.
I believe most members will admit that
while the measures taken by the government
may be immediately necessary they do not,
in the long view, provide a complete solution
of the problems of Canada and the western
democracies. I believe that the remedy is
and must be of a much more drastic nature.
Today we feel that our chief problem arises
from two very destructive wars, and now
particularly out of the clash of the two great
ideologies, democracy and communism.
Britain's financial difficulties are enhanced
by the necessity of spending hundreds of
millions of pounds in preparation for defence
against a possible enemy in another war.
Even in Canada, I believe, the present year's
estimates for military or defence purposes
are something like $400 million, an amount
almost as great as we spent annually for
all purposes prior to the last war, and nearly
three times our national debt before the
First Great War. It is also about three times
as much as we paid out every year for
carrying on all the public services of Canada
prior to the First Great War. Yet, costly as
they are, and probably quite necessary, these
immediate remedies give us no real hope of
relief from our difficulties during the lifetime
of any of us here.
Now it seems to me that there are really
only two possible solutions of these difficulties.

OCTOBER 5, 1949
une is a moral, religious or spiritual revival
among all the peoples of the world, with a
real appreciation of the brotherhood of man
and the need for living together in peace and
harmony. I admit that I am not optimistic
that this will occur.
The second solution is, in my opinion, complete world federation or union-or perhaps
I should say a half-world union. In the
Atlantic pact, which is a union for defence
purposes, we have a recognition of the fact
that in union is strength. Would not that
union be infinitely stronger if it were enlarged
to commercial and, yes, even political union?
Perhaps that is a vision or a dream; but in
view of the tremendous changes that have
taken place in this country and all over the
world during the last few years who will
say that that dream or vision may not by
force of circumstances become a reality?
The history of the world shows that from
the earliest days there has been a development of the spirit of union-first the family,
then the clan, then the tribe, then the principality, and finally the united nation. We
see that situation in the countries of Europe.
Italy, for instance, at one time was a mere
hodge-podge of duchies and principalities;
then-perhaps through the ambition of certain men, and the patriotic action of othersshe emerged as a united country. The same
thing took place in France, Germany and
Great Britain. At one time there were the
separate countries of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Now, except for southern
Ireland, they are one country. We have an
outstanding example in modern Russia, that
great combination of fifty or sixty republics
united in the Union of Socialist Soviet
Republics. I am speaking now of the historical trend of countries uniting, usually for
the benefit of those who unite. Perhaps the
greatest example of all is the United States
of America. These forty-eight states, all,
with a few minor exceptions, countries in
themselves, are bound together in one great
federation which has made it the greatest
country in the world. That country constantly claims that it has the highest standard
of living in the world. Well, I have been
in the southern states, and if what I saw
there was a sample of their high standard of
living, we do not want it in Canada. By and
large, taking into consideration the real
values in life, I think the Canadian standard
of living is just as high as that in the United
States.
To come down to more recent days, we
have the countries of the Cape Colony, the
Orange Free State, the Transvaal, Rhodesia
and Natal, all combining to form the great
Union of South Africa. Australia has folIowed the same plan.

Coming to the history of our present day,
we all remember that after the disaster of
Dunkirk, Winston Churchill, then Prime
Minister of Great Britain, offered a complete
union between Britain and France. It was
not accepted. The countries of Holland,
Belgium and Luxemburg have formed the
Benelux commercial union. At this very
moment meetings are taking place among
delegates of the western European democracies, with a view to forming complete
federation for purposes which those democracies think necessary in order to give them
strength.
The old proverb still stands: In union is
strength. I am tempted to say that if we do
not hang together we will hang separately.
In the early days the New England States
had a rather loose sort of federation, which
did not work out very well and the States
were bankrupt. Through some plan-I think
it was called the Alexander Hamilton plana closer union was formed, and as we know, it
later became one of the strongest federations
in the world.
Now the United States, Canada and Great
Britain, along with the other members of the
Commonwealth, might well join with France,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Western Germany and other democracies in one federation.
In such a union as I suggest I would favour
the inclusion of all democracies. Such a great
federation would be founded on the theory
that the stronger we make the democracies
the better they will be able to defend themselves against that other great ideology found
east of what is generally known as the Iron
Curtain.
We have already proceeded in this direction
by the adoption of the Atlantic Pact. Not all
of the democracies are in it, but a good many
are. If, in order to resist agression a military
union is a good thing for us, surely a commercial federation, or a union for other purposes, would make us all the more strong.
I believe that ultimately circumstances will
force us into a union of that nature. It is not
a new idea.
I think all senators receive the publication
called "Freedom & Union" and are familiar
with the fact that there is now before the
Senate of the United States a resolution along
the line of my suggestion. In fact, there are
now two resolutions before the Senate and
the House of Representatives in the United
States. Some twenty very prominent senators have sponsored the resolution before the
Senate, and the proponents of the resolution
before the House of Representatives claim to
have the support of 101 members of that
chamber.
Resolution No. 56, sponsored by Senator
Tobey and co-sponsored by 18 other senators.

SENATE

calls on Congress to make it a fundamental
objective of U.S. foreign policy to strengthen
the United Nations and seek its development
into a world federation of all nations. That
at the moment is a matter of United States
policy and does not particularly concern us.
Another resolution was moved by one of the
new members, Senator Kefauver, a Democrat
from Tennessee. I shall not read the preamble, but the resolution itself is as follows:
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the President is requested
to invite the democracies which sponsored the North
Atlantic Treaty to name delegates, representing
their principal political parties, to meet with delegates of the United States in a Federal Convention
to explore how far their peoples, and the peoples
of such other democracies as the convention may
invite to send delegates, can apply among them,
within the framework of the United Nations, the
principles of free federal union.

As I say, the thought is not a new one. It
has fairly strong support in both houses in
the United States. The resolutions probably
will not carry, but the support is strong
enough to arouse some thought and consideration on the part of the American people which
may ultimately result in what Senator
Kefauver-and I, in all modesty-believe will
come to pass.

I regret that I have not the eloquence to
place this subject properly before this chamber. Perhaps the senators will pardon me if
I read some extracts which present my
thoughts in better form than I could express
them. A paragraph on the attitude of Senator
Hill reads as follows:
Senator Hill saw the need to deal with broader

He
problems than just the military.
"I think I can say that we all feel that the actions

in the past
or lasting peace. Some other action must be taken.
The Atlantic Union Resolution is a step toward
bringing together the peace-loving and democratie
nations for our peace and for the peace of the
world. We cannot deal only with military problems.
We must also attack the basic economie problems
which are the causes of war. This resolution suggests a method of accomplishing this.

This is from Senator Kefauver himself;
The fact is that we Americans face in the North
Atlantic area with Canada, Britain, France and
Benelux, not one problem but a complex of probmonetary,
military,
political,
lems-economie,
atomic, and, I would add, moral and spiritual. We
have been trying to solve these problems separately, piecemeal, by the European Recovery Program on the economie side, and when that proved
insufficient, by the North Atlantic Treaty on the
political side; and already we are asked to supplement this with a rearmament program on the military side. Meanwhile a new monetary make-shift
is looming ahead, and there are whispers of a new
atomic enigma to be solved.
Not only are we still relying on the piecemeal
technique which Secretary Marshall justly condemned in his celebrated speech, but we are confining our efforts to the diplomatie, or governmentto-government approach. We approached this complex of problems first on a universal government-togovernment basis, through Bretton Woods, the
International Bank and Fund, the United Nations,

the International Trade Organization, the Baruch
plan. When that approach didn't work, we got
down to the heart of the problem in the North
Atlantic area-but still we tackled each side of it
separately on this government-to-government diplomatie basis, in the Marshall Plan, the North
Atlantic Treaty, the rearmament program.
The Atlantic Union resolution-

Which I have read,
-would not, I repeat, prevent continued efforts
along these lines, or any of the variations of them
that have been proposed in other Resolutions. But
it would permit us to try also to solve this complex
of problems by tackling them (1) as a whole; (2) in
company with the Canadian, British, French and
Benelux democracies with whom we share most
closely these economie, military, monetary, and
atomic problems, and who sponsored with us the
North Atlantic Pact; and (3) on the man-to-man
federal union basis of our own U.S. Constitution.
Surely this practical, 100 per cent American
approach should not be the one approach to the
problem that we should refuse even to try.

Honourable senators will observe that what
I arn saying is merely a suggestion that the
Canadian people and the Canadian Parliament should think over the suggestion made
by our American friends, supported by other
democracies. We would not be committed
to anything, but I should hope that if such
a convention or conference is ever called,
Canada would not refrain from attending it.
I do not wish to read a great deal more. I
know that quotations are not interestingSome Hon. Senators: Go on.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -but I should like to put
on record one or two comments upon this
proposal. It is stated that:
Several newspapers commented on the first major
statement on foreign policy made by Senator Estes
Kefauver in the Senate July 13. Senator Kefauver
strongly advocated passage of the North Atlantic
Pact primarily as a device to give the free peoples
of the North Atlantic area time to work out a union.
An editorial in the Chattanooga Times (which was
reprinted in the Congressional Record) said that
Kefauver had "made a persuasive appeal for an
Atlantic union . . . his Senate address provides the
Nation with a thought-provoking thesis worthy of
closest consideration."

That is all I ask today.

The Washington Post wrote:
It is a concept to which one returns irresistably
in contemplating the true inwardness of the British
crisis. . . . If the real solvent of the British crisis
is, as we feel it, on the political level, then the
nature of that solvent is obvious. It lies in . . .
union."
Like many another newspaper-

This magazine goes on.
Post felt the AUC resolution should have

seems to think that a call for a constitutional convention of the democracies would find a response.
It is, it seems to us, worth exploring with our Canadian neighbours now with the Atlantic Pact (which
is a military recognition of the oneness of the
Atlantic community) is out of the way, and worthy
of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee."

OCTOBER 5, 1949
I will read just one other quotation, taken
from an English newspaper, the London
Observer:
The London Observer thought it curious that "in
international politics the greatest and boldest ideas
make the least immediate impact on public
opinion." Then, describing the introduction of the
resolution, it went on to say, "So far there bas
been hardly any comment anywhere on this revolutionary idea: and yet the motion . . . confronts us
with the greatest issue of our time." Highly in
favour of the project, the Observer remarked that
"all the difficulties and worries of the day press in
the direction of an Atlantic Federation. Whether
we think of the security of Western Europe, of the
dollar crisis, or of the British-American dispute
about the atom-bomb, there is no permanent and
wholly satisfactory solution to any of these problems except in the context of an Atlantic State.
"We are at present trying to achieve for the
Atlantic community of nations the stability, the
security, and the economic unity which are the
normal attributes of a State, without daring to
make an Atlantic State. . . . It is not only grander
and more inspiring, but far easier and more sensible
to face the fact that the common permanent
interests of the Atlantic nations demand a common
federal state."

I might also give citations from the French
Press.
All the comments I have read favour the
idea. I daresay there are editorial opinions
which oppose it, though I have none such
before me. I realize that in Canada it might
create objections. Some may come from our
industrialists; I do not know. I do not believe
there would be any objections from the Maritimes, Newfoundland or the prairies. The
honourable senator who has just spoken
remarked that he was in favour of free trade.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: For the prairies!
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have been wrongly tagged
in some quarters as a high protectionist. It
might be well that I should amplify at this
point what I said was my attitude with regard
to tariffs when I was a member of the House
of Commons. My position was this: so long
as the United States keeps its markets closed
to Canadian goods, so long I believe should
the Canadian producer-if you like, the Canadian manufacturer-have some preference in
his own home market.
I realize that the birth-pangs attending a
union of this kind might be somewhat disturbing, but I am taking the long, over-all
view. During the last war the Canadian held
his own with the American producer. We
know that in the United States any number of
smaller producers, including manufacturers,

can compete with the great industries of that
country and survive; and if the Canadian
were assured of the permanency of that great
American market of 150 million people, I
think he could hold his own, that he would
adapt himself, and that in the long run he
might be better off than he is now.
I am not by any means making a free trade
speech. I would say again that my sole purpose in what I am saying here today is to give
rise if possible-even though the stimulus
comes from a senator-to some thought and
some discussion. It is true that much of what
is said here receives very little attention in
the press of Canada. I do not ask any special
treatment in this regard. Perhaps I might add
that what we say here does not always receive
a great deal of attention from the government
itself. But this subject is worthy of consideration and discussion. I realize that the action
I have suggested would mean the coming of
a new era. I bring the matter forward in the
hope that it will give food for careful thought
and discussion; and if ultimately the two half
worlds, the federated democratic half, on the
one hand, and the communistic half led by
the Soviets, on the other, were to come
together, certainly that would be "a consummation devoutly to be wish'd", and the
development of fission of the atom would be
continued for the benefit of all mankind
rather than for its destruction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would ask the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
if he has read Mr. Streit's remarkable book
entitled Union Now?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is an authoritative
piece of work.
Hon. Mr. Euler: As a matter of fact, Mr.
Streit has a great deal to do with the
publication that I have before me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would recommend the
perusal of those pages to any honourable
senator who has listened, with the same
interest as I have, to the address which has
just been delivered by the honourable senator
frorn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).

debate was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Lambert presented Bill N-1, an
Act to incorporate the Prairie Pipelines
Limited.
The bill was read the first time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, may I briefly indicate for your information my proposals as to future sittings. Some
little time ago I stated that it was my hope
to be able to present for the consideration
of the Senate sufficient legislation and other
business to keep us in session each week
until at least the end of October. Unfortunately the progress made in the other place
with important legislation has not been such
as to confirm that hope, and later this afternoon I intend to ask the house to consider
a motion that when we adjourn we stand
adjourned until Monday, the 17th day of
October, at 8 p.m., when I trust there will be
a considerable amount of business before
both this house and its committees.
In order to facilitate hearings on the pipelines legislation, the chairman of the committee concerned has arranged that a meeting of the committee be held on Tuesday
morning next at Il o'clock. When the
Bankruptcy Bill receives second reading here,
it will be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, and I shall endeavour to
arrange a meeting of that committee so that
any interested parties will have an opportunity to make representations. In the meantime I have no alternative but to move as
I have indicated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have received requests,
verbal and otherwise, for copies of this bill,
and I understand it is not the practice to
give copies of bills to the public until they
have been read a second time.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The bills may go to
the public at any time. However, the Bankruptcy Bill is up for second reading today,
and the progress we make in that regard is
up to the house.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
leader if it is intended to have meetings of

BANKRUPTCY

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of bill F, an Act respecting bankruptcy.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Carleton to
explain this bill.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Honourable senators,
it has sometimes been said that legislation
in Canada is passed hastily and that those
interested and the public in general are not
given an opportunity to study its provisions.
I do not think that can be said of this Bill F,
which appears to have had a rather checkered
career. This, I believe, is the fourth time
that the bill has been introduced in this
honourable house. It was first brought down
in the year 1946, in a somewhat different
form from the present measure, and was laid
over for study for a period during which
representations concerning it were made.
Subsequently, in 1948, it came up again in
a revised form. And, as most honourable
senators will remember, it was introduced for
a third time at the first session of this year,
but unfortunately, owing to early dissolution,
consideration of it was not completed. The
present bill, I am informed, with very few
exceptions is practically identical with the
bill that was before the Senate last session.
Generally speaking this bill, like any bankruptcy legislation, is designed to provide
machinery for liquidation and distribution in
an equitable manner of the estates of insolvent persons. It applies to all business and
commercial concerns, and also to wage
earners earning more than $2,500 a year. It
does not apply to people carrying on the
business of farming, who are covered in turn
by special legislation.

I am going to take a minute or two to
review the history of Canadian bankruptcy
legislation generally, which, strangely enough,
like that of the present bill, has been somewhat checkered. Before confederation there
were insolvency Acts in the various provinces.
The first dominion legislation on the subject
was passed in 1869. That was known as the
Insolvency Act, and applied to traders only.
In 1875 that statute was revised and consolidated, but the administration did not prove
to be satisfactory and the Act was repealed
in 1880. In the interval between 1880 and
1919, almost forty years, there was no
dominion bankruptcy legislation. Some of
the provinces, of course, had insolvency Acts
and provisions for assignments and insolvency. After the hiatus of nearly forty years,
the present Bankruptcy Act was passed in
1919. It was then a completely new code,
modelled upon the English Statute of 1914.
Some amendments were made in 1931, and in
1932 there were substantial amendments,
providing, among other things, for the
appointment of an officer known as the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy, to supervise
the administration of estates under the Act.
The volume of estates in bankruptcy in
Canada has varied over the years very substantially. The highest number was in 1933,
when there were 2,600 estates under administration; in 1936 there were 1,100, and the
low ebb was reached in 1945 with 265. I
have not before me the exact figures as to
the number of estates in bankruptcy since
1945, but my recollection is that last year
there were about 700.
The general procedure under the bill before
us, which I shall explain briefly, is as follows:
A debtor who becomes insolvent may become
a bankrupt either by his own act of making
a voluntary assignment or by the act of one
or more of his creditors who have claims
against him aggregating $1,000. Under the
present Act the claims need only aggregate
$500. Whether he becomes a bankrupt by
his own act, the functionary with whom he
deals is known as an official receiver. There
are several of these officials, appointed for
the purpose, in various parts of the country.
The official receiver then calls a meeting of
creditors at which a trustee of the estate is
appointed; the creditors then appoint inspectors. With the assistance and advice of the
inspectors, the assets of the estate are then
realized on and distributed in accordance
with the regulations provided for that purpose. This operation is carried on under the
general supervision of the superintendent
and the court.
I should point out that under the Act now
in force the first functionary appointed is
known as the custodian, who carries on until
such time as a meeting of creditors is called

SENATE
and a trustee appointed. Under this bill the
office of the custodian is eliminated, and the
Official Receiver appoints a trustee licensed
by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy with
the approval of the minister. At their first
meeting the creditors may, if they wish,
carry on with the trustee appointed by the
Official Receiver, or they may appoint a new
trustee.
The bankruptcy bill is a voluminous one,
and it would not be proper for me at this
time to discuss its many sections. I have
found, and many honourable senators know,
that the late Mr. Reilley, Superintendent of
Bankruptcy, and his successor, Judge Forsyth, received many compliments from the
committee of this house which studied the
bill, and from those who made representations before that committee.
The bill provides a more orderly arrangement of subjects and the language in many
sections of the Act has been simplified. One
or two of the more notable changes should
be mentioned. The bill reinstates a provision
which was in the Bankruptcy Act of 1919.
During the period from 1919 to 1923 the
Act contained a provision whereby an insolvent person could make a proposal to his
creditors without making an assignment or
having a receiving order made against him,
and thereby suffering the stigma of bankruptcy. The bill now provides that an insolvent person may make such a proposal withof
out going through the procedure
bankruptcy.
A further change which bas been generally
accepted as an improvement, is a code for
the administration of small estates in an
economical and inexpensive manner. This
section of the bill covers estates with assets
of $500 or less, and provides a simplified
procedure for their administration. A subject which will be dealt with by the committee is the "Scheme of Distribution", which
is covered by section 95 of the bill. This
section lays down the order of priority in
which claims shall be dealt with. Difficult
and vexing problems in years gone by, concerning which creditors should be paid first,
give rise to this change. I think the section
will clarify the situation and avoid some
of the confusion which has existed in the
past.
Section 64 of the bill, which deals with
fraudulent preferences, contains quite substantial changes. An endeavour bas been
made to avoid the many instances of litigation
arising out of administration of estates. Perhaps I should read section 64 (1). It is as
follows:
Every transaction, whether or not entered into
voluntarily or under pressure, by an insolvent person who becomes bankrupt within six months thereafter and resulting in any person or any creditor
or any person in trust for such creditor or any

surety or guarantor for the debt due to such
creditor obtaining a preference, advantage or benefit over the creditors or any of them, is void against
the trustee.

The new words of significance are "resulting
in any person getting a preference". The
previous section, also numbered 64, was
somewhat differently worded, but the operative words to which I direct your attention
in the old section read, "with a view of giving
such creditor a preference". This new section, therefore, appears to have removed the
necessity for determining the intent of the
bankrupt, and, as was the law in certain
provinces, of the creditor concerned. Some
differences had arisen in the jurisprudence
as between provinces. In some provinces the
doctrine of concurrent intent was developed
and the courts were inclined to look not only
at the intent of the insolvent but also at the
intent of the creditor who got the preference.
No doubt this new section 64 will be discussed
in committee. Obviously the intention is to
remove the uncertainty which everyone
familiar with bankruptcy laws knows existed
under the former section. It has been argued,
and no doubt will be argued again, that where
a body of law has been built up around the
old section 64, and some people at least know
what they think the law is, it ought not to be
changed even though the new Act may be
admitted to be an improvement.

One other notable innovation of this bill is
found in sections 127 to 129, which deal with
the discharge of bankrupts. Under the existing legislation it has been necessary for a
bankrupt, after the administration was completed, to apply to get his discharge. For
various reasons, whether because the debtor
did not know be was entitled to do this, or
for other reasons, it was not customary for
bankrupts to apply for their discharge. Following legislation in other countries-I think
in the United States, and perhaps in Australia
-this
bill incorporates what might be
regarded as an automatic application for discharge, because the occurring of the bankruptcy through assignment or receiving order
in the first instance is also treated as an

course has to satisfy the court that he qualifies before be gets his discharge, and the conditions are laid down.
To move on quickly and in a very summary
way: there are other miscellaneous provisions
which might be mentioned. The new bill
vests a greater measure of control in the
creditors and inspectors. The powers of the

superintendent have been made more explicit.
As I have said, the superintendent, with the

approval of the minister, licenses trustees.
A creditor may now proceed in his own name

where the trustee neglects or refuses to act

in a given case. The remuneration of trustees
has been increased; that is, the maximum
remuneration bas been enlarged from 5 to 7j
per cent. The estate of a deceased debtor
may now be administered. The duties and
fees of inspectors have been increased. Provision is made for the proving of all claims,
whereas formerly certain claims were not
covered. The duties of the bankrupt have
been clarified and extended. The courts of
Newfoundland and the Northwest Territories
have been vested with the necessary jurisdiction. The powers of the registrar have been
extended and clarified. The provisions re
legal costs have been revised. Bankruptcy
offences have been revised and, in most
cases, made triable by summary conviction.
Al provisions of the bill have been made
applicable to the Crown. This would probably
not affect the Crown as a debtor but, at any
rate in most cases, as a creditor; and in
respect of a composition or proposal the
Crown would be bound as the others.
As I have said, the intention of the bill is
to clarify and simplify the legislation. There
will be ample opportunity in the committee
to examine the particular provisions which
I have mentioned and to hear representations
in respect of them.
The bill was read the second time.

one look from him will restore calm and
order.
The mover of the address in reply (Hon.
Mr. Godbout), who is a good friend of mine,
has performed his task with the poise and
brilliance which he bas always shown
throughout his career. Those of us who
could follow his speech in French were in a
position to appreciate his impeccable language and diction, which were worthy of a
scholar.
I fully appreciated the story of Newfoundland told by our good friend, the seconder
of the Address (Hon. Mr. Petten). His province is the oldest part of Canada, having been
discovered even before Quebec.
In the
French language we call his island province
"Terre-Neuve", which might be translated as
meaning "Young Land", and the contribution
it will make to confederation may well place
our country in a state of prosperity.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
speak for very long, but I am afraid that the
two points I wish to discuss will place me in
the same position that my honourable colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) occupied yesterday, when he apparently spoke,

of fifty dollars a week is required to maintain
a decent standard of living and a minimum
level of health in a family of five paying f orty
dollars' rent monthly. This finding was
arrived at by the Council after a six-month
survey of the essential needs of such a family.
Do you wish to know the weekly distribution
of those fifty dollars? In the opinion of the
Council, a family of five should spend $82.98
per month on food; $34.68 on clothing; $3.54 on
repairs to clothing; $4.24 for transportation;
$15.64 for recreation, personal allowances and

92 cents; recreational programs in the home,
$1.33; cleaning, 68 cents; heating, $8.65; hot
water, $2.82. Yearly savings would thus
amount to $24.00. It would, therefore, take
some forty years for a family to put aside
$1,000, provided the $24 savings were
deposited in the bank at 11 per cent interest.
Under the circumstances, I am afraid not
many of our workers will ever become home
owners.
Under the new Housing Act, could not a
solution be found to the problem of workers
earning an income such as I have just mentioned, so that by paying a reasonable rent
they may some day become masters in their
own houses? We are given to understand
that there is an act under which the federal
government is ready to advance 75 per cent
of the cost of a multiple-dwelling house, provided the province supplies the remaining
25 per cent. Could we not do the same thing
for housing co-operatives? I admit that the
extension of such facilities to each individual
may lead to abuses. In the case of housing
co-operatives, however, almost all such
abuses can be prevented, because their
members are carefully selected. The selection
of a new member is first based on his moral
character and integrity, and such moral
qualities, after all, do mean something and
are even more valuable than many promissory
notes.
In the province of Quebec, on a loan of
$6,000 the government pays the interest up
to a maximum of 3 per cent. Now, if the
loans granted by housing co-operatives were
to be guaranteed by both governments, lending companies could reduce somewhat their
rate of interest. A loan of $6,000 at 42 per
cent, repayable in twenty years, requires a
monthly outlay of only $37.96; and again a
$7,000 loan at 42 per cent, repayable in
twenty-five years, means a monthly instalment of $38.91. Some may say that a $6,000

or a $7,000 home is not a mansion. I agree.
However we do not want to build mansions,
we want to build homes.
Reverting to housing co-operatives, each
member of those which I have seen in operation did part of the inside work on their
homes, such as painting, carpentry and plumbing. All this means a saving in the building
costs and, at the same time, a better guarantee for the money-lenders. Indeed, a man
who has worked himself on his own home is
much more attached to it and more anxious
to keep it in good shape.
Municipalities could also contribute, without making outright gifts to home-builders.
For example, in the case of housing co-operatives, municipal authorities could have the
lots prepared and levelled, and perhaps the
cellar excavated; this while not costing them
very much would mean a great deal to each
member of such co-operatives. It would also
help to promote town-planning. You have
no idea how constructive and inspiring is this
spirit of co-operation!
The second point which I want to discuss
with you, honourable senators, is the devaluation of currency.
Last week, I followed closely the excellent
acount of our friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), and I would like to add my
views to his. I fear, however, as our friend
from Waterloo put it, that what I may say will
fall upon deaf ears. Nevertheless, if I repeat
as often as possible and indicate the danger
which is upon us, there may be a few here
and there, who will be willing to take heed and
try to apply these principles. Who knows?
The mustard seed may yet become a large
tree.
Devaluation of currency can only be a
temporary remedy, a remedy which may well
cease to be effective if all countries, as seems
to be the case, resort to it. We are then
exactly where we were before. If we were
willing to try it, there is however another
means of obtaining the results we are seeking,
not by using depreciated currency but by
using a currency which has always had
the same value and will retain it to the end
of time,-the value of work.
We want to sell cheaper in order to lay
our hands on other countries' markets. Let
us organize in such a way that we may be
able to produce more cheaply and more
rapidly. Let us take the means to manufacture in half an hour the goods it took

SENATE
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, and in welcoming the new members who recently have joined us in this
chamber.
I have listened with keen interest to those
who have already spoken in this debate;
and while I do not intend to make a lengthy
speech, I should like to discuss a few points
with regard to world trade. Devaluation of
the pound has not solved the trade problems
of the democracies or the English-speaking
world by any means. It is only a start. It
seems to me that devaluation deals with an
effect, not with a cause. The difficulties that
confront both international and empire trading are many, but they are all really manmade, and what man does as far as trade
goes he can undo.
Take the position of the United Kingdom,
our best customer. England has outstanding
more than 13 billion pounds in short term
debts which she owes to many nations. Most
of this debt was incurred during the last
world war, the money being spent on the
endeavour to preserve the democratic way of
life, which we in America so much enjoy
today.
Something has to be done to reduce and
refund this debt; and to a great extent this
is the responsibility of the democratic world.
A large percentage of British exports today
are "dead horse," for they go to pay interest
and principal on foreign war debts. Since
the recent war England has given to continental Europe more than 900 million pounds
of unrequited exports, and hundreds of
millions of pounds go annually to Asia and
Africa, where England has large obligations.
These are so large that they are almost
unbearable, and they hang like a hopeless,
dark cloud over Empire trading. Much has
been written about the dollar crisis, as though
it were a Commonwealth problem. The fact
that the United States has an annual favourable trade balance of around $7 billion seems
to have been somewhat overlooked. Of this
amount the sterling area gap accounts for
only about $1,600 million. It is generally
agreed that if Great Britain did manage to
export another $200 million worth of goods
to the United States it would be quite an
achievement. England has little, if anything,
to export in the way of raw materials; therefore any additional exports would have to
consist of manufactured goods.
An examination of the figures in an effort
to find a solution, indicates that it does not
greatly matter whether the sterling deficit
is $1,400 million or $1,600 million, for even
if Britain could perform a miracle, and square
her annual trade deficit with the United
States, the rest of the world would still have
a trade deficit with that country of $5,600

million. It can pretty well be taken for
granted that without serious internal readjustment, the United States economic setup at the moment is such that she cannot
take enough imports to balance her exports.
Considering the serious economie situation
which exists, one can see that little was
accomplished at the meetings in Washington
to really solve the fundamental problem of
getting international trade in balance.
After many years of trading with most
nations of the world, one thing I am sure
of is that the exporting nations must
ultimately take back imports for what they
send abroad. Otherwise they will, in time,
have to make a present to the debtor nations.
All that any nation has with which to pay
her bills is the return she gets from what
she produces.
Conditions being what they are today,
Canada cannot sit on the sidelines. Our
dependence on foreign trade is around 25
per cent of our total trade, that of the United
States is less than 7 per cent, and that of
England is about 17 per cent. The position
of this country in the matter of dependence
on international trade is self-evident. Further,
Canada cannot sit by and see the globe
divided into three economic worlds-the
totalitarian states, the dollar area, and the
sterling area. Such an economic division
would be fatal, for we would find it impossible to survive against the competition of
dictator states. The democracies must have
a united front, and must work vigorously to
survive and prosper.
The British Empire could be the greatest
territorial trading unit of the world, for it
possesses more raw materials for the purpose
of foreign trade than either the United States
or Russia. Other parts of the Commonwealth
are looking to Canada for leadership. True,
we led them into the Bretton Woods agreement-and what a dense jungle it turned out
to be. I cannot see that the world bank or
the monetary fund has done anything for
the Commonwealth except to take its money
by the billions of dollars. As the Finance
Minister of Australia said, the only transaction that country ever had with the world
monetary fund was when it collected a deposit
of over $400 million.
I think the nations, including our own,
should get rid of the controls as soon as
possible, and let each of the respective
mediums of exchange find its own level.
In that way we would soon get exchangeability and convertibility at some level. These
are things we have not got today.
A clearing house for money is absolutely
essential for the carrying on of world trade.
Controls served us very well in wartime, but
the war has now been over for four years.

OCTOBER 6. 1949
We are allowing too many people, members
of boards and so-called experts, to do our
thinking for us. This country was built up
by pioneers who did their own thinking, and
I certainly choose to do my own when I can.
International money systems should be
handed back to private enterprise. When
that is done, private traders who are now
sitting on the sidelines will get busy with
their venture capital. International traders
will risk their money in competition with one
another, but not in competition with governments who can change the rules of the game,
including values, overnight. During wartime
it may have been necessary to fix prices, but,
as said previously, the war has now been
over for several years, and we should get
away from the things that are false and
unreal, and return to the things that are true
and sound. The true value of money is what
it is worth in the markets of the world, without artificial interference.
We find fault with the dictator states, and
the way their governments have of fixing the
prices of commodities. Anyone who lives
behind the Iron Curtain and goes into a
government store to make a purchase of goods
finds that the prices have been fixed-and
he can pay the fixed price or else. All trade
consists of transactions. Half of the transaction is the exchange of real wealth, such
as lumber, fish, farm products and so forth,
and the other half is the exchange of money.
Now, it is just about as bad for governments
to fix the value of money as it is to fix the
price of goods. Each is equally important
and plays an equal part in our trading transactions. Almost all of our income as a nation
comes from trade. We take the raw materials
from the land and the sea, and from them we
prepare commodities for markets either at
home or abroad.
As has been stated, export trade is
extremely important to Canada. In these
circumstances we should pay greater attention to our fellow members of the British Commonwealth. They are looking to us to show
the way. Great Britain has enormous real
wealth, but it is encountering very serious
economic troubles of a temporary nature
because of two world wars. We have a
surplus of goods, and it would indeed be a
far-sighted policy in this time of emergency
to extend a helping hand to our sister nations
of the Commonwealth. Such nations as South
Africa, Australia and New Zealand have an
abundance of natural resources, and there is
no question but that in due course they will
be able to return value for any goods and
services that we extend to them at this time
of trade crisis.
It has been asked many times what is the
remedy for the world trade crisis. I have

studied the situation hours on end, and read
practically all available material on this subject, but the only real solution I can find is
in the proposals adopted by the Federated
Chambers of Commerce of the British
Empire, which met at Johannesburg, South
Africa last year. These proposals were forwarded to this country for consideration but
nothing was done about them. Some of the
best brains of the Empire met at this conference. Many of the delegates had spent their
lives in world trade and understood trade
problems, I think, thoroughly from a practical standpoint. The report of this important
congress and the detailed proposals they
sponsored and asked us to consider with a
view of adoption are available to honourable
senators.
To put the proposals in short form: nations
were asked to fully recognize the fundamental fact that exports must be paid for by
imports, and that debtor nations have no
other way to make international payments
except by their own production of goods and
services. Any creditor nations not desiring
to take imports at once, either directly or
multilaterally, from a nation in their debt,
would accept a credit from such debtor
nation. It would be like a bank account held
within the debtor nation or by central banks,
but at the disposai of creditor nations, to be
used bilaterally or multilaterally, and the
creditor nation would be allowed seven years
within which to exercise the credit or dispose of it to another nation. After that period
the Statute of Limitation would apply in the
same manner as it does to internal debt. In
this way a creditor nation would be able to
control its imports according to need over a
seven year period. What I mean by that is it
could take more in some years and less in
others, but it would have to square the
account in seven years or lose out. At
present, nations have no guarantee that a
willing seller to the world is a willing buyer
from it. So long as this is so, imports may
result in the buying nations finding themselves with an unpayable debt, since the selling nation may refuse to take payment in the
only possible manner, namely, in imports,
whether directly or through a third country.
The chambers of commerce of the Empire
feel, and I agree with them, that a system
whereby the credits of any nation on the rest
of the world, arising from exports and not
cleared by imports, become proscribed, would
be a powerful inducement to countries with
export surpluses to take energetic action with
a view of bringing up the total value of their
imports to figures that would roughly correspond with the value of their exports ov'er,
say a seven year period.

SENATE
In the old days nations having an international trade deficit were generally able
to float a loan and keep going; but the debt
system is all played out. The world is now
piled sky-high with debts; they have reached
unheard-of heights. A very large portion of
them is unconverted and non-convertible.
The increase between 1939 and 1946 was ten
times all the debts accumulated from the time
of Adam until 1939. Anyway unpaid debts
only put off the evil day of settlement, and
interest compounds in the meantime.
Now the only possible thing to do is to
make trade a two-way street in every sense
of the word, and I am satisfied that the Federated Chambers of Commerce of the British
Empire have shown us the way.
I would like to say a word here about our
trade with the United States.
The United States market is at our door.
Congress recently extended for another year
President Truman's power to slash tariffs
fifty per cent; and I believe that if this
country would put forth exhaustive efforts
we could suceed in getting a reduction of
one-half on many commodities shipped to the
United States. I have before me a copy of
the well-known publication The Wall Street
Journal, under date of September 29, with
the following headlines:
President Truman will breach tariff wall on 250
items now and many more later.
Forty nations, duty-slashing session planned for
1950.
The article continues:
About October 10 Mr. Truman will announce a
slash in import duties for around 250 commodities
and manufactured goods ...
You can expect United
States concessions on a great variety of important
and unimportant goods-some dairy products, textiles, laces, hardware, table utensils, leather goods,
wood products, cordials, jellies, jams, candied fruits,
rum fruits, musical instruments, seeds, machinery
of a certain type, molasses, granite, light hand
lenses, etc. The October pact will only be the
beginning. State Department experts are already
preparing for a 1950 tariff-trimming session on a
grander scale with 40 nations. The idea is that
American negotiators at the next World Conference
would agree to reduce many more United States
duties as far as the present law allows, i.e. 50 per
cent below the rates of 1945. Congress does not
have to be consulted on either the 1949 or the
projected 1950 assault on the tariff wall. It has
already granted President Truman blanket authority which lasts until mid-year 1951.
The ten
nations which agreed at Annecy, France, a few
months ago to make equivalent tariff reductions
were Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Greece,
Liberia, Haiti, The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua
and Uruguay.

Although we had delegates at the conference, nothing is stated in the article about
Canada; yet we are the largest customer of
the United States. The American hope is to
bring American imports into better balance
with exports, which are now largely sustained
by the Marshall Plan. The British, in particular, are pushing for lower duties on goods

they want to sell in the United States. The
French also are working for United States
tariff cuts: they have presented a list of over
two hundred commodities on which they want
reductions.
The opportunity is ours! President Truman
is holding out the olive branch in the direction of tariff reduction. We are nearest to
the United States and, as I have said, their
largest customers. President Truman, I think,
realizes that nations can only pay for their
imports by what they can produce for export,
and that a creditor nation should not ask for
payment and then put all kinds of impediments, such as high tariffs, in the way of
payment by the debtor nation. In these times
it is useless for nations to bar imports by
means of high tariffs and then ask for payment in their own respective currencies, over
which a debtor nation has no control whatsoever. What control have other nations over
Canadian money? What control have we over
United States money? Yet, when we sell
abroad, we tell our customers "You must pay
us in our own currency." I know of a lot of
items produced by the fish industry that
would have a much larger sale in the United
States if the duty were reduced. Some of
these brands of fish are not produced in the
United States. The effect of the present
United States tariff is simply to put up the
cost of living at the expense of the working
man across the border; and this, I would
think is contrary to the policy of a democracy.
I know that many other Canadian industries
besides fisheries could point to numerous
items on which the United States tariff could
well be substantially reduced to help bring
our trade accounts into balance.
The policy now in force across the border,
as I have stated, is to help other countries to
close the gap, so that each country's imports
will be balanced by her exports; and Canada
should be up and doing, and should seize
every opportunity to bring into balance our
account with the United States. It is only
common sense on the part of the United
States to try and do what it can to balance
its trade with the world. Normal trade is
carried on by individual traders.
If two farmers live side by side, one
raising beef cattle and the other coarse grains,
they can do a profitable business together
as long as their trade balances. We shall
say that the farmer who raises coarse grains
supplies feed to the farmer who raises beef
cattle. All will be fine as long as the coarsegrain farmer takes back enough beef cattle,
directly or indirectly, to pay for the feed
grain; but trouble will begin as soon as he
loses interest in the beef market and
endeavours to put the beef cattle farmer in
debt. He will soon be taking a mortgage

OCTOBER 6, 1942
or a bill of sale, and he will lose a customer
as the debt grows. The traders of the world
are the farmers, fishermen, lumbermen,
miners, manufacturers and so on, or those
who act for them.
Honourable senators, I spoke earlier of
the Commonwealth being the greatest potential trading unit of the globe, and stated
that other parts of the Commonwealth are
looking to Canada for leadership in this
time of trade crisis. Well, I do not know
of a time in the last thirty years when trade
within the Commonwealth has been so helplessly disorganized. More than ever in our
history we have the goods, or real wealth.
If the British Commonwealth had suddenly
been turned into a Sahara desert we would
have had a real excuse for a trade crisis,
but a wise Creator has been most kind to us.
We can produce all kinds of real wealth, but
we cannot distribute it properly among ourselves. The other great trading territorial
units of the world are the United States
and Soviet Russia. What would you think
of the State of Texas not being able to ship
goods to New York because that city has
the wrong kind of money; or the State of
Georgia in Russia not being able to ship
commodities to Moscow because of exchange
difficulties? Such a condition would be fantastic and unheard of; but we in the British
Commonwealth are unable to exchange our
goods just because we are bedevilled with
many different kinds of money. It reminds
one of the Tower of Babel; instead of being
cursed with a multiplicity of different
languages, our downfall is caused by a score
or more of different mediums of exchange,
few of which are interchangeable. I know
that many former large customers of this
country in other parts of the Commonwealth,
although they are rated by Dun and Bradstreet's in the millions, cannot today buy a
$10 case of fish here.
In these circumstances how is the Commonwealth going to compete with other
great trading nations? This is a time when
Canada can give leadership in helping to
straighten out this trade mess. There are
many experienced members in this honourable body who could give a helping hand
if called uponHon. Mr. Duff: We are never asked.
Hon. Mr. McLean: -That is right. We
are seldom, if ever, asked to do so. Many
of our powers have been handed over to
various boards-theoretical experts who,
whether they have had trade experience or
not, are doing a lot of our thinking for us
in these all-important trade matters. Until
the system is changed, I suppose we shall
have to abide by their decisions, whether
they involve a step in the dark or not.

Honourable senators, I thank you for having had the patience to listen to me for so
long. I have simply tried to place on the
record the benefit of any experience I may
have had during the last thirty years in dealing in the foreign markets of the world.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

noon to the consideration of the principle

SENATE
which I mentioned a moment ago, leaving
the details of the bill to be considered in
committee in the careful way in which this
chamber always considers measures of this
kind.
I have said that the purpose of the bill is
to abolish appeals in civil cases to the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. I should
perhaps remind honourable senators that
appeals in criminal cases were abolished some
years ago, and that the right of this parliament to abolish criminal appeals was finally
decided by the Privy Council in the judgment
which it gave in the British Coal Corporation
case in 1935.
May I begin with a brief and necessarily
sketchy historical review of the subject?
From time immemorial it has been the
recognized right of British subjects, as a
final resort, to appeal to the Sovereign for
justice; and the Sovereign has accorded
justice in the exercise of the Royal prerogative. That right has extended to British subjects resident in the colonies, as those colonies
were established in different parts of the
world. In the old days this right was exercised, I understand, through the governors
of the colonies concerned.
In the year 1833 the British Parliament, of
which my grandfather was a member, enacted
a statute regulating the manner in which such
appeals to the Crown should be dealt with,
and provided that they be heard by a judicial
committee of the Privy Council, to advise the
Crown as to how the cases which came before
it should be disposed of. The title of the body
is, as I said, the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council; but for purposes of brevity,
during the remainder of my remarks I shall
simply refer to it by its ordinary name, the
Privy Council.
As all members of this chamber who are
lawyers know, the Judicial Committee does
not render judgments; its function is to
advise the Sovereign. All the decisions of the
Privy Council end with these words: "Their
Lordships will therefore humbly advise His
Majesty accordingly." That was the position
when the British North America Act was
enacted by the British Parliament in 1867.
By section 129 of the Act all the courts in
existence in the various provinces at confederation continued to function as before,
and the right of appeal from those courts to
the Privy Council, where it existed, remained
unaffected. Section 101 of the British North
America Act authorized the Parliament of
Canada, as and when it might see fit, to set
up a general court of appeal for Canada. This
is the wording of section 101:
The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding
anything in this Act, from time to time provide for
the constitution, maintenance and organization of

a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the
establishment of any additional courts for the better
administration of the laws of Canada.

Now, the setting up of the Supreme
Court under this section in the few
years immediately following Confederation
appears to have been attended with considerable difficulty. In the year 1870 the administration of Sir John A. Macdonald introduced
a bill to create a supreme court; but the bill
was withdrawn. Again in the year 1871 a bill
to constitute a supreme court was introduced,
but was again withdrawn. Finally, in the
session of 1875, the Mackenzie government
introduced a similar bill. That bill was submitted to the House of Commons by the
Honourable Mr. Fournier, at that time
Minister of Justice in the Mackenzie administration. As originally introduced, that bill
made no reference to appeals to the Privy
Council. But in the course of the discussion
in the other chamber, the Minister of Justice
invited the house to express its opinion as to
whether the bill should not contain a clause
making the decisions of the new Supreme
Court final, and abolishing appeals to the
Privy Council. Following upon that suggestion, the insertion of a new clause in the
bill for that purpose was moved by Mr.
Irving, the member for Hamilton, and upon
a vote of 112 to 40 that clause was inserted
in the bill. The text of that new section,
which was section 47 of the Supreme Court
Bill, is this:
47. The judgment of the Supreme Court shall in
all cases be final and conclusive, and no appeal shall
be brought from any judgment or order of the
Supreme Court to any Court of Appeal established
by the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland,
by which appeals or petitions to Her Majesty in
Council may be ordered to be heard: saving any
right which Her Majesty may be graciously pleased
to exercise by virtue of Her Royal Prerogative.

It is abundantly clear from the discussions
on this bill in the other house that the members thought that by inserting section 47 in

the bill they were effectually abolishing
appeals to the Privy Council. It was in that
form that the bill came to the Senate.
I have looked up the Debates of the Senate
for 1875, and with the permission of honourable senators I propose to take a few minutes
to describe the proceedings on the bill in
this chamber. As was the case in the House
of Commons, it was manifestly clear that the
Senate believed that appeals to the Privy
Council were being abolished, and indeed
much of the discussion ranged around that
very subject. It is also clear from the discussions that this bouse believed that one
of the principal functions of the new Supreme
Court would be finally to adjudicate on constitutional disputes, which even at that day
were arising between the dominion and the

OCTOBER 18, 1949
provinces as to their respective powers of
legislation under sections 91 and 92 of the
British North America Act.
I should like to refer in detail to the
report of the Senate Debates of 1875, and I
would remind honourable senators that in
those days the speeches for the most part
were not reported verbatim as they are today.
However, the substance of what the speakers
said was given in the third person.
The second reading of the bill was moved
on April 5, 1875, by the Honourable Mr.
Letellier de St. Just, Minister of Agriculture
in the Mackenzie government, and afterwards
Lieutenant-Governor of the province of
Quebec. Mr. Letellier started out by referring
to the constitution of the new court which,
he said, was to consist of six judges, two of
whom would be members of the Bar of the
province of Quebec. He then immediately
proceeded to consider the question of the
abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. He
supported this on a ground which is novel to
me, but which I am sure will interest honourable senators from the province of Quebec.
He said:
They had found with Her Majesty's Privy
Council much learning, ability, and a strong desire
to determine justly the cases from Lower Canada
and the rest of this country, but though these
honourable judges were well versed in English
statutory law and in French law, they exercised a
certain discrimination in the application of the
French law in cases from Lower Canada, because,
since the adoption of the Code Napoleon, many of
the laws of France differed from the Coutume de
Paris observed in Quebec.
The English judges
learned in the present and recent French law, but
not in the Coutume, had not been able to make
the necessary distinction, or apply the Coutume, in
many instances desirable in cases from Lower
Canada. In many instances errors had resulted.
The two Quebec judges would be associated with
gentlemen versed in English and Canadian law,
and better acquainted with the manner of its
interpretation than members of the Privy Council
could be. Without derogating from this respected
tribunal, the Canadian court would offer more
security to us, afford greater facilities for the
settlement of appeals, and prove far less expensive
to suitors.

The next speaker was the Honourable Mr.
Campbell, from Ontario. He gave a very
balanced and impartial speech, and said that
although he fully appreciated that a young
country like Canada should wish to establish
a final Court of Appeal of its own, for his
part, as an old man he would prefer to remain
with the system with which he had grown
up-that of allowing appeals to the judges
in England. I rather wonder whether the
honourable senator from Toronto who bears
the same name, and who succeeds the honourable senator of 1875, would express the same
opinion today. The Honourable Mr. Trudel
and the Honourable Mr. Allan questioned
whether the Dominion Parliament had the
constitutional right to abolish appeals to the
45785-9

Privy Council. As an alternative to the
Supreme Court, Mr. Trudel made a suggestion
which at least had the merit of novelty.
This is what he suggested:
For his part he thought this Senate itself should
be the highest court of appeal for the people of the
dominion, just as the English House of Lords was
the highest tribunal in the British Empire. He
saw nothing in our constitution which would prevent the government from naming seven or eight
members of this Senate as a Judicial Committee
which might be vested with appellate jurisdiction.

The Honourable Mr. Bureau, from Quebec,
said that on the whole he would prefer to
trust the rights of French Canadians to the
proposed Supreme Court rather than to the
Privy Council. The Honourable Mr. Scott,
from Ontario, remarked that as there had
been only one appeal from that province to
the Privy Council in six years, the deprivation of the right of appeal to that body could
not be a very serious matter. The bill was
read a second time, without a division, and
was referred to the Committee of the Whole
for the following day, and on April 6 the
bill was considered in the Committee of the
Whole, the report of that stage being very
sketchy indeed.
The real discussion came upon the motion
for third reading. At that time the Senate
really came to grips with the question of the
abolition of appeals to the Privy Council.
On the motion for third reading a number
of amendments were moved. The first amendment was that the bill be read "this day
three months". This was defeated by a vote
of thirty-one to twenty-seven. The second
amendment was that clause 47-that is the
clause which I have been mentioning, for
the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council-be struck out of the bill. The Senate
vote on that motion resulted in a tie, twentynine senators voting in favour and twentynine senators voting against. The motion
was therefore lost, and clause 47 remained
in the bill. There were several other amendments, all of which were defeated, and the
bill finally received third reading without
amendment.
It is interesting and indeed rather amusing
to read the arguments for and against that
were advanced on this matter in the Senate
of 1875; the same arguments almost word
for word as used in the discussion today.
Let me give an example. On the one side
there was the argument that this country
should not deprive itself of the right to go
to the extremely high judicial authorities
in Great Britain. There was also what they
called the sentimental argument, what one
honourable senator referred to as "the breaking of the silken tie" which bound Canada
to Great Britain. On the other side there

SENATE
were such arguments as these: The Honourable Mr. Letellier de St. Just said that "If
this country was not able to find among its
own men those qualified to be the judges in
the last resort on cases affecting our civil
rights, we would have reason to despair of
our country", and the Honourable Mr. Scott,
from Ontario, remarked that "the people of
Ontario were almost unanimously against
appeal to England, as being altogether
unnecessary". He said "they felt that the
judges we were likely to have on that tribunal would be quite as equal in point of
ability, to give intelligent expression to our
laws, as the judges in England. Her Majesty
was quite as much represented on the
judiciary of this country as on the Supreme
Court in the city of London".
Over the intervening span of years I
salute those wise words from Mr. Letellier
de St. Just, of Quebec, and from Mr. Scott
of Ontario. I can only hope that some day
in the distant future I may be dealt with
as I have today dealt with them, and that
perhaps, let us say, in the year 2025, some
honourable senator, rising in his place in
this chamber, may quote from the Senate
debates of 1949, some pearl of wisdom from
the remarks of the former senator from
Inkerman.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I said, the parliament of 1875 fully believed that it had
abolished appeals to the Privy Council,
though I must say that it was somewhat
doubtful until the Statute of Westminster of
1931 whether our parliament had power to
abolish those appeals.
When the Act was sent over to England for
royal sanction, great exception was taken ta
section 47 by the Lord Chancellor and the
legal advisers of the Crown, and also by Lord
Carnarvon, who at that time was Colonial
Secretary in the Conservative administration
of Mr. Disraeli. Lord Carnarvon threatened
that unless section 47 was removed, the bill
would be disallowed in its entirety. There
ensued some acrimonious correspondence
between him and Mr. Edward Blake, who by
that time had succeeded Mr. Fournier as
Minister of Justice in the Canadian cabinet.
One of the arguments advanced by Lord
Carnarvon sounds rather peculiarly to our
ears today. He said that a large number of
English people had invested important sums of
money in Canada, and that for the protection
of those investments they should have the
right of final appeal to the court in England.
To that argument Mr. Blake replied, very
an
was
casting
this
that
properly,
unwarranted reflection upon the honesty of
Canadian judges.

The matter was finally settled in this way.
It was discovered that there was a flaw in
section 47. It will be remembered that that
section, as I read it to the house, says that
there shall be no appeal from the Supreme
Court of Canada to "any court of appeal
established by the Parliament of Great
Britain."
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is not a court of appeal; it is a body
of men appointed by the Crown to advise the
Crown on matters of law; it is not a court of
law but a court of prerogative. Section 47
therefore did not apply. The situation was
saved for English investors in Canada, and
appeals to the Privy Council continued as
before.
Section 47 still remains in our statutes. It is
now section 54 of our Supreme Court Act, and
it stands as a melancholy monument to an
attempt by this parliament in 1875 which
failed of its purpose. I cannot refrain from
expressing the view that it would have been
far better in every way if section 47 had
become effective and if our Supreme Court
had been from the very beginning the final
court of appeal for Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What this house is
doing today is taking up the consideration of
this matter where it was left off on the 6th
of April, 1875. If honourable senators will
look at the bill now before them they will
see that its principal purpose is to amend
section 54-formerly section 47-of the
Supreme Court Act in such a way as to make
it abundantly clear that any kind of appeal
from Canada to any court of England is now
abolished.
Now let me come to the more recent history
of this matter. It involves a leap of more
than sixty years, and brings us to the year
1938. With that period the name of one man
is inextricably associated. That man was the
late C. H. Cahan. As many honourable senators know, Mr. Cahan was a very distinguished lawyer. He had practiced both before
the Bar of his native province of Nova Scotia
and the Bar of Quebec; he had been elected
Conservative member of parliament from
the St. Lawrence-St. George division of
Montreal in 1925, and from 1930 to 1935 was
Secretary of State in the Conservative
administration headed by Mr. Bennett. In
the year 1938 Mr. Cahan was an old man. In
his young days at Halifax, in his native
province, he had known the Fathers of Confederation from that province.
May I be allowed to interject a personal
note here? At the general election of 1935
I was a candidate against Mr. Cahan for the
House of Commons constituency of St.

OCTOBER 18, 1949
Lawrence-St. George. I think I gave him a
good fight-in any event I succeeded in considerably reducing his majority-but the
electors returned him. I think they felt that
here was an old man who had done considerable work for his country and deserved well
of his fellow Canadians and was therefore
entitled to another term in the House of Commons. And viewing the matter at this period,
and after the lapse of these years, I cannot
find it in my heart to say that they were
wrong.
In the session of 1938 Mr. Cahan introduced
in the House of Commons a bill to abolish
appeals to the Privy Council. It was of
course a private member's bill-he being a
member of the opposition-and it did not get
very far; but upon the motion for second
reading there was a most interesting discussion, to which I want to refer in more
detail a little later on. The then Minister
of Justice, Mr. Lapointe, expressed strong
approval of the bill, but he voiced some slight
doubt as to the power of the federal parliament to enact legislation abolishing appeals
to the Privy Council. The same doubt, honourable senators will recall, had been
expressed in the debate in this chamber in
1875.
At the following session, in 1939, Mr. Cahan
again introduced a bill for the same purpose,
in slightly modified form. In the debate on
second reading Mr. Lapointe announced that
the government had decided to submit the
question to the Supreme Court for its opinion.
The bill was then dropped, awaiting the
Supreme Court's decision. The question was
duly submitted to the court, which in 1940
gave judgment that the Parliament of Canada
had the constitutional power to enact this
legislation. That judgment was appealed to
the Privy Council, but on account of the war
the hearing by the Privy Council was delayed.
Finally, in January 1947, the Privy Council
gave its decision, upholding the judgment of
the Supreme Court. So, in considering the
bill now before them, honourable senators
can rest perfectly satisfied that it is within
the competence of the Parliament of Canada
to enact this legislation.
To carry the story a little further: In the
sessions of 1947 and 1948 this matter was again
discussed in another place upon a motion
introduced by one of the members from
Saskatchewan. Early in the present year a
bill similar to this one was printed and circulated, but was not proceeded with owing to
the dissolution of parliament. The bill now
before us is its successor.
Honourable senators, I have spent some
time sketching the previous history of this
matter, partly because of its intrinsic interest, partly because it seems to me to form a
45785-91

necessary background for the discussion of
the problem now before us, and partly also
because it throws an interesting and, I suggest, rather amusing light on the argument
which we hear today that this bill should not
now be proceeded with, that the public is
not ready for it, and that there should be a
further delay. Well, good heavens! how much
more delay do we want? As I have said,
all the arguments for and against were made
use of in the parliament of 1875. The question has been actively before the public mind
since 1938. A bill similar in all respects to
the bill now before us was introduced by the
present government last February. It was
known and was proclaimed to be a matter
of government policy. In the general election of last June that government was
returned to office by the largest majority in
the history of this country. In the light of
these facts, I say that the argument for further delay is not only specious but absurd on
its very face.
Let me refer as briefly as I can to the
debate on the second reading of the Cahan
bill in the House of Commons in 1938. The
discussion centred very largely on the constitutional decisions given by the Privy
Council over a long period of years, and the
effect of those decisions on the respective
rights and powers of the dominion and the
provinces as laid down in sections 91 and 92
of the British North America Act. Mr.
Cahan made a most powerful speech-a
speech which, I suggest, would repay re-reading today. He claimed that the Privy Council,
in a series of decisions over a long period,
had so whittled away and cut down the
powers which the fathers of confederation
had intended to confer, and had indeed conferred, upon the Dominion parliament, as to
leave us with a constitution in which the
division of powers between the federal and
provincial authorities was completely different from that which had been agreed upon
in 1867. He charged that the Privy Council
had done this deliberately and as a matter
of policy.
The real nub and core of his complaint
against the Privy Council was that it had not,
as it should have done, confined itself as a
court of law to the interpretation of the
British North America Act as it found it;
rather, it had deliberately modified that Act
to suit what it thought the proper division of
powers between dominion and provinces
ought to be. In other words, it had acted not
as a court, but as a legislature for Canada.
In the debate that followed, the then member for Selkirk, Mr. Thorson-now Mr. Justice
Thorson, President of the Exchequer Courtfrom the Liberal benches strongly supported
the Cahan bill. He repeated the charge that

SENATE
the Privy Council had gone beyond its powers
as a court, and under the guise of interpreting
the principles of the British North America
Act had, in fact, altered that Act and frustrated the intention of the fathers of
confederation.
I think I ought to remind the Senate that
in the following year, 1939, the former Law
Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of this
house, Mr. W. F. O'Connor, K.C., pursuant
to a resolution of this house, made a report
to the Senate on the whole subject. That
report, which was printed and circulated to
all honourable senators at that time, is
entitled thus: "Report, Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate, to the honourable the
Speaker by The Parliamentary Counsel,
relating to the enactment of the British North
America Act, 1867, any lack of consonance
between its terms and judicial construction
of them and cognate matters". That was a
very detailed and voluminous report. The
important point about it is that in that report
the former Parliamentary Counsel of this
body reached exactly the same conclusion as
had been reached by Mr. Cahan and by the
present Judge Thorson. May I quote just
one short paragraph from page 13 of the
report? The Parliamentary Counsel is of
course discussing the British North Anerica
Act, and this is what he says:
For over twenty years the legislative machinery
of the Act worked well. Then it began to experience
judicial disinclination to apply its precise terms.
Ultimately, in 1896 it was repealed by judicial legislation and different legislative machinery was substituted. In these circumstances I think that not
amendment of the Act, but enforced observance of
its terms is the proper remedy.

The parliamentary counsel to the Senate
leaves no doubt at all as to whom he is
referring when he talks about "judicial legislation". He is pointing the finger at the
Privy Council, and he places the responsibility squarely upon Lord Watson, a wellknown member of the Privy Council, starting
with a judgment which that noble lord
delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee
in the Prohibition case in 1896.
These statements of Mr. Cahan, Mr. Justice
Thorson and the Law Clerk do not stand
alone. They are confirmed from a rather
surprising source-from within the Judicial
Committee itself. Honourable senators have
all heard of Lord Haldane. He was perhaps
one of the best known judges ever to sit in
the Privy Council. A former Lord Chancellor,
he sat with the Privy Council from 1910 for
nearly twenty years. He is perhaps best
remembered in this country for his decision
in the Snyder case in 1925, holding that the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act for the
peaceful settlement of industrial disputescommonly known as the Lemieux Act, which
has been in successful operation since 1907-

was ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament.
In 1899 Lord Haldane, at that time still Mr.
Haldane, Q.C., wrote an article for an English
law journal. In that article, which subsequently received considerable notoriety, he
was writing about Lord Watson, his predecessor, whom I mentioned a few minutes
ago. He discussed at some length Lord Watson's numerous judgments interpreting the
British North America Act. What Lord
Haldane had to say about Lord Watson is so
important that I crave the indulgence of the
Senate while I quote a few paragraphs from
it. This is what he says:
Lord Watson was an imperial judge of the first
order. The function of such a judge, sitting in
the supreme tribunal of the empire, is to do more
than decide what abstract and familiar legal conceptions should be applied to particular cases. His
function is to be a statesman as well as a jurist,
to fil in the gaps which parliament has deliberately
left in the skeleton constitutions and laws that it
has provided for the British colonies. The imperial
legislature has taken the view that these constitutions and laws must, if they are to be acceptable,
be in a large measure unwritten, elastic, and capable of being silently developed and even altered
as the colony develops and alters. This imposes a
task of immense importance and difficulty upon the
privy council judges, and it was this task which
Lord Watson had to face when some fifteen years
ago he found himself face to face with what
threatened to be a critical period in the history of
Canada.

What "critical period" Lord
referring to I am unaware of.

Haldane

is

He goes on:
Two views were being contended for. The one
was that, excepting in such cases as were specially provided for, a general principle ought to be
recognized which would tend to make the government at Ottawa paramount, and the governments of the provinces subordinate.
The other
was that of federalism through and through, in
executive as well as legislative concerns, whenever
the contrary had not been expressly said by the
imperial parliament.
The provincial governments naturally pressed
this latter view very strongly. The supreme court
of Canada, however, which had been established
under the Confederation Act, and was originally
intended by all parties to be the practically final
court of appeal for Canada, took the other view.
Great unrest was the result, followed by a series
of appeals to the privy couneil, which it was discovered still had power to give special leave for
them.

Now I suggest that when he talks about
"great unrest in Canada" Lord Haldane is
calling upon a very vivid imagination.

Then he goes on thus:
Lord Watson made the business of laying down
the new law, that was necessary, bis own. He
completely altered the tendency of the decisions
of the supreme court, and established in the first
place the sovereignty (subject to the power to
interfere of the imperial parliament alone) of the
legislatures of Ontario, Quebec and the other provinces.
He then worked out as a principle the
direct relation, in point of exercise of the prerogative, of the lieutenant-governors to the crown. In
a series of masterly judgments be expounded and
established the real constitution of Canada.

OCTOBER 18, 1949
Now, honourable senators, what does this
quotation mean? Lord Haldane is telling
us quite clearly that Lord Watson reinterpreted the British North America Act to
suit his own ideas of what conditions in
Canada happened to require at the time;
and Lord Haldane not only tells us that,
but he speaks of it as an admirable and
meritorious performance by Lord Watson.
There is indeed little reason to doubt that
Lord Haldane, in his own decisions in the
Privy Council interpreting the British North
America Act, followed the same practice
which he had found so admirable in Lord
Watson.
Now if this is so, we are faced with this
situation. At the present time the court of
final resort by which questions of interpretation of the British North America Act are
ultimately decided is a body of men sitting
in London, England, who claim the right to
reinterpret and, in effect, to revise our constitution in the light of what they believe
conditions in Canada may from time to time
require. These men are no doubt actuated
by the very highest of motives; but many of
them have never been in Canada in their
lives, they have no personal knowledge of
conditions in this country, and they are in
no way responsible to the people of this
dominion, or to our parliament which has no
voice in selecting them. I say that if that
is indeed the case, it is an intolerable condition of affairs, and the sooner it is ended
the better.
Now I want to be eminently fair. I know
very well that the point of view expressed
by Mr. Cahan and the others whom I have
mentioned, though very widely held, is not
held universally. There are those who believe
that the Privy Council throughout the years
has interpreted the British North America
Act strictly as it ought to be interpreted.
But whatever view one may happen to hold,
is there not this much common ground
between us? Mr. Cahan may have been
wrong, Judge Thorson may have been wrong,
our parliamentary counsel may have been
wrong, Lord Haldane may have been sadly
misunderstood in the quotation that I read
a few moments ago; nevertheless is it not
unavoidable, is it not inherent in a situation
where you have a court in one country
charged with the duty of interpreting the
highly contentious provisions of the constitution of another country thousands of
miles away, that doubt and suspicion and
recrimination are bound to arise? That these
doubts, these recriminations and these suspicions do exist, it would be idle to deny. So
far from being a link between Canada and
Great Britain, as some assert, the Privy
Council has in my view become a sore spot

and a source of dissatisfaction. I blame no
individual. No individual can be blamed.
It is the system itself that is at fault. On
that I think we can all reach common ground
of agreement. It is this defective system that
the bill now before us seeks to remove.
Now I want to refer in some little detail
to one special case which illustrates a little
further the tendency of the Privy Council to
legislate for Canada: a case first heard by
the Supreme Court and then by the Privy
Council. I think that when closely examined
it illustrates very clearly the disadvantages
and even the dangers of the present system.
It is a case of particular interest to the
Senate, because it has affected the membership of this body. I refer to the case of the
admission of women to membership of the
Senate. I refer to it also for another reason,
because it was mentioned by the honourable
lady from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)
in her speech on the Address in this bouse
a few weeks ago.
At the outset, of course, I need hardly say
that I do not question, nor is anybody in this
house questioning, the advisability of having
women in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. McLennan: I am.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The two honourable
ladies who serve in this body now are among
our most distinguished and hard-working
members, and my only complaint is that there
are not more of them.
In the year 1928 the government of the
day submitted to the Supreme Court the
question whether women were eligible to be
summoned to the Senate under the relevant
provisions of the British North America Act.
Those sections are 23 and 24, extracts of
which I will quote.
23. The qualifications of a Senator shall be as
follows:
(1) He shall be of the full age of thirty years;
(2) He shall be either a natural-born subject of
the Queen, or a subject . . . naturalized ... ;

(3) He shall be legally or equitably seised as of
freehold for his own use and benefit of lands ...
of the value of four thousand dollars, over and
above ail . . . incumbrances ... ;

(4) His real and personal property shall be
together worth four thousand dollars over and above
his debts and liabilities;
(5) He shall be resident in the province for which
he is appointed;
(6) In the case of Quebec he shall have his real
property qualification in the . . .

district that he represents.
24. The Governor General shall from time to time,
in the Queen's name, by instrument under the Great
Seal of Canada, summon qualified persons to the
Senate; and, subject to the provisions of this Act,
every person so summoned shal become and be a
Member of the Senate and a Senator.

SENATE
Now the question that was submitted for
the Supreme Court was whether, under section 24 of that Act, women were qualified
persons for admission to the Senate. The
court was a very strong one, consisting of
Chief Justice Anglin and Justices Duff, Mignault, Lamont and Smith. It decided unanimously in the negative. In a powerful judgment Chief Justice Anglin gave the court's
reasons for its decision. He said that by no
conceivable stretch of the imagination could
the Fathers of Confederation-when they
inserted the words "qualified persons" in
section 24; or the British Parliament when it
enacted the Act-have been supposed to
include women in the category of qualified
persons.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: He pointed out that in
1867 women were debarred by the Common
Law of England from holding any public
office, even down to that of church warden.
Not only could they not sit in parliament, but
they were not entitled to vote for members of
parliament. In fact, in those days many men
were deprived of the right to vote. The
right to vote was considered to be an attribute of property. The Chief Justice pointed
out that a married woman at that time could
not conceivably fulfil the property requirement of section 23, because, prior to the
enactment of the Married Women's Property
Act, a woman's property fell into the control
of her husband upon her marriage. He said
finally, and it seems to me to be the strongest
argument of all, that if the Fathers of Confederation had intended to make so radical,
so unknown a departure from a precedent as
to admit women to membership of the Senate,
they would have done it in a far different
way than by merely inserting two equivocal
words in section 24. Honourable senators, as
I have said, the decision of this strong
Supreme Court was unanimous, and I have
no hesitation in asserting that as a matter
of law, and considered solely as a matter of
strict interpretation of the British North
America Act, the Supreme Court decision was
absolutely right.
The case then went to the Privy Council,
and in 1930 the Privy Council reversed the
decision of the Supreme Court. Here again I
have no hesitation in saying that the decision
of the Privy Council was a political decision,
actuated by political motives. I use the word
"political" in its broadest sense. One can only
assume that following the precedent set by
Lord Watson and by Lord Haldane, the Privy
Council did not feel itself bound to a strict
interpretation of the British North America
Act. One can only assume that the Privy
Council decided-correctly as it turned out-

that public opinion in Canada would welcome
the admission of women to the Senate, and
was determined to torture the meaning of
the British North America Act to achieve
that end. In other words, the Privy Council
made a guess and it turned out very happily
that their guess was right. I would suggest,
however, that on other occasions they might
not guess quite so fortunately. Though we all
applaud the result, I say that the method by
which that result was achieved was most
improper. That is no way to amend the constitution of Canada.
There is a right and a proper way to
amend the British North America Act: it is
by joint address of both houses of parliament
to the British Parliament, after full and open
discussion in our parliament and in our press.
But to have it done by the Privy Council
sitting in London, which with its necessarily
limited knowledge must first decide what is
the public opinion of this country, and then
pervert the meaning of the British North
America Act to achieve the desired result. is
a wrong way and an improper way.
In seeking to justify their action in reversing
the unanimous decision of our Supreme Court,
their lordships of the Privy Council introduced an entirely new doctrine for the interpretation of the British North America Act. It
is a most interesting one, called "the doctrine
of the living tree". Let me quote from the
words of Lord Sankey, the Lord Chancellor,
when giving the decision of the Privy Council
in that case. This is what he said:
The British North America Act planted in Canada
a living tree capable of growth and expansion
within its natural limits. Like all written consti-

tutions it bas been subject to development through

usage and convention . . . The Privy Council,
indeed, bas laid down that courts of law must
treat the provisions of the British North America
Act by the same methods of construction and
exposition which have applied to other statutes.
But there are statutes and statutes. and the strict
construction deemed proper in the case, for example, of a penal or taxing statute, or one passed to
regulate the affairs of an English parish, would

be often subversive to Parliarnent's real intent if
applied to an Act passed to ensure the peace,
order and good government of a British colony.

That is the doctrine of the living tree, and
it is quite important because the very same
idea was expressed in other words as late as
1947 by the present Lord Chancellor of England, Lord Jowitt, in the decision which the
Privy Council gave in the case to which
I referred to a few minutes ago about the
abolition of appeals. Lord Jowitt said:
To such an organie statute as the British North
America Act the flexible interpretation must be
given that changing circumstances require.

Honourable senators, that is very good; it

is quite an attractive doctrine, and I am
bound to say that it seems to be the basis
upon which, say, the United States Supreme

the world has ever seen. In each of these
wars, though Britain was the first to be
involved, Canada stood by Britain's side and
bore her full share in the long and bitter
struggle to final victory. Yes, the true nature
of the tie between members of the commonwealth is a belief in the same ideals and the
same aspirations. It has little-I suggest it has
nothing-to do with mere mechanical processes of government such as we are discussing today. Indeed, I would be willing to
go further than that. I suggest to you that
the fewer of these mechanical ties that we
have between members of the commonwealth
the better will be the relations between them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We have had a very
striking example of that very recently in the
case of India. India was for many years
bound to Britain by ties which she came to
regard as a badge of servitude. As Indians
reached political maturity their protests
became more and more vigorous and eventually reached a condition bordering on
rebellion. The relations between the two
countries became as bad as could be. Ultimately, less than three years ago, the British
pulled up stakes and left India completely
free to govern herself. You tell me that the
tie of empire was broken. Yes, but what
was the result? In less than three years
India of her own free will has re-entered the
British Commonwealth of Nations, and this
very week, here in Ottawa, we are extending
a hearty welcome to the premier of that
great country as a sister nation of the
commonwealth.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Could you find in all
history a more striking example of the truth

the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life?
Now, honourable senators, I have attempted
a sketch-I am afraid too long a sketchHon. Mr. Roebuck: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -of
the historical
background on the basis of which I suggest
the Senate should consider this bill. I have
almost done, but there is one more thing
which I think I ought to say. Certain of my
remarks may have been taken to be critical
of the attitude of the Privy Council. They
may have been so, but I do not want to end
on a note of that kind. We should always
remember that ever since Canada became
a nation we have had in the Privy Council
the benefit of the experience and the wisdom
of some of the greatest legal minds in Great
Britain or, indeed, in the whole world. They
have given of that experience and of that

wisdom freely and ungrudgingly, in helping
us to solve the most important legal problems
that have arisen in this country, both those
of a private character and those of a public
and constitutional nature. That should not
be forgotten. If this bill passes, Canada's
long connection with the Privy Council will
come to a close, and I think that when it
does come to a close it would be a graceful
gesture on the part of our government if in
some formal way it expressed to the Privy
Council the thanks of Canada for the great
services which that body has rendered to
us in the past.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is a tribute which
the Privy Council well deserves, and I venture
to suggest to the leader of the government
in this house that it is a tribute which this
country is in honour bound to pay.
Honourable senators, as a Canadian of
British origin passionately interested in the
development of our country as a free, a united
and a self-reliant nation, I welcome this bill.
I believe it is a great step on our way towards
complete nationhood, and as such I welcome
it. I ask the Senate, I urge the Senate, to
pass this bill and thus complete and bring
to fruition the work begun by our predecessors in this parliament three-quarters of
a century ago.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I

Hon. Mr. Leger: I wish to speak.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
know that the motion to adjourn a debate

I wish to make. I took the liberty of suggesting that the debate be adjourned at the
conclusion of the speech by the honourable
gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), in order that some of us who are
members of a certain committee might be
released to continue work that was unfinished
this morning. I thank the honourable gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) for not
objecting to adjournment of the debate at this
time.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved second reading
of Bill N-1, an Act to incorporate the Prairie
Pipe Lines Limited.
He said: Honourable senators have heard
a good deal about bills of this nature, seek-

OCTOBER 18, 1949
ing to incorporate companies to operate
under the provisions of the Pipe Lines Act.
I need not take much time to explain this
bill, but I would like to indicate to honourable members something of its purposes.
Prior to the passing of the general Pipe
Lines Act, the sponsors of this bill incorporated in the province of Alberta a company
known as the Prairie Pipe Lines Limited. It
was proposed that the company should conduct engineering studies with respect to the
transmission and transportation of oil and
gas from the province of Alberta, to other
provinces beyond its borders and into the
international field.
After the passing of the Pipe Lines Act
the promoters found that they required
incorporation by Act of parliament. They
therefore presented a petition for incorporation to this parliament, as required, before
proceeding with their application before the
Board of Transport Commissioners.
The sponsors of the bill are Canadians;
they have completed their engineering studies
for the construction of the pipe line, and
propose to transport gas across a corner of
British Columbia, up to Trail, and through to
the coast at a point near Seattle, and thence
up to Vancouver.
The provisions of this bill are similar to
those contained in like legislation passed by
this house. The bill makes provision for the
capitalization of the company, the establishment of the head office at Calgary, the enactment of the by-laws, the general power to
construct and operate a pipe line, the power
to hold land, and contains the usual conditions. It is more or less a settled form of
bill with respect to undertakings of this
nature.
May I take a moment to anticipate some
of the questions which may arise in the minds
of honourable senators, and to clarify the
matter for them? The general legislation, as
I say, provides that a company formed for
the transmission or transportation of oil or
gas by pipe lines must be incorporated by
special Act of parliament. That is a condition precedent to anything that may be done
by any groups of individuals or company
seeking to build a pipe line.
A reference to the introduction of the Pipe
Lines bill in this chamber by the Honourable
Minister of Transport may be of interest to
honourable senators. About that time a bill
was presented to parliament asking for
authority to construct a pipe line, and at the
suggestion of the government it was withdrawn. The Honourable Minister of Transport, at page 258 of the Senate Debates of
45785-10

117

last session made the following statement
in explaining the general Pipe Lines bill in
this house:
At the last session of parliament a bill was introduced in this chamber to incorporate Western Pipe
Lines. The purpose of that bill was to incorporate
a company with power to construct and operate a
pipe line for the transmission of natural gas from
a point near Calgary to a point near Winnipeg, and
also certain other branch lines. After considerable
discussion, the bill was withdrawn by its promoters.
My officers held the view that to give private companies powers over oil and gas pipe lines crossing
from one province Into another, where no regulatory body existed to supervise the operations of such
companies, would create chaos and disorder in this
new and growing field.
Hence, the decision to
enact enabling legislation.
The government has
decided to recommend to parliament the enactment
of a public statute of general application, regulating the transportation of natural gas and oil by
means of pipe lines connecting two or more provinces, or extending beyond the limits of a province.

I refer to that statement, honourable senators, simply to indicate that the government
sponsored general legislation to determine
what companies shall be granted the right
to construct pipe lines, the area over which
the lines shall be built, the communities to
be served and all other matters which may
arise with respect to them.
A petition has been presented to this honourable house and referred to a committee,
asking that this bill and another one to
incorporate the Alberta Natural Gas Company, be not passed. Such a petition is
somewhat surprising. I should have thought
that the petitioners would have been satisfied
to appear before the committee when it was
considering this bill, and at that time make
their objections, if they had any valid objections to make, as to why the company should
not be incorporated. The petitioning company, which has already been formed, is
known as the West Coast Transmission Company Limited. That company is incorporated
but it has no rights. It is simply a promoter.
It is engaged in the promotion of a gas line,
like the other company now seeking incorporation. The passing of the bills incorporating other companies and containing the same
objectives, will in no way interfere with any
right which any existing corporation now
has; nor will it in any way prejudice the
position of any existing company when it
cornes before the Transport Board to obtain
a licence to construct a pipe line.
The general legislation contained in the
Pipe Lines Act is so drawn that the federal
body which is vested with the power to deal
with this matter has complete control over
applications for leave to construct a pipe
line. As soon as a company is formed it must,
as a condition precedent, obtain authority
from the Petroleum Natural Gas Board of
Alberta to export gas. That board controls

SENATE
the supply of gas in the province of Alberta,
so that a company, after incorporation, must
make application to the board to obtain a
permit for the export of gas to another
province. It must also obtain authority under
the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act,
which is under the administration of the
Department of Trade and Commerce.
I submit that when a petitioner comes
before this honourable chamber praying for
an Act to incorporate a company to engage
in this particular field of activity, the Senate
must consider the bona fides of the promoters,
whether or not any powers which they seek
are contrary to the public good, and whether
there is anything sinister behind the application for the legislation. It is unlikely that
similar petitions will come before this
chamber, because they involve the expenditure of large sums of money for engineering
studies and other matters in preparation for
hearings before the Board of Transport Commissioners.
During the last session of parliament bills
incorporating companies to engage in the
construction of oil and gas lines were considered somewhat hurriedly, but I do not
think there was any thought in the minds of
honourable senators that one company should
be given the exclusive right to build a line,
or that only one company should be incorporated for that purpose. I submit that this
is a matter which was well understood at

that time and is fully appreciated now, and
that we are simply providing a means of
incorporation, as required by law, for a company which wishes to build a pipe line.
A good deal of information about the promoters of this pipe line, the financial set-up
and so forth, will be available to honourable
senators when the bill is before the appropriate committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Motion to Adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we adjourn, I would inform the house
that I hope to proceed tomorrow afternoon
with the debate on the motion for second
reading of Bill 2, an Act to amend the
Supreme Court Act. It is desired that we
devote as much time as possible to that
measure until the debate has been concluded.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

APPENDIX
B.N.A. Act--Amendment-Correspondence
TEXT OF LETTER ADDRESSED BY THE PRIME
MINISTER TO THE PREMIERS OF ALL THE
PROVINCES
My dear Premier:
For some time the government has been giving
consideration to devising a satisfactory means of
removing the necessity, on every occasion on which
an amendment to the British North America Act
is required, of going through the form of having
the amendment made by the parliament of the
United Kingdom. It does not accord with the status
of Canada as a fully autonomous nation that we
should be obliged to have recourse to the parliament of another country, however close our association with that country, to determine our own affairs.
Moreover, it has been made increasingly clear to
the government that the parliament of the United
Kingdom has no desire to perpetuate the existing
anomalous situation any longer than is absolutely
necessary.
Before the recent election I stated on several
occasions that it was the view of the government
that a method should be worked out to amend our
constitution in Canada, and that any such method
should include the fullest safeguards of provincial
rights and jurisdiction, and of the use of the two
official languages and of those other rights which
are the sacred trust of our national partnership.
I stated also that it was the intention of the
government, after the election, to consult the provincial governments with a view to working out a
method of amending the constitution in Canada,
which would be satisfactory to all Canadians.
My colleagues and I recognize that the working
out of a satisfactory method of making all kinds of
amendments will not be easy, and the government
has accordingly decided to submit to our parliament,
at the forthcoming session, an address requesting
an amendment of the British North America Act by
the United Kingdom parliament which would vest
in the parliament of Canada the authority to amend
the constitution of Canada but only in relation to
matters not coming within the jurisdiction of the
legislatures of the provinces, nor affecting the rights
and privileges of the provinces, or existing constitutional rights and privileges with respect to
education and to the use of the English and French
languages.
Such an amendment would give the Canadian
parliament the same jurisdiction over the purely
federal aspects of our constitution that the provincial legislatures already possess over the provincial constitutions, while giving both to provincial
rights and jurisdiction and to the historic rights of
minorities an express assurance of legal protection
which we feel they should have.
We recognize that amendments may be required
from time to time in the national interest of those
provisions of the constitution which concern both
federal and provincial authorities, and that it would
be desirable to devise a generally satisfactory
method of making such amendments in Canada
whenever they may be required.
The federal government would appreciate the
opportunity of consulting with the governments of
all the provinces on this matter in the manner most
convenient to the provincial governments, at an
early date after the conclusion of the forthcoming
session of parliament. If the provincial governments should desire, meanwhile, to have a preparatory conference of constitutional experts, we would
be ready to have federal officials participate.
45785-10j

with Provincial Premiers

Our aim is to reach agreement, as soon as possible,
on a method of amendment which will relieve the
United Kingdom parliament of an embarrassing
obligation, and establish within Canada full and
final responsibility for all our national affairs.
To this end we are inviting the co-operation of
your government and the governments of all the
other provinces of Canada.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. St. Laurent,
I hope you will overlook the delay which has
occurred since you wrote me on September 14,
with regard to finding a suitable new procedure
for amending the British North America Act.
I was in Ottawa when you wrote, and your letter
was here when I got back. I have brought the
matter to the attention of the government of Newfoundland, and they share fully my view that we,
for our part, agree with you and your government
that a new procedure should be found. We will
be happy to co-operate with you in the endeavour.
We will be ready at any time after prorogation of
parliament to meet with you at Ottawa.
Awaiting your further advice, and with all good
wishes,
Very sincerely yours,

I thank you for the assurance of the readiness

and I shall advise you in due course of our proposals respecting a conference for the purpose.

My dear Prime Minister,
Let me acknowledge, and thank you for, your
letter of September 14 in which you deal with the
question of devising a method of amending the
British North America Act in Canada.
I note that the federal government would be
appreciative of an opportunity of consulting with

SENATE
the governments of all the provinces on this matter
at some convenient date after the conclusion of
the current session of Parliament. The government
of Nova Scotia will be glad to have a representative or representatives at any conference to be
called for consideration of this important matter.
I doubt that a preparatory conference of constitutional experts should be held before a general conference between represcntatives of the dominion
and the provinces.
I observe that the Minister of Justice has introduced a bill for the abolition of appeals to the
privy council. It seems to me that the abolition
of appeals to the privy council might well form
the subject of study by such a general conference
as is envisaged in your letter. I beg to suggest,
therefore, that final consideration of the bill now
before the House of Commons be deferred until
the conference suggested in your letter will be
held. There is, I believe, considerable support for
that view that the abolition of appeals to the Privy
council is in effect an amendment of the constitution and that, therefore, it is a question which
should be the subject of discussion at the dominionprovincial conference which you suggest.
Yours sincerely,
Angus L. Macdonald

I thank you for the assurance of the readiness of

I have duly noted your observations regarding a
preparatory conference of experts and will place
them before my colleagues when I have been
advised of the attitude of all the provincial governments.
I have discussed with my colleagues the suggestion
contained in your letter that final consideration to
the bill to abolish appeals to the privy council be
deferred until after the proposed conference between the federal and provincial governments. We
feel, however, that, since the judgment of the
privy council indicated clearly and unequivocally
that the federal parliament possesses exclusive jurisdiction to legislate respecting a final court of appeal
for Canada, it would not be an appropriate subject
for consultation with the provincial governments,
but that parliament should, without further delay,
discharge the responsibility placed upon it by the
constitution.

Please accept my best wishes.
M. L. Duplessis
Office of the Prime Minister
Province of Quebec
Quebec, 21

September 1949

Right Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa.
Mr. Prime Minister:
The members of the executive council of the
province have today considered the letter which
contains the very important constitutional changes
that you mention. This was the first cabinet meeting since your letter was delivered to my office
last Friday.
It is, I believe, not necessary to reiterate that
the present government of Quebec is in favour of
Canadian autonomy, but that it also firmly respects
the autonomy of the provinces, particularly that
of Quebec.
Quebec are always
Provincial authorities in
ready to participate in a Canadian intergovernmental conference seeking to study beforehand
and apply subsequently the most appropriate and
most just methods to give effect to the rights,
prerogatives and liberties of the central authority,
as well as the provincial authorities.
You write that your colleagues and yourself
recognize that it will not be easy to find a satisfactory and general method of amending the
constitution.
Evidently the many problems with which we
would be confronted in amending our constitution
require study and an appropriate delay, and also
the co-operation of all the interested parties, that
is to say, the governments of the provinces and of
the country.
The Canadian constitution is not the work of
an hour, nor is it the realization of hasty decision
nor the realization of a single political party or
single government. It seems to me that each and
every one of us can profit by the example given
to us by the fathers of confederation, who let the
project ripen, and obtained, before deciding anything, the opinion and approbation of the administrations as well as of the statesmen of the time
belonging to different parties, different races and
different religions.
The government of Quebec, in accord with the
highest constitutional and political authorities,
without distinction as to race or party, is of the
opinion that the British North America Act is a
pact concluded between the four pioneer provinces, Lower and Upper Canada (Quebec and
Ontario), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
We share also the opinion expressed by the Hon.
Honore Mercier, former premier of the province
of Quebec, who declared, as did many other Canadian statesmen: "The existence of the provinces
preceded that of the dominion; it is from them
that it received its powers. They are sovereign
within the limits of their attributions, and any
interference with this sovereignty is a violation
of the federal pact."
From this it follows that it is necessary that
amendments which are to be proposed to the
Canadian constitution should be submitted. initially
for the consideration and approbation of the provinces which gave birth to the central authority.
You declare in your letter that your government
has decided to submit to the federal parliament at
the present session an address praying the parliament of the United Kingdom to confer upon the

parliament of Canada the right to amend the constitution of Canada, but only in relation to matters
not coming within the jurisdiction of the legislatures of the provinces, nor affecting the constitutional rights and privileges of the provinces, nor
the existing rights and privileges in the matter of
education or relating to the use of the French
and English languages.
Do you not think that it would be arbitrary on
the part of the federal government to decide
ex parte and of its own authority which are
federal rights and which are the rights of the
provinces? It seems clear to us that it does not
belong to one of the parties to a multilateral
contract to declare itself the supreme arbitrator
in the interpretation of this contract and to assume
of its sole authority rights which profoundly concern the other contracting parties.
Do you not think that such an attitude would
be incompatible with Canadian unity, well understood, detrimental to desirable Canadian co-operation and contrary to the true interests of the
country?
In our opinion the Canadian constitution is a
pact which cannot be amended in a unilateral
fashion. We believe that an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure and it is appropriate
that the provinces should be consulted beforehand
rather than be left in the presence of an accomplished fact.
We therefore ask, Mr. Prime Minister, that you
delay all legisIation relating to the federated pact
and call together in the first place the interested
parties in order that they may study together in
a spirit of co-operation the vital problems which
are connected with all amendments to the British
North America Act.
Please accept my good wishes

Office of the Prime Minister
Canada
Ottawa September 28, 1949
The Honourable Maurice
Premier of Quebec,
Parliament Buildings,
Quebec, Que.

Duplessis,

M.L.A.,

My dear Premier:
I duly received your letter of the 21st September,
in which you set out the attitude of your government
respecting
the
constitutional
proposals
referred to in my letter of September 14.
I am pleased that you have said that the provincial authorities of Quebec are ready to participate
at any time in a conference between the various
Canadian governments with the object of examining and applying the right and proper methods of
giving effect to the rights, prerogatives and liberties of the central authority and the provincial
authorities.
I note also that you reiterate the opinion that
the British North America Act is a compact entered
into by the four original provinces. Without at
this time entering Into any debate regarding this
opinion or the consequences which flow from it,
I would simply recall that historically the federal
authorities have always proceeded, when there was.
a question of making amendments to this act which
touched exclusively on something within federal
jurisdiction, by taking it for granted that thosesections at least of the act do not have the character of a contract, but are rather statutory provisions capable of being amended by the legislative
authority which enacted them.
In the present circumstances we do not ask
anyone else to renounce a contrary opinion, but
we believe we should proceed in the same fashion

SENATE
as has been done in the past. We believe that
there is a fine of demarcation (and that it makes
very little difference whether this demarcation was
by contract or by statute as long as it is respected)
between what is exclusively in the fedelal demain,
what is exclusively in the provincial domain, and
what is of concern both to the federal and provincial authorities.
I stated in the House of Commons the other day
that it was my personal opinion that it would be
arbitrary for us to attempt to decide ourselves in
a definitive way what was on one side and what
was on the other side of this line of demarcation,
and that I believed it was desirable, when transferring from the parliament of Westminster to the
parliament of Canada the right to make amendments respecting matters which were exclusively
of federal interest, that we should use language
which would leave to the courts in case of dispute
the task of determining the line of demarcation.
We do not ask you to renounce the opinion that
you express in your letter, but we do not believe
that you will expect us to renounce the one which
bas been constantly followed in practice in securing
the different amendments which have been made
to the British North America Act between 1871
and 1949.
I believe that what we suggest offers a practical
means of achieving something without either of
us on one side or the other having to acquiesce in
an opinion that he does not feel he should admit.
The provinces have always had the right of
amending their constitution except as respects the
office of lieutenant governor. As for the federal
authorities, every time they have considered it
advisable to amend the provisions which concern
them exclusively-and that has seemed advisable
about ten times since 1867-they have had to have
the amendment made
by the parliament of
Westminster.
When we have secured for the federal parliament
the right to make these amendments instead of
having only the right to have them made at Westminster at the request of our two houses of parliament, the problem will remain of providing for
amendments, if any should ever be necessary, to
the provisions which are not subject to amendment
either by the federal parliament alone or by the
provincial legislatures alone.
What we wish to examine with the provincial
governments is what would be the right and proper
procedure in this respect, and we wish at the same
time to make provision in the constitution for
express guarantees for the autonomy of the provinces, both with respect to their jurisdiction and
to their rights and privileges, as well as for the
rights and privileges with respect to education and
the use of the French and English languages.
It is our hope that, subject to any reservations
you may consider proper, your government will
take part in such a conference.
Yours sincerely,
Louis S. St. Laurent
Office of the Premier
Province of Quebec
October 5, 1949
Right Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa.
Mr. Prime Minister:
At the first meeting of council, held today, I
submitted your letter of the 28th of September
regarding constitutional changes which you have
of my
consideration
the
for
recommended,
colleagues.
"I would simply recall that hisYou write:
torically the federal authorities have always pro-

ceeded, when there was a question of making
amendments to this act which touched exclusively
on something within federal jurisdiction, by taking
it for granted that those sections at least of the
act do not have the character of a contract, but
are rather statutory provisions capable of being
amended
by the legislative
authority which
enacted them".
Permit me respectfully to recall to you that your
interpretation does not correspond with that of
the fathers of the federative pact in the parliament
of Westminster in 1867. Lord Carnarvon in the
House of Lords, and the Under-Secretary of State
for the Colonies, Mr. Adderley in the House of
Commons, have said as follows:
Lord Carnarvon: "The Quebec resolutions, with
some slight changes, form the basis of a measure
that I have now the honour to submit to parliament. To those resolutions all the British provinces in North America were, as I have said, consenting parties, and the measure founded upon
them must be accepted as a treaty of union."
Mr. Adderley:
"If, again, federation bas in this
case specially been a matter of most delicate
treaty and compact between the provinces . . . it is
clearly necessary that there should be a third
party ab extra to give sanction to the treaty made
between them."
It seems evident to us that Lord Carnarvon and
Mr. Adderley were fully aware of what they were
discussing, that they were acting in good faith, and
that they did not wish to mislead those who were
interested, by statements which were not correct.
In addition, our Canadian statesmen of different
political allegiances and different races have also
expressed on several occasions the opinion that
the act of confederation is a pact or a treaty.
We are persuaded that if the province of Quebec
had believed that the federative act represented
simply a piece of legislation always susceptible of
being amended at the sole wish of the federal
authorities, it would not have given its consent.
It seems clear to us that at the moment of confederation the statesmen of the time had in mind
and sought confirmation of a pact or treaty.
Further, there are several privy council judgments
to the effect that not a law but a pact is involved.
If, as you have written, and once more, we
respect your opinion without sharing it, the Canadian constitution is a law which does not offer
guarantees of permanence and stability as such,
because it is subject to all modifications, how
would a new law, also subject to amendments,
offer greater guarantees?
Do you not believe that the many vital problems
involved in an amendment of the Canadian constitution are of such magnitude that it is fitting
that they be studied and given mature consideration, before proposing them, and even more before
adopting them?
Yeu invoke federal precedents for the proposed
method of amending the constitution. Do you not
believe that bad precedents ought net to be multiplied-and moreover, none of the precedents to
which you have referred has the importance nor
is so far-reaching as what you now propose. We
must not forget that very important amendments
constitution, though not as
to the Canadian
important as those which you propose, have been
made despite the opposition of the province of
In our opinion the more numerous the
Quebec.
bad precedents are, the more necessary it is to
put an end to them and to cease multiplying them.
I repeat that the present government of Quebec
is in faveur of the autonomy of Canada, but that
it also holds firmly to respect for the autonomy of
the provinces and of Quebec in particular.
I should like to renew the assurances that the
provincial authorities in Quebec are always ready
to take part in a Canadian intergovernmental con-

OCTOBER 18, 1949
ference whose aim would be to study beforehand
and apply subsequently the most appropriate and
just methods to give effect to the rights, prerogatives, and liberties of the central authority as well
as of the provincial authorities.
Once more I draw your attention to the fact that
the Canadian constitution did not result from hasty
decisions, nor was it the realization of a single
political party or of a single government.
We renew our request, Mr. Prime Minister, that
you agree to postpone all legislation concerning
the federative pact and call together initialy the
interested parties to study together in a spirit of
co-operation the vital problems involved in an
amendment to the British North America Act.

M. L. Duplessis
Office of the Prime Minister

The Honourable Maurice Duplessis, M.L.A.
Premier of Quebec,
Parliament Buildings,
Quebec, Que.
My dear Premier:
I duly received your letter of the 5th instant with
further reference to the constitutional changes proposed by the federal government, and I submitted it
to my colleagues yesterday.
In your letter we were surprised to read the
following paragraph:
"If, as you have written, and once more we
respect your opinion without sharing it, the Canadian constitution is a law which does not offer
guarantees of permanence and stability as such, because it is subject to all modifications, how would a
new law, also subject ta amendments, offer greater
guarantees?"
That is not the position of the federal government at all. We do not claim, and have never
claimed, that the federal authorities have any such
sweeping right in respect to amendments to the
constitution.
What we do claim, and what we propose to secure
at the present time, is a practical method of having
made in Canada, by the federal parliament alone,
not "all amendments" to the constitution, but only
amendments relating to provisions of the constitution which are the exclusive concern of the federal
authorities.
We believe we already have the right to have
such amendments made without consulting the provincial authorities, just as the provincial legislatures
have the right, without consulting the federal
authorities, to make themselves, any amendments
they consider desirable of those provisions which
concern them exclusively.
In order to secure a declaration that such amendments can be made by the federal parliament instead
of having them made by the parliament at Westminster, we propose to use the procedure used in
securing amendments in the past.
The amendments already made within the federal
sphere have had beneficial results, notably those
of 1943 and 1946, which assured to the population of
Quebec a more equitable representation in the
federal parliament.
In your opinion this procedure and these precedents are unsound. To that opinion we can only
reply that "we respect your opinion without sharing
it," and that, as in the past, there is no obligation
to ask for your consent or your acquiescence.
We now believe that a change of venue for future
amendments is desirable. We believe that, rather
than have them made by a parliament representing
the citizens of the United Kingdom, future amendments to our constitution should, depending upon
the subject matter of the amendment, either be

made by parliament alone or parliament and the
legislatures, which represent the citizens of Canada.
There is no doubt about our power to have this
change of venue made without consulting the provincial authorities and without their acquiescence,
"except as regards matters coming within the
classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively
to the legislatures of the provinces, or as regards
rights or privileges by this or any other constitutional act granted or secured to the legislature or
the government of a province, or to any class of
persons with respect to schools or as regards the use
of the English or the French language."
We claim we also have the right to have this
change of venue made, without the consent or
acquiescence of the provincial authorities. We cannot therefore accede to your request to postpone all
action until there has been an understanding with
the provincial authorities.
Once this first step has been taken, the federal
authorities will be in the same position as the provincial authorities. If, under the pretence of making
an amendment to the provincial constitution, a legislature encroaches on matters coming under federal
jurisdiction, the courts would declare such an
amendment ultra vires. The same rule will apply
to federal legislation: to be valid, it will have to
avoid encroaching on matters assigned exclusively
to the provincial legislatures, or on rights or privileges granted or secured to the legislature or government of a province or to any class of persons with
respect to schools, or as regards the use of the
English or French language. If ever there should be
legal disputes as to the validity of such federal
legislation, the courts would be called on to decide
them.
But there will remain, as I stated in my letter of
the 28th of September, the problem "of providing
for amendments, if any should ever be necessary,
to the provisions which are not subject to amendment either by the federal parliament alone or by
the provincial legislatures alone".
So long as the federal and provincial authorities
have not agreed upon a right and proper procedure
in this respect, ail such amendments will remain
within the jurisdiction of the parliament in London,
instead of here in Canada.
There will also remain the problem of embodying
in the constitution express legal safeguards of the
rights of the provinces and of minorities which are
not there now. All these things can be done, and
we believe they should have done, and, when we
of the federal government have accomplished all
that we believe we can have done by ourselves, I
shall renew the invitation to you to confer with us
and representatives of the other provincial governments in order to devise means of completing the
task of having transferred to the Canadian authorities what remains of the jurisdiction of the parliament in London over Canada's domestic affairs.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I have your letter of the 14th September relative
to the amendment of our constitution. I shall be
glad to attend the conference which you refer to,
and which it is proposed to hold shortly after the
present session of parliament.
I agree with your observation that the working
out of a satisfactory method of making all kinds
of amendments to the constitution will not be easy.
I can assure you that we are prepared to give all
proposals the utmost consideration. I am frankly

SENATE
in some doubt as to the advisability of dealing
with the matter piecemeal without first attempting
general agreement. Obviously, matters which are
purely a federal concern will have to be delineated
from time to time by the courts. My consideration
of the matter leads me to believe that abolition of
appeals to the privy council may affect this very
important side of matters more than is generally
realized. Following my conversation with you the
other day, Mr. Garson wrote to me and I expressed
some of my doubt in the matter in a letter under
yesterday's date.
I make these observations because of the difficulties which were inherent in this whole matter.
As stated, I shall attend the conference and, if it
should appear desirable to have a preparatory
conference of constitutional experts, we shall be
prepared to participate.
Very sincerely yours,
Leslie M. Frost

Premier of Ontario,

Toronto, Ontario.
My dear Premier:
I have just this afternoon received your letter
of the 7th instant, replying to mine of the 14th
of September, relative to the amendment of our
constitution.
As I am obliged to leave Ottawa in a few minutes
and wiil be absent for two or three days, I am
sending this acknowledgment at once and confining
myself to expressing appreciation of your expression
of the willingness of the Ontario government to
participate in a conference to consider a suitable
method of amending the constitution in Canada.
Yours sincerely,

The Right Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent, K.C.,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa, Canada.
My dear Prime Minister:
I am in receipt of your letter of September 14,
1949.
The government of Manitoba would be pleased
to discuss with the federal government and the
governments of the several provinces the questions
mentioned by you at any time and place that is
mutually convenient.
Your letter indicates that your government has
aiready decided to ask the United Kingdom parliament to amend the British North America Act so
that the parliament of Canada would have authorIty to amend the constitution of Canada, but only
in relation to matters not coming within the jurisdiction of the legislatures of the provinces nor
affecting the rights and privileges with respect to
education and to the use of the English and French
languages. The governrment of Manitoba feels that
there might be differences of opinion as to whether
a proposed amendment to the constitution related
only to federal matters or affected provincial Inter-

ests, rights, or jurisdiction. Before agreeing to
any specific proposal, therefore, our government
will examine carefully the manner in which the
provincial position is to be protected.
The main purpose of the conference, as I understand it, would be to try to evolve a method of
making, within Canada, amendments to those provisions of the constitution which concern both
federal and provincial governments. The government of Manitoba realizes that a conference such
as this will be dealing with difficult and complex
constitutional problems, and that progress towards
a solution of them can be made by representatives
of Canada and the provinces meeting together.
Our government is therefore of the opinion that a
preliminary conference, comprising constitutional
experts, though not necessarily limited to them,
would be useful in clarifying many of the issues
involved.
We would consequently welcome the
calling of such a preparatory conference and will
be glad to participate in it.
I assume that the Manitoba government will be
furnished with an agenda for either the preparatory conference or a dominion-provincial conference in sufficient time to afford us an opportunity
of discussing items on the agenda and to enable
our representatives te make full preparations.
Yours sincerely,
Douglas Campbell
Office of the Prime Minister

Honourable Douglas Campbell, M.L.A.,
Premier of Manitoba,
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
My dear Premier:
I wish to acknowledge your letter of the 6th
instant regarding the proposed consultation with
the provincial governments with regard to the
procedure for amending the constitution.
I thank you for the assurance of the readiness
of the government of Manitoba te participate In
a conference for this purpose, and I shall advise
you in due course of our proposals in that connection. As to a preparatory conference of experts,
the government is awaiting word as te the attitude
of all the provincial governments before deciding
whether it would be helpful for us to take any
initiative in arranging such a meeting.
As for the amendment we have already decided
to ask the United Kingdom parliament to enact,
I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the motion
which is already on the order paper of the House
of Commons. Since it relates only to that part
of the constitution which is of exclusive concern
to the federal authorities, and leaves to the courts
the responsibility for deciding any disputes as to
the limits of our jurisdiction, it was our view that
it would not be appropriate to consult the provincial authorities or to ask them to share our
responsibility for a proposal which relates exclusively to matters within federal jurisdiction.
Yours sincerely,
Louis S. St. Laurent
Premier's Office
Regina, September 20th, 1949
Right Hon. L. S. St. Laurent,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
My dear Prime Minister:
Thank you for your letter of September 14
advising me that at the forthcoming session you

OCTOBER 18, 1949
propose to take steps to secure an amendment
to the British North America Act vesting the parliament of Canada with the authority to amend the
constitution of Canada in relation to matters not
coming within the jurisdiction of the provinces nor
affecting minority rights.
The government of Saskatchewan has always held
that Canada should have the right to amend its own
constitution, and consequently we welcome the
news that steps are being taken to this end in so far
as purely federal matters are concerned. I would
take it that this will be done in conjunction with
the abolition of appeals to the judicial committee
of the privy council; for it would seem anomalous
to vest the Canadian parliament with the authority
to amend its constitution and leave with a judicial
body of the United Kingdom power to hand down
decisions affecting the interpretation of Canadian
law. If such a step is taken, may I respectfully
suggest that some measures should be adopted to
make the Canadian supreme court more representative than it is at present, in order that those who
find it necessary to appeal decisions of the lower
courts may feel more confident than they are at
present that these matters are being approached
from the broadest possible viewpoint.
With reference to your suggestion that the federal
and provincial governments consult at an early date
regarding amendments which may be required to
deal with those provisions of the constitution which
affect federal and provincial authorities and minority
rights, I wish to assure you that the government
of Saskatchewan will gladly co-operate with your
government and the governments of the other
provinces in seeking to find a satisfactory solution
to this problem. We recognize that proper safeguards will be necessary in order to prevent any
upon provincial or
unwarranted
infringement
minority rights, but at the same time we are convinced that the power to amend these provisions
of our constitution should lie solely with the people
of Canada through their elected dominion and
provincial representatives. We are equally certain
that If this problem is tackled in a spirit of
co-operation and good will, a modus operandi can be
worked out which will be acceptable to the great
majority of Canadian citizens.
Will you please advise us when such a conference
is likely to be held, and if it is your intention to
invite the provincial governments to send constitutional experts to a preparatory conference for
the purpose of laying a basis for our discussions.
Assuring you of our willingness to co-operate in
ibis matter, and awaiting any further particulars
regarding the proposed conference, I remain,
Yours sincerely,
T. C. Douglas
Office of the Prime Minister
Ottawa, September 26, 1949.
Honourable T. C. Douglas, M.L.A.,
Premier of Saskatchewan,
Regina, Saskatchewan.
My dear Premier:
I wish to acknowledge your letter of the 20th
instant regarding the proposed consultation with
the provincial governments with regard to the
procedure for amending the constitution.
I thank you for the assurance of the readiness
of the government of Saskatchewan ta participate
in a conference for this purpose, and I shall advise
you in due course of our proposals In that
connection.

As to a preparatory conference of experts, the
government is awaiting word as to the attitude of
all the provincial governments before deciding
whether it would be helpful for us to take any
initiative in arranging such a meeting.
Yours sincerely,
Louis S. St. Laurent
Office of the Premier
Alberta
Edmonton,
October 12, 1949
Right Hon. Louis St. Laurent,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
My dear Prime Minister:
My colleagues and I have carefully considered
your letter of September 14, in which you invite
the co-operation of the Alberta government in
measures designed to alter the present procedure
in the matter of amendments ta the British North
America Act.
The government of Alberta will be pleased to
be represented at a conference between the dominion and the provinces for a full discussion of this
important subject. Your suggestion that such a
conference be held following the present session
of parliament is satisfactory to us.
In view of the important legal aspects of the
matter, we favour your further suggestion that a
experts
meeting of constitutional
preliminary
representing the various governments be held
prior to the main conference.
I would like to refer particularly to your observation that it is the intention of parliament at the
present session to request an amendment to the
British North America Act by the United Kingdom
parliament which would vest in the parliament
of Canada the authority to amend the constitution
of Canada in relation to matters not coming within
the jurisdiction of the legislatures of the provinces.
While ibis may appear to be a matter of concern
only to the dominion government, my colleagues
and I feel strongly that the amendment proposed
concerns the provinces as well, in that federal
policies initiated under future amendments to the
B.N.A. Act which the dominion parliament might
make within its constitutional sphere, could well
have far-reachng effects on the economy of the
provinces. Furthermore, the privy council bas
held that under the B.N.A. Act all powers have
been vested in either the provinces or the dominion.
It is difficult, therefore, to see how a situation
could arise where any amendment to the B.N.A.
Act would affect dominion powers alone, without
at the same time affecting at least to some degree
the rights of the provinces. We feel it is extremely
important, before any amendment is made to the
British North America Act, even in the field of
federal jurisdiction, that the whole question of
dominion versus provincial jurisdiction be fully
discussed at a joint meeting of representatives of
the dominion and provincial governments. We
strongly urge that this whole matter be held in
abeyance pending the conference which you propose to convene at the close of the present session
of parliament. It seems to us that this is the only
way in which future conflict can be avoided and
the unity of Canada, which we alI desire, preserved
and strengthened.
Yours very truly,
Ernest C. Manning,
Premier.

SENATE
Office of the Prime Minister
October 17, 1949
Honourable E. C. Manning, M.L.A.,
Premier of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alberta.
My dear Premier:
I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of
October 12 regarding the proposed consultations
with the provincial governments in connection
with the procedure for amending the constitution.
I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the
motion which is on the order paper of the House
of Commons embodying the address asking the
United Kingdom parliament to empower the parliament of Canada to amend our constitution in relation to matters not coming within the jurisdiction
of the legislatures of the provinces, or in relation
to provincial or minority rights. As you will see
from the motion, the proposed amendment is not
intended te affect provincial jurisdiction or the
rights or prerogatives of provincial legislatures or
governments, but relates only to that part of the
constitution which is of exclusive concern to the
federal authorities, and leaves to the courts the
responsibility for deciding any disputes as to the
limits of our jurisdiction.
In other words, the action proposed immediately
will merely give to the federal authorities the same
power to amend the constitution of Canada which
the provincial authorities already enjoy under
section 92 of the British North America Act to
amend the constitutions of the provinces.
It is accordingly our view that it would not be
appropriate to consult the provincial authorities
or to ask them to share our responsibility for a
proposal which relates exclusively to matters within
federal jurisdiction.
All that is really involved is a change of venue
for future amendments relating to provisions of
the constitution which are the exclusive concern of
the federal authorities. Since we are convinced we
have the right to have this change of venue made
without the consent or acquiescence of the provincial authorities, we feel we cannot accede to your
request that the whole matter be held in abeyance
pending the conference proposed after the close of
the present session of parliament.
Once this initial step has been taken, there will
remain the problerm of providing for amendments,
if any should ever be necessary, to the provisions
which are not subject to amendment either by the
federal parliament alone or by the provincial legislatures alone.
So long as the federal and provincial authorities
have not agreed upon a right and proper procedure
in this respect, all such amendments will remain
within the jurisdiction of the parliament in London
instead of here in Canada.
There will also remain the problem of embodying
in the constitution express legal safeguards ef the
rights of the provinces and of minorities which are
not there now. All these things can be done, and
we believe they should be done, and when, we of
the federal government have accomplished all that
we believe we can have dono by ourselves, I shall
renew the invitation to you to confer with us and
representatives of the other provincial governments
in order to devise means of completing the task

of having transferred to the Canadian authorities
what remains of the jurisdiction of the parliament
in London over Canada's domestic affairs. In this
connection my colleagues and I are gratified by
your assurance that the government of Alberta
will be pleased to be represented at such a conference.

My dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I have for acknowledgment your letter of September 14, which arrived during my absence on a trip
through the northern part of the province. I note
your desire to have a conference of representatives
of your government and the provincial governments
to discuss the possibility of amending the British
North America Act.
I may say that the government of the province of
British Columbia is willing to participate in a conference to discuss constitutional matters at a time
to be designated by your government.
We feel that the question of a preparatory conference of constitutional experts should be held in
abeyance until such time as the conference suggested has been held and an opportunity given to
the provincial governments to study in detail the
changes which may be considered desirable.
With kindest personal regards,
Yours faithfully,

Hon. John T. Haig, Acting Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
and moved concurrence in the committee's
reports numbers 90 to 101.
He said: Honourable senators, I am not
going to refer to a discussion that was had in
another place, but there is one remark that
I wish to make. I should first point out that
the Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) unfortunately is not here, and that
I have not consulted him or any other member of the committee as to what I am about
to say. It is simply this, that if honourable
members of another place desire to take the
primary evidence in divorce cases and send
the typewritten transcripts over to us with
their findings, we shall be delighted to have
them do this.
Some hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I say that quite candidly.
The motion was agreed to.

the following bills:
Bill Y-2, an Act for the relief of Marion

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved second reading
of Bill A-2, an Act respecting the incorporation of Pure-Bred Live Stock Record Associations.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, this bill, as its title indicates, relates to
the incorporation of associations for the purpose of keeping a record and maintaining a
registration of pure-bred live stock. I have
just heard a whispered comment as to why
a Toronto lawyer should explain a bill of this
nature. I may say that a similar bill was
before this house last year. It received first
reading, and on the motion for second reading I explained the principle of the measure,
whereupon it was read the second time and
was referred to a committee Upon being
reported back by the committee, the bill
was read a third time and passed, and was
sent to the other place; but time ran out
before it could receive consideration there.
Hence, I am now going to attempt to make
the same explanation I made last session.

SENATE
The principle behind this bill, of providing
for the recording of pedigrees of animals, is
not new in our legislation. The present Act
was passed in 1932. Prior to that time, and
back as far as 1900, there was a series of
statutes dealing with the subject. Before this
bill was prepared for submission to parliament, an invitation was sent out to all
breeders' associations in Canada to meet in
Ottawa for the purpose of considering the
proposed measure. There was a very large
attendance of members from the various
associations across Canada. They spent two
days reviewing and discussing the terms
of the bill, to which they gave unanimous
approval; and no protest has since been
received by the department from any association or from individual members.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Have you considered the
constitutional aspect of it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That question was raised
in committee last year. If there is any desire
to debate the question of constitutionality
perhaps the discussion could take place in
committee. Last year when the question was
raised the committee seemed to be satisfied
that the bill was within the legislative powers
of the government; and for that reason, unless
the question is raised and discussed by other
members of the Senate, I do not propose to
offer any justification on the constitutional
aspect.
What I want to point out, rather, is that
the scheme of the bill follows generally that
of the preceding legislation. A group of persons who let us say, represent breeders of a
certain class of animals can get together,
complete the form provided for in the
statute, and forward their application and the
supporting material to the Minister of Agriculture. If the minister is satisfied that the
applicants represent a cross-section of the
breeders of the particular class of animals
concerned, he will sanction the incorporation
of their association, which then becomes the
representative association for that class or
breed of animals. The association is represented on the central recording body at
Ottawa, through which the registrations are
effected; and these must be made in accordance with the regulations which the association, once it has been incorporated, will enact.
The minister retains the power to see to it
that the bylaws and regulations passed by
the incorporated association are in the form
prescribed by the Act. Until he has approved
of them they are not effective.
In one particular the bill goes a little further than any previous legislation. The purpose, I suppose, is to deal with that particular
frailty of human nature to which I referred
last year. In many cases the management

of these associations is in the hands of persons who are also exhibitors, some of whom,
in their desire to gain the top place at showings, might seek to eliminate a competitor
by invoking some bylaw of the association.
In fact, this has been done from time to time.
A member of the association who is also an
exhibitor may have made himself subject to
disciplinary action because of some conduct,
or misconduct, having no relation at all to
registration or to the identification of animals: yet some of these associations, or some
directors of associations, have seen fit to apply
a penalty preventing the person so penalized
from showing for a certain period and from
registering the progeny of his animals. Complaints on this ground have been received
from time to time by the minister. To meet
this situation a provision, subsection 5 of
section 6, which also appeared in the bill
last year, provides in effect that the right of
registration cannot be suspended unless the
person involved has been guilty of some
offence in relation to registration or the
falsification of records. That seems to be a
reasonable position to take. The form which
is used to take care of bylaws which may
presently be in existence in many associations,
and which would give that arbitrary power
that I have mentioned, is found in subsection
5 of section 6, which reads as follows:
Notwithstanding anything in the by-laws of an
association incorporated under this or any other Act
mentioned in paragraph (b) of section two, no
person shall be deprived of the right to register or
transfer pure-bred live stock unless he has violated
or is reasonably suspected by an association to have
violated
(a) a by-law of an association relating to eligibility for registration, establishment of production
credentials or payment of fees,

Then we come to sections 16 and 17, which
are penal sections dealing with the falsification of records and the making of misrepre-

sentations with respect to the quality of particular animals by holding them out to be

qualified under the records provisions in this
Act. The penal sections in this bill have
been spelled out considerably more than in
the present Act. I think that this is highly
desirable, because if we provide penalties
for offences, the various offences should be
specifically set out. At the end of the bill
there is an exception which makes section
1142 of the Criminal Code inapplicable to
proceedings with respect to the penal sections
of this measure. There is nothing mysterious
about this. When an information is laid under
section 1142 of the Criminal Code, it must be
in relation to an offence which has occurred

within six months of the laying of the information. It would be almost impossible to
discover many of the offences created under
this bill, or which exist under the present
Act, within a period of six months. It is

OCTOBER 19, 1949
therefore felt that this section of the Code
should not apply. If there should be a
fraudulent act in connection with a registration, it would be more than six months before
the facts could be obtained.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any limitation
provided in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, there is no limitation. Just to illustrate a typical offence, I
shall read part of paragraph (1) of section 17:
Every person who
(a) knowingly signs or presents, or causes or procures to be signed or presented, to the recording
officer of an association or to the person in charge
of the Canadian National Live Stock Records, any
declaration or any application for registration or
any transfer of ownership respecting any animal,
containing any material false statement or representation-

such a person is guilty of an offence and is
liable on summary conviction to a fine of not
more than $500 and not less than $50, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
months. There is a whole list of offences of
this type, and they all involve the deliberate
commission of some act. A person must
intend to do what he does. In other words,
no specific offence is created where the intention of the person who is likely to be charged
becomes unimportant, as is the case in other
classes of legislation.
I do not think it is necessary to give any
more detail about this bill. I am sure that a
great many honourable senators are thoroughly familiar with the operation of the
present statute and know its provisions much
better than I do. If the bill is given second
reading, I propose to move that it be referred
to the appropriate committee of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 2,
an Act to amend the Supreme Court Act.
(Translation):
Hon. Paul Henri Bouffard: Honourable
senators, it is with the deepest joy and the
most legitimate pride that I rise to speak on
an Act which marks a milestone in the history
of our political evolution. The Canadian

nation is taking a most important step
towards that sovereignty which is the innate
desire of all those Canadians who are proud
of their country's past, anxious for its present
and confident in its future.
I am truly happy to have the honour of
being among those who will vote for this Act,
because it means the disappearance from the
Canadian nation of one of the main relics of
a dependence inconsistent with Canada's
present greatness, its political, industrial and
commercial development, the place it has
made for itself in the world or the pride of
its people.
This Act is the result of an evolution which
started more than a century ago and to the
shaping of which all Canadian citizens of
every descent have contributed with such
firmness.
The political struggles of Canadians have
not been in vain. The year 1848 saw the
victory of responsible government, one of
the greatest which our forefathers won,
and also one of the best examples of their
tenacity.
In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed
for Canada by a Canadian. The Imperial
conferences held from 1926 to 1931 resulted
in the Statute of Westminster, which made
foreign laws inapplicable to Canada and
which gave our country full legislative
authority, territorially and extra-territorially.
Canada has shown herself worthy of the
nationhood which was granted to her. If, at
each one of these stages, some Canadians
have hesitated to face the new responsibilities
which the Canadian nation was taking upon
itself, experience has shown, over the years,
that these fears were unfounded, that the
nation was ready to take on its responsibilities and that our statesmen were well able
to guide the country towards a future which
has proved greater than any Canadian had
dared to hope.
This reluctance was inspired, not so much
by the idea of Canadian independence, which
everybody favoured in principle, but rather
by a certain fear that it might lead us to
break away from the Old Country. That has
not been the case. On the contrary, the more
independent Canadians become, the more do
they behave as loyal subjects of the King.
What Canadians want is the autonomy to
which they are entitled, the right to direct
their own affairs and to lead the nation
according to the ideas of Canadians. Who
would dare to claim that Canada's participation in the wars of 1914-1918 and 1939-1945
would have been as great, had it not been the
result of Canada's real freedom of action?

ent provinces attended. In 1945, the legislation took the form of a bill introduced in the
Canadian Parliament. During the first session of 1949, another bill was presented to
parliament and the only reason for its not
being discussed was that the session was
interrupted by the elections. Finally, in 1949,
the legislation was presented to the people
of Canada as part of the program of the
honourable Louis St-Laurent, on whom the
people seem ýto have conferred a mandate
which leaves no room for discussion.
Can anyone seriously maintain that this
legislation is too new? May I quote the words

There are two law systems in Canada: the
unwritten law, called the Common Law, in
force in nine provinces, and the written law
in force in the province of Quebec. The two
systems are essentially different. In the
countries where Common Law is in force,
such as Great Britain, and the United States,
and in the great majority of Canadian provinces, precedents and judgments rendered by
the highest courts of the country constitute the
law. The Common Law is the unwritten
law; it is the law which results from judiciary
precedents. On the other hand, in countries
where the written law is in force, such as

result of centuries of experience. Even if
the process is different, if the methods vary
and the premises are not always identical,
nevertheless, the result is often the same.
An Anglo-Saxon does not reason in the
same way as a European. Neither the common law countries nor the written law
countries could change systems without
running the risk of delaying considerably a
judicial evolution which cannot, however, be
allowed to remain static. But we are not
called upon to determine which is the better
system. They are both excellent. It is easy
to see, however, why each country is anxious
to keep the judicial system under which it
has developed during centuries.
Now, in all the common law countries the
stare decisis doctrine is accepted and constitutes the law of the land, while in the
written law countries, the jurisprudence,
whatever may be its value, never constitutes
the law of the land. Everybody knows that,
under section 92 of the British North America
Act, the provinces alone hold jurisdiction, at
least in matters of civil and commercial law
and in matters of procedure. These particular
matters come under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the provinces and no governmental
authority can touch these laws, let alone
change the system, unless the provincial
governments choose to do so themselves.
If this bill were to force the Supreme
Court to accept the stare decisis doctrine,
or in other words, to make the Privy Council
jurisprudence the law of the land, it would
be in direct violation of the law of the province of Quebec, which alone has the right
to make of this jurisprudence a law which
the Supreme Court would necessarily have
to follow. Such a method would be inconsistent with the Quebec law and would constitute an encroachment upon the rights
which clearly and undeniably belong to the
provinces. Let me point out, moreover, that
Quebec is not the only one concerned. If
this province alone holds the right to bring
about such a judicial change, it is nonetheless
true that in the nine other provinces of
Canada, the provincial legislatures have the
exclusive right to change the law by which
they are presently governed. If, in a mattter
of civil law, of commercial law or of procedure, one of them wanted to adopt the
written law doctrine rather than the common

law doctrine now prevailing, it could not do so
without coming into conflict with this section
which it is proposed to include in the
Supreme Court Act. This obstacle would be
the direct result of a federal encroachment
upon rights which are exclusively provincial
and would, in my opinion, constitute one of
the worst encroachments upon these rights.
Let us leave to the Supreme Court the
care of deciding the law to be applied in
each of the cases in which it is called upon
to give a decision. In the case of one of the
nine provinces following the common law
system, it will apply the law of the land and
follow the stare decisis doctrine; in the case
of the province of Quebec, however, it will
have to consider that, while the Privy Council jurisprudence constitutes a very respectable opinion, it is not the law of the province
of Quebec.
There is no reason to be alarmed about
cases of constitutional law. We derive this
right exclusively from the English law to
which indubitably the stare decisis doctrine
applies throughout the country.
Our Supreme Court has applied this principle in the matter of criminal law. Indeed,
if we review the jurisprudence of our Supreme
Court, which bas been our tribunal of last
resort in criminal matters since 1930, it is
readily seen that it has always applied the
stare decisis principle and followed the
English jurisprudence whenever there was no
provision in the Criminal Code which would
permit the settlement of the case under
review.
Some have expressed doubt on the basis of
a statement made by the honourable Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court. May I say
that his statement was fully in accord with
the doctrine of the Privy Council. In a
criminal case from the province of Quebec
involving seditious libel, a crime coming
under our Criminal Code, the Chief Justice
stated that he was not bound to follow certain English jurisprudence. This agrees perfectly with a judgment of the Privy Council
in the case of Wallace vs The King in which
the Chief Justice of the Privy Council said:
The fact remains, however, that it is in the
criminal code of the Gold Coast Colony and not in
English or Scottish cases that the law of sedition for
the colony is to be found.

Let the judges of our Supreme Court determine the application of the laws of the land.
Besides, the object of the bill under discussion is not to change the law of the country,
but simply to substitute a Canadian tribunal
for an English tribunal in relation to Cariadian
matters.
If we carry the argument one step further,
it will be found that to force the Supreme

SENATE
Court to follow the stare decisis doctrine
would mean a drastic change in the powers
of the tribunal of last instance. In fact,
the Privy Council, being a prerogative court,
is not subject to the stare decisis doctrine; the
Supreme Court, on the contrary, will be
subject to it in cases to which the doctrine
applies. I wonder why we should impose
upon the Supreme Court an obligation to
which the Privy Council is not bound.
Our Supreme Court is not a prerogative
court; it will, therefore, be bound to try cases
in accordance with the law of the land without being forced to apply its doctrine even
to cases to which it is not applicable. It is
my opinion, therefore, that this bill constitutes a tremendous improvement, inasmuch
as Canadian cases in the future will be
referred to a court bound by law to respect
the law of the land and accept the stare
decisis doctrine in cases to which it applies.
It would seem to me improper, I would
even say disrespectful to say that the judges
upon whose shoulders it is intended to lay
these responsibilities must respect the law. In
my opinion, such a statement would appear in
the eyes of the Canadian people and the
jurists of foreign countries as a want of confidence. I know of no more appropriate way
of binding the judges to respect the law than
the oath which every one of them must take
when assuming his duties.
I for one am satisfied that our Supreme
Court is made up of able, honest and independent judges; I have no doubt at all that
every one of them will respect the oath he
has taken and will continue in future to
respect the law governing each case to be
tried before him.
In conclusion, I wish to express again
my gratification that our country should
finally pass an Act which means the disappearance from Canada of a very important
relic of colonialism.
I am delighted that
my country should ordain its own judicial
independence.
I am not in the least afraid that this step
toward a more complete self-government
will be regarded as an indication of
separation. The bonds which link us to the
United Kingdom are such that, embedded
in the hearts of all Canadians, they do not
have to be sealed with a seal which is now
out of harmony with our self-government.
Canada wishes to attain full sovereignty;
the friendship and admiration we feel for
Great Britain will not grow if Canada cannot attain self-government on account of
certain bonds which prevent her from attaining her independence and from raising herself

to the status which her national pride calls
for. Neither chains nor bonds will ever foster
or cement friendship. The fewer the bonds,
the deeper and the more sincere friendship
will become, and the closer will be the cooperation between Canada and Britain, for
the protection of the interests of both
countries.
Undoubtedly we shall remember the Privy
Council with respect and gratitude, even
though we shall consider the day the law is
passed as one of the most brilliant in our
march toward complete self-government, a
day on which the perspicacity of British and
Canadian statesmen who united their might
to lead our country toward self-government,
shall show itself in the greatest harmony.
Let us hope the day is not too far off
when every Canadian, whatever his origin
or belief, shall have faith in the future
of his country, the kind of faith which moves
mountains and whose strength is the best
guarantee of the brilliant future which
every true Canadian wishes for his country.
Hon. Antoine J. Leger: Honourable senators I may be one of the few who at the
present time are opposed to the abolition of
appeals to the Privy Council. For more than
three-quarters of a century Canada and most
of its provinces have enjoyed the prerogative
of appealing to His Majesty's Privy Council
from our provincial and federal courts of
justice. We must admit that in the large
majority of cases the decisions rendered by
the Privy Council have been fair, learned,
well informed and judicious, and as such
have helped greatly to settle the law of this
country, to pacify many rancours, and often
to re-establish the peace and tranquility interrupted by prejudice; and, in constitutional
matters, to create a better feeling between
Canada and its provinces. I fail to see where
the Privy Council has done any injustice to
anyone in any of its decisions in Canadian
cases. It has always acted as an adviser to
the King and based its judgment upon expediency, law, equity and fairness.
Of course, its judgments have not pleased
all litigants. In that respect our Canadian
courts have not fared much better, as is
evidenced by the number of appeals from
their decisions, although the privilege of
appeal has never been abused.
There are those who regard appeals to the
Privy Council as indicative of humiliation or
submission on the part of Canadians, and
hence it is claimed that these appeals must
be abolished.
If abolition will serve to
enhance Canada's prestige and national pride,
it may be a move in the right direction. But
on the other hand, if it does nothing of the

OCTOBER 19, 1949
sort and is likely to have consequences detrimental to us, it is neither practical nor
desirable. The Privy Council is in its way a
unique institution, and one which has played
an important part in shaping the destiny of
the British Empire. The right of recourse
to its decisions is neither a disgrace nor an
acknowledgment of our own inferiority, but
rather a privilege which we must maintain.
It is a protection to the minority. In a
country like ours, composed of different elements, of minority rights, and of provincial
and federal rights that are liable to clash
at any moment, the privilege of appeal to
such a tribunal as the Privy Council is one
which we must preserve.
Some argument has been advanced that the
Privy Council is not familiar with our country
and that this has caused some of its decisions
to be questionable. Well, it would be just as
well to say that a medical doctor is unable
to diagnose the condition of a patient whom
he has never seen before. Surely a lawyer
is able to give a sound opinion to a client
about whom he has known nothing prior to
being consulted by the client. It is the same
with a jury. The less a jury knows about a
case before the evidence is given, the better
it is able to make a good finding after having
heard the evidence. So it is with the Privy
Council. That body is composed of men
very learned in the law who, after having
heard the arguments in a case from Canada,
are able to come to a sound and, I would say,
an unbiased opinion.
It was said yesterday that on the appeal
from the Supreme Court's decision that
women were not persons qualified to be summoned to the Senate, the Privy Council had
"tortured" the British North America Act.
Well, I venture to say that if there was any
torturing of the Act it was not done by the
Privy Council. It is true that when that Act
was passed women were not qualified to be
appointed senators, but an Act always speaks
for the present, unless there is in the Act
some direction or inference to the contrary.
In the British North America Act there is no
such inference or direction to the contrary.
Therefore women, after the passing of the
women's property acts and the granting to
women of the right to vote, became under the
British North America Act persons fully
qualified to be appointed to the Senate. To
hold otherwise would have been to hold, as
it was held, that they were not "persons"
under the Act. The Privy Council decided
that after the removal of the impediments
that had been present at the time of the
passing of the Act, women were fully qualified to be summoned as senators. I feel that

instead of torturing the British North America
Act in this case the Privy Council rendered
a good judgment.
Reference was also made to the prohibition case of 1896. In those days it was argued
that the federal parliament should have
jurisdiction in such a case, because this was
necessary for the peace, order and good
government of Canada. That argument prevailed, and the Act was said to be constitutional. Since 1896 the federal parliament has
passed many acts based upon that decision,
and this appears to have been especially so
during the period of the late parliament.
Two main arguments appear to have been
used in support of the abolition of appeals to
the Privy Council-the cost of appeals and
the plenitude of our Sovereignty. The honourable senator who just spoke (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) referred to the plenitude of our
Sovereignty. To me the plenitude of our
Sovereignty consists not in the negation of a
right, but rather in the maintenance of such
a right as long as we have a Sovereign to
whom we can appeal, through his advisers
the Privy Council, for redress from wrong or
injury. The second argument was that the
cost of carrying appeals to the Privy Council
was heavy. I would point out that this procedure is resorted to infrequently, and only
in civil matters of grave importance and in
constitutional questions. I doubt very much
if since confederation we have had an average
of more than two appeals a year.
For these reasons, honourable senators, and
particularly because it is proposed to amend
our constitution, apparently without the consent of the provinces, I am at present opposed
to the abolition of appeals to the Privy
Council.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate
was adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
October 6, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Godbout for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
let me at once express my obligation to the
leader of the government in the house (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and to my other colleagues
here for their kindness in letting this order
remain on the order paper during my absence,
which I regret, but which could not be helped.
Personally I think it is important to carry on
our business with dispatch, and because of
that feeling my regrets are all the deeper
that upon this occasion I have been the cause
of a delay in the adoption of the Address.
Having said that, may I add that it was
not my intention to take part in this debate.
One has a sense of the futility of speeches in
the difficult and uncertain times in which we
live.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But my attitude of mind
was changed by the speech delivered by my
desk-mate, the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). He advanced for
consideration by the house and by the
country a proposal which I think merits
further consideration, not only in this house
but by the Canadian people generally.
Before I come to deal more fully with that
matter, may I discharge some of the
amenities that are ordinarily observed in a
debate on the Address. The first, Mr. Speaker,
must be congratulations to you, if your
shoulders are broad enough and your back
is strong enough to support these further
expressions after the congratulations which,
sir, have been so worthily paid to you.

gross form of materialism that would submerge the individual, destroy the indivittual
human soul and make a man a mere cog, a
slave in a great governmental machine.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is the essence of
this struggle. We must never lose sight of
that fact, for if we do we may think that this
is merely a struggle between contending
forces, some with atom bombs and others
without them. If we are to comprehend
clearly what is happening in the world at
present we must understand the differences
which exist between the contenders in this
great contest.
It is interesting to make a world survey.
The recent terrible world war no doubt had
a terrific effect upon not only the economic
life of the communities engaged in it, but
upon the moral and spiritual forces of the
world.
Today we see Russia triumphant in the
East; we see the spread of this evil thing
called Communism, and what flows from it,
over all the earth. Even in democratic countries such as those of western Europe, the
United States and our own land there are
forces willing to become the tools of a foreign
power in order to strengthen and bolster up
that power in its struggle throughout the
world. So these evil forces are not confined
alone to Russia and her satellite countries.
The nations of western Europe are slowly
recovering after the paralysing blows of the
war. Several of the countries east of the
so-called Iron Curtain-once democracies,
in the sense that we understand that termare now completely under the control and
direction of the gentlemen in the Kremlin.
What is happening in Czechoslovakia at
present is not without significance. That
country was once one of the most advanced
in Europe; its government believed in and
practised the virtues of freedom and liberty.
But now Czechoslovakia has a satellite government, taking its orders from Moscow, and
destroying not only all freedom and liberty,
but the possibility of their revival. The
struggle with the churches going on at this
very moment in that country clearly indicates the determination of the rulers, in
obedience to their Moscow masters, to destroy
one remaining medium through which the
lamp of freedom and liberty might be kept
burning.
Let us consider the position of China.
Some misguided people in this country think
that the triumph of the communists in China
might be a good thing. Let them not be
deceived. The advance of communism there
means that that great eastern country-great
in natural wealth and in population-is now

under the influence of Russia. Other disturbances in the far eastern countries demonstrate that the issue is not a simple one. It
is part of a supreme struggle throughout the
world for what is best in human life; it is
part of a struggle for control of the soul of
mankind.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is saddening to me that
at the moment when we are threatened with
this evil influence the countries opposed to it
are troubled by strife and contention. Great
Britain, the originator and for generations
the guardian of freedom throughout the world,
will presently be riven in an electoral contest
that promises to be one of the most bitter in
her history. France, another great leader in
the democratic way, is divided. For the past
ten days the president of that country has
been trying to find a prime minister to form
a government. The United States, with all
its power and wealth, is distracted by widespread strikes which for the moment are
paralysing its economy. I say in all seriousness, honourable senators, that these things
do not pass unnoticed in the citadel of communism in Russia. They simply confirm the
faith of dictators who have always maintained that sooner or later the system of
freedom was bound to break down.
I believe there are lessons for us to learn
from this supreme struggle. If I can, let me
impress upon this body that what is going
on is a mighty contest between good and evil.
History gives us some lessons on what
happens when evil triumphs in the world,
though the attacks of evil were never before
waged on the present scale. I should like
to recall an event in history which has had
profound effect on the world down through
the centuries since it happened, the invasion
of western Asia by Genghis Khan in the
early part of the thirteenth century.
Now Genghis Khan was a tribal leader
away out on the steppes of Mongolia. A
supreme military genius, in his day he overran all the nearby territory and then led
his Mongolian hordes to the west. Western
Asia, Persia, Constantinople and Russia were
the most civilized countries of those days.
Persia had cities with libraries and schools,
and professors who taught the sciences and
arts. It is interesting to note that at that
time Kiev, the seat of the major prince of
Russia-and Russia was then a pretty democratic country-was a notable centre of learning; it had a university, schools, libraries and
all accessories for the advance of civilization.
But when the Mongolian hordes overran that
country they destroyed every city; they put
to flames every library and university. The
native races were driven back into the
forests and the lake country where the

on

MONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1949
The Prime Minister of India was welcomed by the Right Honourable L. S. St. Laurent,
Prime Minister of Canada, and thanked by the Honourable Elie Beauregard,
Speaker of the Senate, and the Honourable W. Ross Macdonald,
Speaker of the House of Commons.

Righ± Hon. L. S. SI-Laurent (Prime Minisier
of Canada>: Mr. Prime Minister, fellow
members of the Houses of Parliament: Our
country is indeed honoured to have as its
guest on this occasion, the Prime Minister
of India, Pandit Nehru. As Prime Minister
of a sister member nation of the commonwealth, I find it a most welcome and
agreeable duty to extend to you Mr. Nehru,
a very warmn welcome to this parliamnent and
to Canada. You corne to us both as one
whose deeds and thoughts have commanded
widespread attention in these troubled times
and as a most distinguished leader of that
great portion of mankind which constitutes
the population of India.
I extend also a cordial welcome to the
sister of our distinguished guest, Mrs Pandit,
who at present represents India as ambassador
to the United States, and to Mr. Nehru's
daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, whomn it is also a
pleasure to have with us on this occasion.
Just six months ago I was happy to
announce in this house the understanding
reached in London with regard to the continuance of India as a full member of the
commonwealth, in the event that India should
become a republic. It was flot only the
peoples of the commonwealth who had waited
to learn the outcome of the discussions; others
were watching, too; for much hung in the
balance for the three new Asian members
45785-li

which as separate units had joined the family
of the Commonwealth of Nations in 1947.
Each was heir to an ancient civilization.
Each was inspired by a strong national
consciousness and by a great vision of the
future as a member in its own right of the
international community. Each, moreover,
was keenly aware o! problems at home and
of difficulties in the world at large. Each
feit that it had a contribution to make in its
own way, suited to the genius as well as to
the needs of its people.
We in Canada feel that we have been able
to achieve some understanding of these things,
distant though we are from the great Indian
sub-continent. When India, the largest and
most populous of these new states, reached
the stage where its desires with regard te,
its constitution prompted it to settie its future
status in relation to, other commonwealth
countries, most people in Canada realized, I
think, that the constitution of India was of
course a matter for the Indian people to
decide for themselves. At the same time we
f elt that any reasonable arrangement providing for the full membership of India in
the commonwealth, as a republic, if that f orm
of constitution should be Indîa's wish, would
be welcome.
We Canadians were glad to learn that our
association with India as a sister nation in
the commonwealth was to continue, and, we

SENATE

hoped, was to become more direct and more
mutually advantageous. We are happy that
friendship, good will and understanding
exists between India and Canada. We are
conscious that we share with the government
and people of India an unswerving desire for
a peaceful world in which nations, both great
and small, may pursue the well-being of
their peoples.
On behalf of the members present and of
the people of Canada generally, I venture to
voice the hope that Mr. Nehru will carry
back to India a message of greeting and
warmest good wishes from us all.
We know of the signal courage, devotion
and loyalty with which Mr. Nehru has served
and continues to serve the people of India,
and of the statesranship and nobility of
thought which he bas brought to bear upon
the great questions of human affairs in the
councils of not only India but the commonwealth and the United Nations. We pray
that he may long be spared to continue with
his task, and to see his hopes bearing fruit.
Fellow members of the houses of parliament, I present to you the Prime Minister
of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru: I am grateful to
you, Sir, and the honourable members of this
parliament for the honour you have done me
in inviting me to address you, and for the
warm welcome which you have been good
enough to extend to me. I am happy to be in
the capital of this great dominion and to
bring to you the greetings and good wishes of
the government and people of India.
During the past twelve months it has been
my privilege to be associated in important
discussions with your Prime Minister, Mr. St.
Laurent, and your Secretary of State for
External Affairs, Mr. Pearson. We have had
to consider many difficult problems together,
and I am revealing no secret when I say that
our point of view and Canada's were identical
or very near to each other on almost every
one of them. In particular I should like to
refer to the spirit of understanding shown by
your government and your representative at
the meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers,
held in London last April, in the determination of our future relationship with the Commonwealth. That spirit is in the great tradition of your leaders, Sir John Macdonald, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, and your last Prime Minister,
Mr. Mackenzie King, who happily is still with
us. That tradition has been one of association with the Commonwealth, in complete
freedom, unfettered by any outside control.
Canada has been a pioneer in the evolution
of this relationship and, as such, one of the
builders of the Commonwealth as an association of free and equal nations. India, as you
know, will soon become a republic, but will

remain a member of the Commonwealth. Our
past co-operation will not, therefore, cease or
alter with the change in our status. On the
contrary, it will have the greater strength
that common endeavour derives from a sense
that it is inspired and sustained by the free
will of free peoples. I am convinced that this
development in the history of the Commonwealth, without parallel elsewhere or at any
other time, is a significant step towards peace
and co-operation in the world.
Of even greater significance is the manner
of its achievement. Only a few years ago
Indian nationalism was in conflict with
British imperialism, and that conflict brought
in its train ill w'ill, suspicion and bitternessalthough, because of the teaching of our great
leader, Mahatma Gandhi, there was far less
ill will than in any other nationalist struggle
against foreign domination. Who would have
thought then that suspicion and bitterness
would largely fade away so rapidly, giving
place to friendly co-operation between free
and equal nations? That is an achievement
for which all -those who are concerned with
it can take legitimate credit. It is an outstanding example of the peaceful solution of
difficult problems, a solution which is a real
one because it does not lead to other problems. The rest of the world might well pr y
heed to this example.
Canada is a vast country and her extent i
continental. She faces Europe across the
Atlantic, and Asia across the Pacific. Pa t
history explains your preoccupation thus faý
with European affairs. Past history also, as
well as geography, explain the depth and
intimacy of our interest in Asia. But in the
world of today, neither you nor we can afford
to be purely national or even continental, in
our outlook; the world bas become too small
for that. If we do not all co-operate and live
at peace with each other, we stumble on one
another and clutch at each other's throats.
We talk of the East and the West, of the
Orient and the Occident; yet these divisions
have little reality. In fact the so-called East
is geographically the West for you. During
the last two or three hundred years some
European nations developed an industrial
civilization and thus became different in
many ways from the East, which was still
primarily agricultural. The new strength that
technical advance gave them added to their
wealth and power, and an era of colonialism
and imperialism began during which the
greater part of Asia was dominated by some
countries of Europe. In the long perspective
of history this was a brief period, and already
we are seeing the end of it. The imperialism
which was at its height during the last
century-and-a-half has largely faded away,
and lingers in only a few countries today.

Before I conclude, Mr. Prime Minister, I should very much like to say a few
words in French. I am sorry I am not proficient enough in that beautiful language to
speak at length, but I assure you we have
a deep liking for it.
To you, French Canadians, I convey the
congratulations and warm wishes of the
people of India, to which I add my own.
(Translation):
Hon. Elie Beauregard (Speaker of the
Senate): Mr. Prime Minister of India, since
you chose to conclude your brilliant speech

in the language spoken by three to four
million Canadians of French origin, may I on
their behalf express their keen pleasure, and
offer you in French a token of their admiration.
Your accession to power coincides with
India's entry into the large democratie family
of the universe. Thanks to you, your great
and diversified country, so rich in science,
poetry and storied legend, peacefully takes
its place within the council of sovereign
nations. At the same time, you are resolutely
entering into history.
You come from the Orient, whose patient
philosophy knows the art of solving the most
complex situations, an art which enabled you
to sever your century-old union with the
British Empire and, almost at the same time,
spontaneously to renew a link with the
Commonwealth.
At this very time of your visit among
us, we, under different circumstances and
in the normal course of our development,
are peacefully making an almost identical
gesture. In a few days Canada, whose stature
has grown during the last two wars without,
however, leaving the orbit of the Commonwealth, will be solely responsible for its
own destiny.
You bring the West a message of peace, of
peace basedi on the equality of all men before
God, before the law and before human
conscience. You nevertheless wish India to
become aware of its power, first of its
economic power and then of the military
power needed to protect that economic power.
You already know týhat America, whose
mission is at present burdened with such a
heavy responsibility, joyfully welcomes your
message.
Thanks to the high standard of
living created by the industry of our neighbouring republic, the extremely varied races
which are its components, merged together as
though in a crucible, have become a proud
and powerful nation. In this country also, we
believe that the standard of living constitutes the best means of defence against the
most pernicious "isms". Your country, under
the impetus it is certain to receive from you,
so plentifully endowed with manpower and
natural resources, can rightfully aspire to
full economic development.
Because of your academic training and
your public life, you belong to two civilizations. Both will benefit from the leading role
which your high office will call upon you to
play in world affairs. This is betokened by
the eloquent speech you have just delivered
before both Houses of Parliament, and that
is the wish we express.
It is a great honour for me, Mr. Prime
Minister, to express, on behalf of both the

The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I would advise the house that the
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson), in whose name stands the
second item on our Order Paper has requested
that we proceed with ýthat item first. He is
anxious to dispose of it before we carry on
with other business.

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson moved the
second reading of Bill Y-3, an Act respecting
the British and Foreign Bible Society in
Canada and Newfoundland.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is simply to eliminate the words
"and Newfoundland" in the name of the
society, because of the fact that Newfoundland is now part of Canada. It will be seen
from section 1 that the rights and privileges
of the original society are not affected by this
change. They are all protected.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable members,
with unanimous leave of the Senate, I would
'nove that this bill be given third reading
new, for it is not important enough to require
a reference to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and pasred.

The motion was agreed to.
SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
October 19, the adjourncd debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second
reading of Bill 2, an Act to amend the
Supreme Court Act.
Hon. J. W. De B. Farris: Honourable senators, the desire which other honourable members have shown to get their bills or motions
through before I begin indicates some apprehension as to the length of my speech. Prior
to our adjcurnment for Thanksgiving I had
made some brief notes which I planned to use

OCTOBER 25, 1949
as the basis of a speech confined entirely to
what should happen after this bill has been
passed. However, I was away one afternoon
and lost the opportunity to speak. Then,
after having read the speech by my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), which everyone assures me and
which my own reading confirms was a powerful and able address, I felt that there was
another side to this question, and that it was
incumbent on me or some other senator to
present that side. I am taking the responsibility of doing so now.
I do not intend to oppose the bill when the
time comes for voting on it. Honourable senators who were here last session and at previous sessions know that I have expressed
myself against the abolition of appeals to the
Privy Council, at any rate for the present.
I stated my reasons for that stand last year,
and I do not intend to repeat them now. But
holding the views personally that I do, the
reason that I do not feel justified as a senator in opposing this bill is quite obvious.
Last year the Liberal party held a national
convention in the city of Ottawa, and at it
they passed, as part of the Liberal platform,
a resolution in favour of abolishing appeals
to the Privy Council. Last spring when parliament was sitting the government introduced, in the name of the Minister of Justice,
a bill to implement this proposal. That was
a confirmed declaration to all Canada of the
policy of the Liberal party. While that bill
was still on the Order Paper, parliament was
dissolved, and an election followed. Now, as
far as I know, there was no public discussion
of this plank in the Liberal platform during
that election campaign. No other party and
no individual saw fit to make the question a
definite issue. Therefore, as I interpret it,
that question went by default. The Liberal
party was returned by a very large majority,
which seems to me an almost unanimous
mandate from the people of Canada to enact
this legislation. Under my conception of the
strict limitation of the rights and powers of
the Senate-what is termed by Dicey the conventions of the constitution-it seems to me
that at this time there is imposed upon the
Senate the obligation not to oppose this legislation. However, that is not the whole
question.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), in his very able speech, took
a very strong stand on the reasons why
appeals to the Privy Council should be
abolished. I am not in agreement with those
reasons, and, with all deference to my honourable friend, I do not think they accurately
represent the reasons why the people of
Canada generally are in favour of the abolition of the Senate45785-12

Sorne Hon. Members: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I mean appeals to the
Privy Council. I was a little ahead in my
thinking.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Too far ahead, I hope.
Hon. Mr. Farris: One thing leads to another,
and we never know what may happen in
this world.
If this action must be taken, I would prefer
to stand on the ground taken by the Minister
of Justice in his speech before the House of
Commons on September 20, last, in which
he said:
If we no longer wish to have the United Kingdom
Privy Council hear the final appeals of our Canadian lawsuits, and to be the ultimate interpreter of
the laws which we make in this chamber, it is not
because the Privy Council is not today perhaps the
strongest law court in the world. We shall always
be grateful for the massive judicial services which
the Privy Council has performed for this country.
We shall still remain conscious of its greatness as
a court of exclusive ultimate appellate jurisdiction.
Indeed, sir, we desire in our Supreme Court to
emulate that greatness as a court of ultimate exclusive appellate jurisdiction; and we think that the
best, if not the only way, in which we can begin
to do so, is to make our own Supreme Court also
one of exclusive appellate and ultimate jurisdiction, by passing the bill we now have before us.

My honourable friend from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) who spoke in this house
in French on October 19, the translation of
his remarks appearing as an appendix to the
Debates of October 20, had this to say:
I admire greatly the English judges who in the
past have carried out such important functions.
They are learned men of unquestionable integrity.
In other words, they are great jurists. It must be
recognized, however, that if it be true that England
has produced great jurists, France, Belgium, Italy,
Switzerland and other countries have also had
theirs.
Canada, too, has ber great jurists. Her magistrature is one of those who command the respect of
the nation. We need not have any fear in entrusting them with the responsibility of interpreting our
laws. They will perform this important function
with as much if not more dash than those who
have carried it out in the past.

Without necessarily assenting to the idea
about the "dash" these judges will display, I
feel that the reasons advanced by my honourable colleague from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) and by the Minister of Justice are
the best grounds upon which parliament
should consider this question. But my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has gone very much further. I hope
honourable senators will understand, as I
am sure my honourable friend from Inkerman does, that anything I say here is meant
in no personal way whatever. My honourable
friend and I came into the Senate at the
same time. Our relations are those of mutual
respect and liking, and I know of no more
useful and valuable senator than my honourable friend. I disagree very strongly with

so no doubt there are omissions. Among Vancouver at the lime, and after reading the

OCTOBER 25, 1949
speech I said to the editor of the Vancouver
Province, who was a strict Conservative and
the editor of a very strict Conservative paper,
"I think I shall take the next train to Ottawa
and reply in the Senate to Mr. Cahan's
speech." Knowing that I was tied up in
business at the time, he said to me, "That is
not necessary; the Vancouver Province is at
your disposal". I wrote a lengthy reply consisting of four or five full columns. Mr.
Cahan answered me in the same paper and
I again replied to him. Therefore, what I
say now is not said without knowledge at
the time of Mr. Cahan's speech. Honourable
senators, that was one of the most bitter
speeches I ever read, and I could not help
wondering if Mr. Cahan's experience in the
Privy Council had helped to embitter him.
He has gone now, and I cannot do more than
suggest that there must have been some
reason for his attitude, because his speech
was more than a cool criticism of the Privy
Council. What I regret is that my honourable
friend from Inkerman took so much information for his speech from the bitter lips of the
Honourable Mr. Cahan.
The other gentleman from whom my
honourable colleague from Inkerman acquired
information was our late esteemed friend,
Mr. W. F. O'Connor, who was Parliamentary
Counsel to this chamber. I knew Mr. O'Connor
well, and when he completed the book to
which my honourable friend referred, I and
the present leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) moved and seconded a resolution
expressing our appreciation of the great work
Mr. O'Connor had done. However, I think
it was explained that we did not agree with
all that was contained in the report, although
we appreciated the great effort devoted to it.
There was no bitterness in Mr. O'Connor's
criticisms, such as there were in Mr. Cahan's
speech.
Mr. O'Connor, however, was one
of those men possessed of certain pet theories.
He was a good lawyer, a fine public servant,
a man whom we all respected and admired,
but he did have some pet theories with which
I could never agree. Sometimes I had trouble
in finding out exactly what he meant. One
of his ideas was that legislation should run
concurrently in both federal and provincial
jurisdictions, each with its own aspect. If
any honourable senator wants to follow that
further I would recommend that he read
through Mr. O'Connor's book to get that
viewpoint. Mr. O'Connor was an extremist
in these things, and while he was extremely
well informed, I would not recommend that
at this stage anybody should accept the views
which he held as proof of his conclusions.
Then my honourable friend from Inkerman quoted Lord Haldane on Lord Watson,
to whom Mr. Cahan referred in his speech
45785-12

of ten or eleven years ago. In his article
about Lord Watson, which was quoted by
my honourable friend, Lord Haldane pointed
out that Lord Watson had brought to bear on
his interpretation of the constitution all
his experiences as a great statesman and
He said that many gaps in our
lawyer.
constitution had been left there intentionally
by parliament, and that it was not always
possible to fI them in by strict legal interpretation. He claimed that sometimes the
direct legal interpretation could not be found
without the application of a comprehensive
knowledge. My honourable friend interpreted
Lord Haldane's article as suggesting that
Lord Watson had departed from judicial interpretation and, for his own political reasons,
had given political bent to his judgment. Since my honourable friend made that
statement I have read Lord Haldane's article
several times, and I say-and I leave it to
honourable members to read it for themselves
-that I do not think that was the intent of
what Lord Haldane said: I do not think that
is an accurate interpretation of what he said.
In effect, my honourable friend from
Inkerman charged that as a result of Lord
Watson's strong personality and his wide
experience, judicial and otherwise, the Privy
Council committed the unpardonable offence
of building up the provinces at the expense
of the dominion and to the detriment of
Canada.
Honourable senators may escape part of
my speech, for I seem to have mislaid one
page of my notes. However, we may be able
to get along without it.
I agree, as I said before, that as a result
of the judgments of Lord Watson, Lord
Haldane and some other judges, the threat
of centralization of authority at Ottawa in
the interpretation of our constitution was
checked, and the constitution was interpreted
so as to give more recogniLion to the rights
of the provinces. From my reading and
understanding of the Privy Council's decisions, I challenge absolutely the view that
they were made from any ulterior motive or
with any other desire on the part of those
great judges-for they were great-than to
apply their minds to the utmost of their
capacity to giving a correct judicial interpretation to our constitution.
senators, the next
Now, honourable
question to ask is, whether those decisions
that have been criticised were wrong and
did harm to Canadian unity. Well, Lord
Watson wrote two outstanding decisions. The
first was in a case from my old province
of New Brunswick, the Liquidators of the
Maritime Bank of Canada against the
Receiver General. It was a controversy
between the province and the dominion as

SENATE
to priorities. It is interesting to note here
that Lord Watson's decision was handed
down in 1892, one year after my honourable
friend from Inkerman was born, and that in
the meantime, notwithstanding the decision,
both he and the constitution have survived
and prospered.
I submit to you that the
unity of Canada is proved today by the
present assembly, with my honourable friend
as one of its members enjoying the great
national achievement that is Canada.
Here is what Lord Watson said-and this
is the basis of the attack made by those two
great
Nova Scotia
Tories,
Cahan
and
O'Connor.
Their lordships do not think it necessary to examine, in minute detail, the provisions of the
Act of 1867, which nowhere profess to curtail in any
respect the rights and privileges of the crown, or
to disturb the relations then subsisting between the
sovereign and the provinces. The object of the Act
was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to
subordinate provincial governments to a central
authority, but to create a federal government in
which they should all be represented, entrusted with
the exclusive administration of affairs in which
they had a common interest, each province retaining
its independence and autonomy. That object was
acconiplished by distributing, between the dominion
and the provinces, all poweis executive and legislative, and all public property and revenues which
had previously belonged to the provinces; so that
the dominion government should be vested with
such of these powers, property and revenues as
were necessary for the due performance of its constitutional functions, and that the remainder should
be retained by the provinces for the purposes of
provincial goverrnment. But, in so far as regards
those matters which, by section 92, are specially
reserved for provincal legislation, the legislation of
eaci province continues to be free from the control
of the dominion, and as supreme as it was before
the passing of the act.

That, honourable senators. is the foundation
of the present-day interpretation of the
Canadian constitution, and I ask: Where is
there in Canada a man, including my
honlourable
friend from Inkerman, who
challenges the soundness and effectiveness of
those propositions?
A few years later the Privy Council handed
down the other decision which was under
attack by Messrs. Cahan and O'Connor. It
is known generally and may' be easily
referred to as the 1896 Liquor Case. It is
net necessary to state the details upon which
the decision was based, but one of the matters
considered there was the meaning of the
opening words of section 91 of the British
North America Act which empower the
federal parliament to make laws for the
peace, order and good government of Canada.
The argument was made at that time that
matters which in one aspect are purely provincial in character might in another aspect
be considered te be national in character,
and that therefore the federal parliament
could legislate on any question under the
guise of peace, order and good government.

Federal legislation always overrides provincial, and if that argument had been maintained the provision which is the backbone
of provincial jurisdiction-the provision in
the British North America Act relating to
property and civil rights-would be, to use
a common expression, pretty nearly gone
out the window. The Privy Council had to
face that issue, and here is their decision,
as delivered by Lord Watson, who has been
charged with rendering a political judgment.
I am reading from Cameron, The Canadian
Constitution, page 491:
These enactments appear to their lordships to
indicate that the exercise of legislative power by
the Parliament of Canada, in regard to all matters
not enunerated in section 91, ought to be strictly
confined to such matters as are unquestionably
of Canadian interest and importance, and ought
not to trench upon provincial legislation with
respect to any of the classes of subjects enuinerated in section 92.

Would anyone here dispute that?
Of
course, in time of war an exception is made.
Lord Haldane laid down the doctrine that
during a war property and civil rights must
of necessity take on a different aspect and for
the time being fall within the jurisdiction of
the dominion, although in ordinary times
it is within provincial jurisdiction.
Lord Watson refused to assent to the idea
that because every province is interested in
property and civil rights the subject is therefore of national interest and can be legislated
upon by the federal parliament.
The judgment continues:
To attach any other construction to the general
power which, in supplement of its enumerated
powers, is conferred upon the Parliament of Canada
by section 91, would, in their Lordship's opinion,
not only be contrary to the intendment of the act
but would practically destroy the autonomy of the
provinces.

Would any honourable senator question
the soundness of that statement?
Would
anyone here venture the opinion that it
would have been a good thing by a contrary
decision so to destroy the autonomy of the
provinces?
The judgment goes on:
If it were once conceded that the Parliament of
Canada bas authority to make laws applicable to
the whole dominion, in relation to matters which
in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order, and good
government of the dominion, there is hardly a
subject enumerated in section 92 upon which it
might not legislate, to the exclusion of the provincial legislatures.

Those are the two decisions of Lord Watson
that were the basis of the attack made by
Mr. C. H. Cahan, and reiterated here by my
honourable friend.
Now, for a moment, I speak chiefly to the
honourable members on this side of the
house. In my understanding it has been the

OCTOBER 25, 1949

Liberal party which throughout the history
of Canada has fought the battle of provincial
rights. It did not fight that battle to stir up
animosity, or to do as I might do now
if I wanted to indulge in some political
insinuation concerning what is going on in
some quarters today. The primary mover
in that policy by the Liberal party was Sir
Oliver Mowat. I hold in my hand, honourable members, a biographical sketch of Sir
Oliver Mowat by Mr. C. R. W. Biggar-not
O. M. Biggar, whom we know so well. It
contains some editorials, one of which is by
J. S. Willison, whom honourable members
will recall as a Conservative who later wrote
the Life of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. This editorial, which is to be found at page 842 of
Volume 2, reads as follows:
He seems, however, to have been a federalist from
the outset, and in complete sympathy with Brown's
agitation for representation according to population
He

seconded Brown's motions in 1864, declaring that the
old legislative union was a failure, and could not
be advantageously maintained, and that the remedy
for the unsatisfactory conditions which then prevailed was to be found in the formation of two or
more local governments. with some joint authority
charged with such matters as were necessarily
common to both sections of the province. This was
the germ of confederation; and it was natural that
he should be selected as one of Brown's colleagues in the great coalition cabinet. Owing, however, to his appointment to the Vice-Chancellorship
of Upper Canada he was for a time unable to advise
upon the actual details of the British North
America Act; and it is no doubt owing also to this
incident that all his later years of political activity
were devoted to provincial rather than to national
afTairs.
He was, however, greatly instrumental in determining the federal character of the constitution.

We, here today, have attacked a great judge
who had, from a legal standpoint, the same
viewpoint.

The editorial continues:
If he had remained in the Coalition Government
he would doubtless have been the staunch ally of
George Brown and Sir Geo. E. Cartier in resisting
Sir John Macdonald's project of a legislative union,
and in engrafting the principle of federalism firrnly
upon the new Constitution. His greater political
achievements centre in his long and triumphant
struggle with the Conservative leader to establish
the ample constitutional powers of the provinces,
and in particular to maintain the legislative and
territorial rights of Ontario.

Sir Oliver Mowat, honourable senators, was
a great leader of the Liberal party before,
during and after confederation. As far as I
know, this party has never departed from its
basic and fundamental view that it is just
as essential for national unity to preserve,
within its field of activity, the status of the
province as it is to maintain the status of the
dominion itself.
Honourable senators, sometimes we are
misled by the mere fact that in population
Canada is comparatively small. But I would
point out that we have half a continent, a

country bigger than Europe with all its
political and national divisions. Had it ever
been attempted in this country-particularly
in the earlier days of confederation when
transportation was not as it is today-to
unduly centralize government in Ottawa,
there would have been an unrest and a discontent the seriousness of which no one can
appreciate. I come from the province farthest
from the city of Ottawa. From Victoria to
Ottawa is as far as from Ottawa to London.
But for a Lieutenant-Governor and the trappings and pomp, if you will, that go with that
office, the people of British Columbia during
the past seventy years might as well have
been in Timbuktu. We would have been,
and indeed we were for a long time, almost
as detached from Ottawa as we were from
London. The strong centralizing force of,
not authority but sentiment, and the building
up of a national opinion in Canada, has been
the result of these great decisions of the Privy
Council and of the efforts of outstanding men,
like Sir Oliver Mowat, who championed the
Liberal party down through the years in its
fight for principles. I would be very sorry,
as I am sure my honourable friend would be,
to hear any suggestion that the Liberal party
should in any shape or form depart from the
high ideal which formed its basic principle
of national unity.
Now so much for my honourable friend's
first attack. His second point rests on what
he terms the theory of interpretation, based
on the living tree. Honourable senators will
recall that several ladies from Western Canada carried an appeal to the Privy Council
on the question of the right of women to sit
in the Senate. The learned judge of the
Privy Council who wrote the decision, which
was the decision of all the members of the
Privy Council, considered the question. The
learned judges in the court of Canada had
taken the view that they were restricted by
the definition of a qualified person at the
time of confederation. The learned judge
of the Privy Council said that was too literal
and too narrow a sense in which to interpret
a constitution, which is an organic thing that
has to expand and adjust itself according
to the vicisgitudes and changes which occur
in a country as time proceeds. As an illustration-not for the purpose of literal application-he likened the British North America
Act to a tree that one might plant in the
garden, which would have to be pruned and
adjusted as its growth took effect.
My honourable friend was not satisfied to
merely attack that principle, but he went
further. He said, first, that in the Edwards
case-generally called the "Persons" casethe learned Judges of the Privy Council knew
that public opinion in Canada was in favour

OCTOBER 25, 1949
I have Lord Sankey's judgrnent here, and
I find that that is the very thing he said. I
cail my honourable friend's attention to
Plaxton's Canadian Constitutionctl Decisions
of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, page 16, where Lord Sankey, at the very
beginnîng of his judgment, said:
The question at issue in this appeal is whether
the words "qualified persons" in that section
include a woman. and consequently whether wornen
are eligible to be summoned to and become memabers of the Senate of Canada.

The complaint my honourable friend makes
as the basis of hîs suggestion that Lord Sankey
apparently had deliberately tried to make a
fool out of the Supreme Court, is answered
in the second paragraph of Lord Sankey's
judgment.
I complain of two speeches which have
been made in this house, one by the honourable member from Inkerman, the other by
the honourabie lady member from. Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis). The lady member
frorn Peterborough did what rny honourable
friend said the Privy Council did: she
belittled, though in most skilful fashion, the
Supreme Court of Canada for deciding that
a woman was not a "person". But the
Supreme Court neyer said that. Ail the
Supreme Court of Canada said was that the
words "qualified persons", within the meaning of the Act, looked at in its historical
setting, did not include women. So when the
honourable lady member assumned on the
strength of the text to discrédit the judgment
of the Supreme Court, I would criticize her
remarks as being out of place. But I say to
my honourable friend fromn Inkerman that
he is not a whit better. He merely puts the
shoe on the other foot in accusing the Privy
Council of doing the very thing that, by
inference, he criticîzes the lady member from
Peterborough for doing.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They misled the lady
member for Peterborough. That is what 1
complain of.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I arn afraid they misled
my honourabie friend frorn Inkerman, because
he has not correctiy read the judgment of
the Privy Council. Nothing in that judgment
entities anyone to say that any refiection was
cast upon the Supreme Court of Canada. So
I repeat that, in drawing the inférence she
did, the lady member from Peterborough was
not justified, and that my honourable friend
from. Inkerman, in complaining that the Privy
Council gave the lead by doing the same
thing deliberately, is committing the sarne
offence as she did.
After my honourable friend had used
against the Privy Council ail the expressions
that I have mentioned, he f ound occasion at
the end of his speech to pay high tribute to

that body and to suggest that after the bill
is passed the governrnent should tender a
formai expression of thanks to the Privy
Council as a kind of fond farewell. I amn
heartly in accord wjth that. As a matter of
fact, I spoke about it to rny honourable friend
on my right (Hon. Mr. David) before I knew
that the honourable gentleman fromn Inkerman had proposed it. I arn stili just as much
in f avour of it is I was before, but if a formai
expression of thanks were conveyed to the
Privy Council and the staternents of my
honourable friend from Inkerman remained
unchallenged on our records as apparently
expressing the unanimous opinion of the
Senate, I imagine their Lordships of the Privy
Council would each have f eit like saying
someth-ing along this line:
When late I attempted your pity to move,
Why seemed you so deaf to my prayers?
Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,
But-why should you kick me ciownstairs?

Honourabie senators, s0 f ar in these
remarks I have had oniy one motive, to show
that there was not compiete unanimity in the
Senate as to the alleged evils of the system
of appeais to the Privy Council. I wished
particularly to do that at this time, whert we
are about to pass an Act severing relationships which I think have been very valuable
to us during ail the years of confederation.
Now may I corne to what I had intended
to say in this debate before my honourable
friend's speech was made? The Minister of
Just;ice has said that he hopes the Supreme
Court of Canada wiil emulate and take its
inspiration from the great court which. has
preceded it as a court of final appeal for
Canada. 1 want to make a few points as to
the future. This bill wiil of course pass the
Senate and in a few days will become law,
whereupon new and greater responsibîlities
will fall upon the courts of Canada, and on
parliament, standing býehind our courts.
One matter that has been discussed a great
deal is the doctrine of stare decisis, especially
since the passing of a resolution by the
Canadian Bar Association. Here I wish to
refer to the great contrast between the way in
which some recommendations of the Bar
Association were considered in a Senate committee this morning and the way in which
the Bar Association's resolution respecting the
doctrine of stare decisis has been considered.
In my opinion, and in that of practicaily al
the lawyers with whorn I have discussed. the
matter, the rule of stare decisis will govern
in the future just as mueh as it has governed
in the past when our h-ighest court of appeal
was the Privy Council. I wiil not question
the staternent made 'by my honourable friend
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) as to
interprétation of the law in Quebec; but in

SENATE
the other provinces the rule of stare decisis
has always been recognized as part of the
common
law.
The substitution of the
Supreme Court for the Privy Council as our
court of last appeal will not wipe out the
judicial history of Canada, and the authorities which have been followed in the past
will continue to be regarded as binding.
The next question that has been raised is
whether the Supreme Court of Canada,
appointed by the government of this country,
can be relied on to interpret our constitution
effectively. As I understand it, the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Justice have
said positively that the Supreme Court has
always acted fairly, impartially, honestly and
competently, and thet with its new and added
responsibilities it will continue to do so. I do
not think we need have any worry in that
regard.
Then I wish to say a few words as to the
conclusion drawn by the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Justice that our Supreme
Court, receiving its inspiration from the Privy
Council, will be-I am stating this in my own
words-just as great, distinguished and able
a court of last resort as the Privy Council bas
been. That is a fine ideal, and I have no
doubt that as time goes on it will work out.
But there is a danger of our being just a
little too complacent about it. It is not good
enough to stand up and nake speeches to
the effect that we are just as good as Englishmen, that we can find just as good judges in
Canaaia as we had in England. That statem

t

wil

not

,o us an

gool unless we are

resolved to sec that it is carried out. And we
rnight as well face the fact that at times it
will be difflcult to secure the very best men
fer judges in this country. Leok ovr the
field of the past gcneratien.
The great
Canadian lawyers of the past generation who
corne to my mind are Eugene Lafleur and
Aime Geoffrion, of Montreal, W. N. Tilley, of
Toronto, and E. P. Davis of Vancouver. Not
one of those men ever sat on the bench, but
I believe that had they lived in England
every one of then would, in their later years,
have been appointed to some high judicial
position, on the Court of Appeal or in the
House of Lords.
England has forty million people as against
our thirteen million. Our new Supreme Court
will have three judges from Quebec, and by
implication there will not be more than that
from that province. Suppose there is a
vacancy while the. Quebec quota of three
judges is filled, and when, obviously, the
ablest lawyer in sight is practising in that
province. He will not get the appointment,
for it would have to be made on a territorial
basis that would exclude him. The racial

and religious background of possible appointees will also have to be taken into
consideration. I am not saying anything
against that systern now; I am simply pointing out that it will add to the problern of
securing the ablest men for the Supreme
Court. I have no doubt that at some time
the ablest lawyer might be in the Maritime
provinces or in British Columbia, yet because
of geographic considerations it might not be
possible to appoint him to fill a vacancy.
Such considerations, which are very proper
in this country, do not have to be taken
account of in England.
Then there are political considerations. Weil,
I suppose they carry some weight in Enland,
although the present Lord Chancellor, Lord
Jowitt, told the American Bar last year that
since he has held his present office not a
single lawyer belonging to his party has been
elevated to the bench. Here is another point.
In England when a lawyer quits a lucrative
practice to become a judge Le is at once
made a knight or a peer, and his wife has
the title of lady. They live in London, a
beautiful city, in the very cen.re of the
national life and within easy reach of the
rest of the country. I have never been and
do not expect to be offered a judgeship at
Ottawa; but if I were, I should hesiLate to
move here permanently, three thousand niles
away from my present home and the home of
my children and grandchildren. In England
thee sane sacrifices do not have to be made.
These prolems are only common
to this
country.
Most lawyers whom I k1e
itV big
incomes spend as they go, ant because aIl of
their income is taxable they haeýe no opportunity
te
sae.
Therefore,
honourable
senators, the hrst
consideration
in te
appointment of judges in Canada
rill be
not merely the desire on the part of the
Minister of Justice to secure the most able
men, but the ability to offer them a fitting
inducement to come to Ottawa. It is no
disgrace to any lawyer who has a family and
other responsibilities, to ask that Le not be
requested to sacrifice too much in coming
to Ottawa from some other part of Canada.
I am pleased to note that the Minister of
Justice has announced that the salary of the
chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada
will be increased to $25,000, and the salaries
of the other judges to $20,000. The lawyers,
through
their
resolutions, recommended
more than that. I noticed, honourable senators, that Donald Gordon, a great man in
Canada, has been promoted to a high office.
I do not know what his salary will be in
that position, but it was stated recently in
the press that as Deputy Governor of the
Bank of Canada Le received $30,000.
I

OCTOBER 25, 1949
venture to say that he will receive more than
that in his new position, and that Graham
Towers, as Governor of the Bank of Canada,
has an income of more than $30,000.
Honourable senators, I point out these
facts because the basis of all organized society
under our system of civilization is the proper
administration of justice. I wish also to
draw to your attention to the fact that there
has been no increase in the salaries of the
judges of other courts. This discrepancy is
very marked, particularly as it applies to
the judges of the courts of appeal in the
provinces. Further, there is a marked
difference between the salaries of the trial
judges and those of the Supreme Court of
Canada. This is sometimes not appreciated
by the layman, but it is a vital factor in the
successful administration of justice. The
effectiveness of the Supreme Court of Canada
as the highest court in the land will depend
to a considerable degree upon the kind of
cases that are sent up to it from the courts
of appeal and the trial courts. For years
the Privy Council has expressed the strongest
desire that cases should come to it by way
of the Supreme Court, so that it might have
the benefit of the advice and opinions of that
court. It follows that only the best judgment and thought in legal matters should
reach to the Supreme Court of Canada from
the courts of the provinces.
I may point out that in this country the
trial judges are almost exclusively the
judges of fact. If the trial court and the
court of appeal agree on the facts in a case.
the final court will not consider them at ail.
Very often a consideration of the facts is at
the basis on which a litigant receives justice
or otherwise. We talk about the Privy
Council being the rich man's court. The
lower court is really the poor man's court as
only a handful of cases come to Ottawa and
it is in the lower courts that the poor man
has his day. It is essential above all else
that the judges of those courts be just as
fairly treated as are the judges who sit in
Ottawa in the highest court. Every member
of the Senate and of the House of Commons
should look upon the administration of

justice as quite equal in importance to the
job of handling the Bank of Canada, the
Canadian National Railways, or any other
job that commands a much higher salary.
I say, therefore, that there should be an
increase in judges' salaries all down the
line.
In conclusion, I say that in its final analysis
the survival of our civilization will depend
on the administration of justice.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I was told the other day
the Brüning, the one time German Chancellor
who had trouble with Hitler and later went
to the United States to become a university
professor there, said that the first sign of
break in Germany was on the part of the
judges, when they started to take dictation
from the political power in that country.
After appearing before tribunals which do
not have the tradition or the appreciation of
justice that our courts have, I have found it
very refreshing to return from that atmosphere to our courts, where justice reigns
supreme. The brains on the courts may not
always have been of the highest character,
but on the whole their judgment has been
good and, as I say, justice reigns supreme.
If that standard is to continue in this country, and is to be the bulwark against subversive forces, that spirit of justice must be
present not only in the judges, but also in
the people behind the judges. It must come
from society. One hears talk about the
fountainhead of justice. The real fountainhead of justice is the idealism of the people.
We have inherited our system in this country
from our ancestors across the waters, through
the French law and the British law, and we
have not allowed it to become sullied. My
one wish and plea is that as time goes on our
system of administering justice in Canada
may remain supreme and triumphant.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Marcotte the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 2, an
Act to amend the Supreme Court Act.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: I wish to take
advantage of the opportunity afforded by
this my first address this session to extend
to our new president my congratulations on
his appointment to his present high position.
I know that he fully deserves the honour,
and I wish him health and happiness during
his term of office.
Honourable senators, I intend to make my
remarks very brief, as on certain aspects of
this question of amending our constitution
there will be another opportunity to fully
cover the constitution field.
My main argument in opposition to this
bill is based, not on the principle of the bill
but on the fact that the provinces have not
been consulted before its presentation. The
letters exchanged between the Prime Minister of the federal government and the provincial premiers show the desire of the

provincial governments to have a conference
before any changes are made in our constitution.
The press have been dedicating page after
page to the subject of this controversy, and
I think that you will agree with me that the
question of amending our constitution is
one of the most important which has come
before parliament in many years. The old
controversy as to whether that constitution
is a statute or a contract is taking a new lease
of life, and is becoming very bitter.
In order to give you my point of view on
this moot question, I will refer to a paragraph of a speech that I made on the same
subject quite a few years ago. I refer to the
Debates of the Senate of Monday, June 15,
1936, page 553:
The British North America Act is more than a
contract or a treaty, more than a compromise or an
entente.
It contains al the requisites of these
definitions, with something more. There was in
1867 only one power great enough to create this confederation, to give the different units the capacity
to enter into such a contract, to confirm that compromise, to consecrate that entente, to ratify that
treaty. That power was the Imperial Government.
After years of preparation, months of discussion
and some conferences, the provinces brought to the
Imperial Government the result of their deliberations in the form of resolutions, and after further
discussions and amendments the Imperial Government enacted the statute called the British North
America Act. It created a constitution similar in
principle to the English constitution, which still is
the model constitution for democracies.

I will make just two citations on this point,

so that, whether you regard the British North
America Act as merely a statute or a contract,
you will understand why I maintain that the
provinces have a right to be consulted on any
amendment which concerns them.

I quote

first fron Law Reports, Appeal Cases, 1932,
page 70, a decision of the Privy Council on the
regulation and control of aeronautics in
Canada:

Inasmuch as the Act embodies a compromise
under which the original provinces agreed to
federate, it is important to keep in mind that the
preservation of the rights of minorities was a condition on which such minorities entered into the
federation, and the foundation upon which the
whole structure was subsequently erected.
The
process of interpretation as the years go on ought
not to be allowed to dim or to whittle down the
provisions of the original contract upon which the
federation was founded, nor is it legitimate that
any judicial construction of the provisions of sections 91 and 92 should impose a new and different
contract upon the federating bodies.

My other citation is taken from a book written by our friend, Dr. Maurice Ollivier, one
of the law clerks of the House of Commons,
who is considered to be an expert on constitutional law. It Is well known that Dr.
Ollivier is an ardent proponent of our right
through our parliament to amend our constitution.

SENATE
Under the heading Le Canada, Pays souverain, at page 68 he says:

(Translation):
As we will have occasion to prove later
on, the British North America Act is not a
contract; it is a statute of the British parliament; but as i is based on an agreement,
on a compromise, it partakes of that agrecment and of that compromise, so that none of
the privileges granted us under this law may
be taken away without violating the moral
law, the constitutional law and inasmuch as
we are an autonomous nation, the international law. It would constitute an action
similar to that of Germany tearing up the
treaty which guaranteed Belgium's neutrality.

(Text):
I think these citations are suficient to support
my view that the provinces are entitled to
be consulted before passing this bill, because
they have been deprived of a right by the
last decision of the Privy Couneil giving this
parliament the power to abolish our appeals
to this same Privy Council. This I will try
to prove.
In presenting this bill, the Minister of
Justice stated that according to decisions of
the Privy Council there were three constitutional bars preventing our parliament from
effectively exercising its power to create a
court of last resort in Canada. The first bar
was the Colonial Laws Validity Act, the
second bar vas the legal doctrine of extraterritoriality, and the third bar consisted of
the express terms of section 129 of the British
North Amierica Act itself.
I read now from page 70 of Hansard of
September 20, 1949:

The third constitutional bar was the express
terms of section 129 of the British North America
Act itself. This section provided that ail the laws
in force at the time of confederation, in Upper
Canada, Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia, should continue, subject to repeal or
amendment by the parliament of Canada or by
the respective provincial legislatures. But this section specifically excepted imperial laws-that is,
laws of the United Kingdom-in force in these four
Therefore, since the
provinces at confederation.
right of appeal from these provinces to the Privy
Council had been legislated upon by the United
Kingdom parliament, it followed that this right
of appeal was specifically excepted from this section 129 of the British North America Act; and
that the Parliament of Canada was not considered
competent to abolish it.

Now we come to the Statute of Westminster, 1931, section 2, subsection 1 of which
provides:

The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, shall not
apply to any law made after the commencement
of this Act by the parliament of a dominion.

Thus the first constitutional bar mentioned
by the Minister of Justice disappeared.
Section 3 reads:
It is hereby declared and enacted that the parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws
having extra-territorial operation.

Thereby the second constitutional bar
disappeared.
Sections 4, 5 and 6 define the powers of
dominion parliament in relation to merchant
shipping and Courts of Admiralty.
It is curious that no special mention is
made of appeals to the Privy Council.
Section 7 covered the rights of the provinces, and reads as follows:
7. (1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to
apply to the repeal amendment or alteration of the
British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any
order, rule or regulation made thereunder.
(2) The provisions of section two of this Act
shall extend to laws made by any of the provinces
of Canada and to the powers of the legislatures of
such provinces.
(3) The powers conferred by this Act upon the
Parliament of Canada or upon the legislatures of
the provinces shall be restricted to the enactment
of laws in relation to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada or of any of
the legislatures of the provinces respectively.

Section 129 of the British North America
Act remained in full force, and the third constitutional bar mentioned by the Minister of
Justice had not disappeared.
Then came the Cahan Bill, the reference
to the Supreme Court, and the judgment of
that court upholding the right of our parliament to make the Supreme Court a final
court for Canada, thus abolishing the right
of appeals to the Privy Council. The decision was not unanimous, as it would have
been if the law had been so clear that no
doubt existed. Four judges were in favour
of giving our government the required power,
one judge was against it, and the other was
partially against it.
Appeal was made against that judgment to
the Privy Council. We know the result. The
decision was that parliament has the power
to abolish appeals by the provinces to the
It does not matter if that
Privy Council.
judgment is to anyone's liking or not; it is
final. No matter if anyone prefers one court
to the other, the fact is that the provinces
have lost one of the most important prerogatives that they enjoyed.
Certain parts of that judgment are interesting, but I will cite only a part which
was mentioned by the Minister of Justice:
Giving full weight to the circumstances of the
union and to the determination shown by the provinces as late as the Imperial conferences, which led
to the Statute of Westminster, that their rights
should be unimpaired, nevertheless ...

This shows that to the last the provinces were
insisting on their rights, and wanted to retain
the protection they thought they had.
But it is useless to argue further. I am
satisfied that I have proven my point: the
provinces have lost something which they
had had since the passing of the British
North America Act, and which was embodied
in the Statutes of Westminster, under clause
7 of that act.

OCTOBER 26, 1949
Honourable senators will recall that a few
years ago I had the privilege of addressing
them on the powers and duties of the Senate.
I will not repeat now what I said at that
time. When listening to the address of the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) I was glad to hear him
mention the late Eugène Lafleur, Aimé
Geoffrion and John Ewart as having been
among the famous lawyers who adorned the
Canadian Bar. In 1918 those three barristers
made a report to a committee of this house
on the powers of the Senate.
Time and again we have been told in this
chamber of the purposes in creating the
Senate: that it was intended to be a body
independent of any political influence, to be
a safeguard against hasty legislation, to protect the minorities, and more specially to
represent the provinces. I will not go over
all that, because honourable senators know
more about it than I do. But I wish to read
these few words from the report of the three
famous lawyers:
To these reasons might be added
sideration, that there is very littie
the Lords and the Senate. The
themselves, the Senate represents

this further conanalogy between
Lords represent
the provinces.

The Senate represents the provinces. These
words are not from the lips of any senator;
they were pronounced by the ablest lawyers
in Canada in 1918.
The provinces have lost a right to which
they were clinging as a safeguard against
encroachments by the federal government.
What are the provinces demanding now?
They are asking that this legislation be postponed until there is a conference with the
federal government to consider and discuss
the proposed amendments to the constitution
under which we have lived since 1867. In
my humble opinion, that request should be
granted. If we are the representatives of
the provinces, and if they feel they have a
reason to complain and are seeking, not to
prevent necessary amendments to our Act,
but simply to get an opportunity to come
to some understanding with the federal
government on the terms of these amendments, it is up to the Senate to stand behind
their request.
These are my reasons for opposing, not
the bill, but its passing at the present time.
A few months' delay in the amendment of a
statute that has existed for years will not
hurt the country; and since we hear so much
about unity, it is time to prove that we
really wish it preserved.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate
was adjourned.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order: Second reading of Bill Z-3,
an Act to amend the Export and Import
Permits Act.-Hon. Mr. Robertson.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to move the
second reading and explain the bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill, designed to continue the provisions of the Export and Import Permits
Act for a period of two more years-that is,
until the 31st of March, 1952. I had the
honour of explaining the original measure
in 1947, and also the 1948 bill which extended
the period of operation of the Act until
March 31, 1950. The only object of the
present bill is to extend the period of operation for a further two years.
As honourable senators are aware, the
purpose of the measure is to allow the
Governor in Council to impose restrictions
upon the importation and the exportation of
certain articles of commerce. He is restricted
in his application of these controls under
the legislation itself. Materials whose export
from Canada may be controlled are of only
three classes: firstly, war materials; secondly,
materials which are not in adequate supply
and distribution in Canada; and thirdly,
materials subject to inter-governmental control and with respect to which this government has undertaken with other governments
to restrict their export. Similarly, the Act
contains restrictions with regard to materials
the importation of which can be forbidden.
Those are confined to articles of which there
is a scarcity in world markets, to articles
which are subjected to governmental control
in their countries of origin, and to articles
which are the subject of international allocation by international bodies.
In February 1948, when I explained the
measure to this house, I gave figures showing
the number of articles which as of December
31, 1947, were subject to import control and
to export control, respectively. The number
of articles subject to export control as at
that date were 520. As of July 20 last the
number of such articles had been reduced to
137.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Could those controls be
reimposed? I refer to the original 500 articles
which were under control for export purposes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have also in mind the
list of items which last July was reduced to
the figure you mentioned.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The figure is 137.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Are the items which constitute the difference between 500 and 137
permanently off control, or can the control
be reimposed?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It could be reimposed,
provided the items are subject to the conditions prescribed by the legislation, international allocation or some like factor. During
the past year and a half what has actually
happened is that the number of articles subject to export control in this country bas been
cut by about 75 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Were those reductions by
order in council or otherwise?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I presume by order in
council. When articles come into free supply,
and there is no apparent necessity to subject
therm to export control, the policy has been
to remove them from the list.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am very much interested
in knowing why controls are being continued
at all.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I will try to answer my
honourable friend in a few moments.
When I spoke on this subject last, in 1948,
there were 67 commodities subject to import
control in Canada; as of the 20th of July last,
that number has been reduced to 5. The
general purview of this bill, in respect of
articles subject to control, has been very
substantially reduced.
I should like now to answer briefly the
question by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). His question was: Why are
any controls still necessary? First, the only
materials of any real importance which are
still subject to export control are materials of
war, and they are controlled for strategic
reasons. Second, and a rather important
reason why war materials from this country
should be subject to control, the United States
has a very stringent export control on strategic materials from that country to every
other country in the world, except Canada.
It allows Canada to import such articles without any restriction. It is therefore necessary
that our government have the power to
impose export controls on such articles, so as
to prevent them from being imported into
Canada and then channelled through to other
countries, in this way accomplishing something which would be impossible if it were
sought to export them directly from the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable gentleman give as many as he can of the 137
articles which come within the restrictions?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I cannot very well go
over each single item, but I shall give the
classifications into which they fall, if that is
satisfactory to my friend. I presume this bill
will be referred to a committee, at which
time the officers of the department will be
available to give explanations and details of
why any particular article on the list is
subject to export control. For the moment,
the various groups are as follows:
Group 1-Agriculture and vegetable products.
Group 2-Animals and animal products.
Group 3-Fibres, textiles and textile products.
Group 4-Wood and wood products.
Hon. Mr. Haig: None of those headings
includes war materials.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, particular articles
may be included, but I will shortly send the
whole list over to my honourable friend. It
continues:
Group 5-Iron and steel (including alloy
steel) and their products.
Group 6-Non-ferrous metals and their products.
Group 7-Non-metallic metals, chemicals and
their products.
Group 8-Arms, ammunition, implements or
munitions of war; military, naval
or air stores.
With regard to the limitations upon imports,
there are, as I have said, only five articles
subject to restriction at the present moment,
and those are all subject to international
allocation by some international body or
other, which is the only reason why it is
necessary for our government to control their
import.
Hon. Mr. Euler: As the list is small, could
mv friend read it?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The articles consist of
powdered rnilk, rice, tin and scrap iron and
steel. I beg my honourable friend's pardon,
there appear to be only four.
I am informed that the reason for control
on the importation of rice is that the commodity is in very short world supply, and that
its distribution among different countries of
the world is controlled by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations. As regards tin, my information is
that its supply to the world is under the
control of the Combined Tin Committee.
Honourable senators, those are the explanations which have been given to me concerning the reasons for the continuation of these
controls.

OCTOBER 26, 1949
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Are we to understand that
the export of farm products is under the
control of this Act?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: As I understand it, because
of an agreement made between Canada and
the United States, farm products are controlled by the general law. If that is the
case, why should those products come under
this Act at all?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Does my honourable
friend refer to agriculture and vegetable products, or to animals and animal products?
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I refer to agricultural
products.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The only products of
agriculture subject to export control at the
moment are, Item 1: Cereal and bakery products, comprising biscuits, breakfast cereals,
and macaroni. Incidentally, I am frank to
say that I do not know why macaroni is
included in that list. Item 2 covers grains
and grain products, including barley, oats,
rye, wheat of various kinds, mixed feeds of
all kinds, rice and screenings of any grain
or flaxseed. I presume that wheat is subject
to export control in order to enable this
country to fulfil its obligations to Great
Britain in accordance with the wheat agreement between that country and Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And by order in council, not
by legislation, we are being deprived of a
market for wheat at a price much higher than
we could get elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. This does not
involve a prohibition of export. All the Act
says is that the export of these articles must
be subject to the approval of the Governor
in Council-

worth of gift parcels which are sent to Britain
every year, among which there are bound to
be tons of breakfast cereal?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I cannot answer my
honourable friend's question directly, but I
think that the export of gift parcels to England
is provided for under other legislation.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
do not intend to speak at any length on this
subject, but I must say that I, sitting in this
house as a Progressive Conservative, can
scarcely believe my ears when I hear the
government introduce a bill of this nature
after the war has been over for more than
four years, at a time when we are trying
desperately to sell our goods to the world.
Three-eighths of everything Canada produces
has to be sold to the world. For several
years we were held up on the export of
cattle to the United States. It is true that
in 1948 we were allowed to go into that
market, and benefited largely as a result. I
can understand the necessity for controlling
war materials, which is about the last group
on the list; I can understand, too, that certain
products subject to international allocation
should be controlled. I note that at a recent
conference the British Government representatives, to aid the output of mines within
their sphere of interest, urged the United
States to buy more tin. But how can a Liberal
government sponsor a measure of this kind
more than four years after the war, when our
country is straining every nerve to sell goods
to the world, and when, if I read the press
reports correctly, some members of the British
House of Commons are saying that Britain
has been keeping up going by buying our
wheat, and that if certain conditions are not
fulfilled those purchases cannot continue? I

they think these things out. The only explanation which occurs to me is that a long period
of office has so stunted their mental processes
that they cannot remember what their platform was in the days gone by; that they have
lost track of their old policies. I am almost
persuaded that some honourable members of
this house were not alive in 1919, when the
famous Liberal platform was brought down.
If they were, they have forgotten what it
contained. I am not a philanthropist, but I
would be prepared to ask someone to reprint
that platform and send a copy to every
honourable gentleman on the other side, so
that he may know what, in the days of their
opposition, the Liberal party in this country
promised to do.
When I asked my honourable friend to
name the articles which come within the
military restrictions, he enumerated several
classifications, including agricultural products.

put restrictions on it. Butter is on the list,
yet we are loaded to the eyes with butter.
We lost $9 million on a little deal in it made
by the government about eight months ago.
I do not know what stimulates honourable
gentlemen opposite to fight for such a bill.
I cannot understand how my honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) can stand that kind of politics.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I have been doing my best
to get some of these restrictions removed,
but my honourable friend is against me on
that matter as well as others.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would like to undertake to help my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have not finished. I
thought my honourable friend wanted to ask
me a question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will compose myself
in patience.
Mr. Haig: There is no hurry. We have
plenty of lime to consider this bill, and I am
in no ha'te to have it go to committee. But
when it does go to committee-whose department has to do with this? Trade and Commerce?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the minister is a good
explainer, and it will be very nice to have
him there trying to make an explanation.
I am neither a prophet nor the son of a
prophet, but I tell the honourable senator
from Inkerman that, though this bill may be
passed, in my opinion it will be inoperative
before the two years are up and all its restrictions except those relating to war materials
will disappear. I suggest further that two
years hence, instead of demanding restricthe government will be looking
tions,
desperately for markets. Already the Englishman is saying "If you want to sell us your
wheat, cattle, hogs, butter or cheese you have
got to buy our goods." But what about the
people in our country who make manufactured goods? The government does not seem
to think about them. In my small province,
in the city of Winnipeg, there are people
eng ageJ in manufacturing articles with which
British imports are in competition. Already
many of our garment workers are in receipt
of unemployment pay. They accuse the merchants of caballing against them. That sort
of thing is going to happen all over this
country. The editor of the Frec Press, a Winnipeg publication of some note, is telling us
that the farmers, the fishermen and the forest
producers should come first. But if their
interests are to be preferred, what is to
happen to the workers in our cities, towns
and villages, especially in Ontario and
Quebec?
A veek or two ago I ask ed the leader of
the govcrnment here what it was intended to
no as a result of devaluation. To date he bas
been just as heipful as his colleagues in the
other place, who have not given any answerand neither lias he. I am not saying there is

Our difficulty is that we have so restricted
our selling ihat some of our very best
customers have been lost.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Why not take restrictions
off imports and have free trade?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I expect you will do that.
But now you are going the other way.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I agree with you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad that the honourable member for Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff)
realizes the import of this bill, and I hope
that when it gets to committee be will join
me in trying to find out why it is necessary
to impose any restrictions, excepting those on
war materials or those affected by interCertainly the sale of

OCTOBER 26, 1949
Hon. Mr. Duff: In opposing restrictions, do
you include imports as well as exports?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is only one item
which affects imports.
Hon. Mr. Duff: If you are going to be a
Grit, be a good one.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The way things are now, I
don't know where I stand. I was brought up
to believe that we should allow our people
to sell their goods any place in the world
that they wanted to.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was also taught that if we
wanted to build a sturdy nation in Canada we
had to diversify our industries all over this
country. I say quite candidly that my experiences during the wars of 1914-1918 and 19391949 have taught me that those who advocated a certain amount of industrial development in this country were not indulging in a
waste of words, because we certainly did a
great job in the line of industrial production,
particularly during the last war. So I am
wary about drifting away from a safe anchorage, something I know about, to moorings of
which I know nothing. My Liberal friends,
who are now bringing in restrictions and
controls, might accuse my party of voting to
keep foreign goods from coming in, but I do
not think it can be said that we ever tried to
prevent our goods from going out. Yet my
honourable friends opposite are doing both
things-why, I don't know.
I am willing, in fact I am delighted that
this bill should go into committee, but I
would ask the minister whose department this
bill affects, when he has read the platform of
the Liberal party-either that of August 1948
or of August 1949, or both-why it is necessary four years after the war to restrict the
export of one hundred and forty-seven
articles. I would like to know.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am keenly interested in the argument advanced by my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), and his apparent
inability to grasp the reasons behind the
presentation of this legislation. Employing
the skill with which he is so well equipped,
he of course picked one particular item from
among many which my honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) endeavoured to cover.
I do not propose to give any explanation
now, because information may be secured on
any particular item; but on the point raised
by my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), that this legislation is completely at
variance with Liberal principles and ideas,
I want to say to him that since the war the
administration of my party has had one

dominating thought-the general welfare of
the whole community.
Further, in its
endeavours to accomplish this end, I would
suggest to my honourable friend that the
record of the Liberal government during this
period will never suffer by comparison with
that of the government with which he was
associated after the First Great War. I
remember the predictions made by my honourable friend opposite as to what would
happen a year or two after the late war if
the then government was continued in office;
but I want to ask honourable gentlemen
opposite-who are radiating apparent affluence, good spirits and happiness-if they are
not themselves enjoying the prosperity and
success which has attended the efforts of this
government? There has never been a government in Canada which has produced better results than the present one so far as the
welfare of all classes is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is the same old
story.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would remind my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Horner) that the
proof of the pudding is in the eating. The
community which he represents was never as
prosperous as it is today.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would be a lot better
off if I were allowed to sell my wheat at the
right price.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friends
were never so well off as they are today, and
Canada's business interests were never in a
better position to face the future. Our individual savings are higher and the country's
finances are better in every way, shape and
form.
Hon. Mr. Leger: You can say we have
never been taxed as much as we are today.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The far-sighted administration of our government as it has related
to all phases of Canadian business in the
years since the war is at complete variance
with the administration of the Conservative
party in the years following the first war.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You might add that we
have never been taxed so high.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And we never had so
much money with which to pay our taxes.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I am quite sure my colleagues in this house
will not be surprised to hear me make a few
observations on this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I had hoped you would.

Hon. Mr. Howard: Especially since you
were pointed out.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Before I do so, may I, as
an old believer in freedom and liberty,
wholeheartedly welcome the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) to our ranks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: By bis speech this afternoon he has shown that he has become a
flaming apostle of freedom and of liberty;
and those who believe in these great principles must welcome him into their midst. But

Hon. Mr. Crerar: -conversion to the support of these great principles is doubly

he does today.
Honourable senators, by the creation of the
Wheat Board for the marketing of grain, the
honourable Mr. Bennett introduced one of the
first controls of the kind ever to be imposed
in Canada. I did not hear my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) offer any criticism of
Mr. Bennett's action at that time. In fact, if
my memory serves me right, my honourable
friend, as was his privilege, supported that
platform during the election of 1935. I do
not offer this as undue criticism of my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me correct my honourable friend frorn Churchill. Since then,
thanks to Mr. Bennett, I have become a
member of the Senate.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There was a time, and I
am afraid it was a long time ago, when by
customs tariffs-for which I have never had
much use-the importer and the citizen knew
what handicap he was under when he
attempted to import goods; but today, by
various regulations, restrictions and other
devices, the average citizen does not know
where he stands when it comes to the
importation of goods.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I submit that this is a distinct barrier to the development of our international trade, which is of the very highest
importance.
Hon. Mr. Duff: You are quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When we look around the
world today and see the conditions with
which we may be faced, does it help a
Canadian merchant, when exporting a commodity, to have to approach an official of
some board in order to get permission to do
so? Does it help if the individual citizen has
to go to some public authority here in Ottawa
or elsew'here and get permission to import,
for instance, an automobile from the United
States?
Hon. Mr. Euler: And be refused.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is not under this

restrictions and controls the sooner will there
be a chance of our moving forward into
better times and better conditions.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If no other honourable
member desires to speak I will close the
debate. I do not know that there is much
I can say in reply.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Move the six months' hoist.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I fully agree with the
statement made by a number of honourable
members, that the sooner we get away from
these controls the better, and I think the
government is doing a fairly good job in
getting away from them.
Some honourable senators who spoke would
appear to have forgotten the figures I gave
in my introductory remarks. In the last
eighteen months the number of commodities
subject to export control has been reduced
from 542 to 137; and in the same period
the number of commodities subject to import
control has been reduced from 67 to 4. So
I think it can be said that in administering
this Act the government has been fully
conscious of the necessity to remove as soon
as possible as many articles of trade as it
can from the requirements of import or
export control.
In my enumeration of the different classes
of articles subject to export control I may
have misled my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). For instance,
when I referred to animals and animal products I did not mean that all kinds of animals
and all kinds of animal products were subject
to export control, but only those classes of
animals and animal products which are
specified in this list.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will my honourable
friend state which ones are not subject to
control?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I can give the information in part. In doing so I perhaps might
support the statement of my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) as to the care
with which the government has been looking
after the affairs of the nation. For instance,
there is a restriction on the export of hogs,
but nevertheless there are certain important
exceptions to that restriction. My honourable friend may not export hogs, as hogs,
but he may freely export brains, casings,
ears, feet, hearts, hog brains, bungs, hog
bung caps, kidneys, livers, scalps, skins,
snouts, stomachs and tails.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Things we do not want
for ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Duff: What about the squeal?

Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is a very impressive
list, but may I ask my honourable friend
another question?
Under this legislation
would the government not have power to reimpose export restrictions on any of these
articles?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, but only subject
to the conditions imposed in the legislation
itself. In other words, the government could
not reimpose export control on any article
unless there was such a shortage of that
article in Canada that restriction of export
was deemed necessary, or unless restriction
was made necessary by international allocation, or unless there was some other condition which the Act recognizes as justifying
restriction.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It seems to be the desire of
most members of the Senate and of the
general public that these restrictions be
removed just as soon as possible. That being
so, I am curious as to why the authority to
restrict exports and imports is to be extended
in this instance for two years instead of for
only one year, as before.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
is incorrect as to the previous extension. That
was passed at the session of 1948, and was
for a period of two years, the same as is asked
for in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is too long.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would suggest to the
honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) that he request not only the
Departient of Trade and Commerce but the
Department of Agriculture as well to have
appropriate officials present when this bill is
considered in committee. I make this suggestion because it is quite clear that the major
items for which export permits are necessary
are commodities which today are covered by
bilateral trade agreements, food agreements.
Most of those agreements, I believe, expire
in 1950, but so long as they exist they require
a series of permits. Representatives of the
Department of Agriculture should be present
to tell us what supplies of various foods are
on hand. I am thinking particularly of cheese,
butter and eggs, because I definitely know
that surpluses of these commodities have been
held in storage in this country against the
obligations of food treaties, although they
could have been more profitably sold elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen I think my honourable
friend's suggestion is a very valuable one.
I quite agree that in the circumstances we
should require the presence at our committee
of the appropriate officials from not only the
Department of Trade and Commerce but also
from the Department of Agriculture.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am interested in a question raised a few moments ago by my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
as to the power of the government to reimpose controls. Who decides whether the conditions that exist warrant the imposition of
control on a specific commodity? Is it not the
government who decided that?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The explanatory note, as
one reason for extending the life of the Act,
says that import control is required with
regard to goods that are subject to price
support. It seems to me perfectly reasonable
that if the government is paying out subsidies
to support the prices of certain goods there
should be some control over the import of

those goods.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But we are dealing with
exports.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Both.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But principally exports.

NATIONAL TRADE MARK AND TRUE
LABELLING BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order: Second reading of Bill A-4,
an Act respecting the apolication of a national
trade mark to commodities and respecting
the true descriptions of commodities.-Hon.
Mr. Robertson.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbel) to move second
reading and explain this bill. I may say that
a similar bill was introduced here last session
and, after having been amended in com-

mittee, was passed and sent to another place,
but parliament was dissolved before the bill
had been fully dealt with there.
Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the
reading of the bill.

second

He said: Honourable senators, this measure
is similar to a bill which was before parliament last session. That bill was given first
and second readings here, was considered in
the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
which amended il and returned it to the
house, where il was read the third time and
passed and was sent to the other place. Unfortunately, parliament dissolved before il could

be considered there. Hence it is necessary
to reintroduce the measure. For the benefit
of honourable senators who were not present
when the subject matter was explained before,
I shall take a few minutes to outline the
proposed legislation.
This is not in any way new legislation, its
objectives already being covered by the
Dominion Trade and Industry Commission
Act, 1935, chapter 39, which provides for a
national trade mark and the setting up of a
commission to function under the Act. That
arrangement, however, was found to be
unsatisfactory, and the powers of the commission were transferred to the Department
of Trade and Commerce, to be vested in the
minister.
Since that amendment, I think in 1939, a
number of firms have asked permission to
use the national trade mark. Under the
existing Act it was not considered feasible
to grant this permission for the reason that
once it had been granted there was not sufficient control vested in the minister or in the
Governor in Council to cancel the privilege
in the event of goods bearing the trade mark
not meeting the required standards when sold
or offered for sale.
The bill now before us provides a workable

measure to deal with three specific subjects.
First, the use of the words "Canada Standard"
or the initials "C.S." as the national trade
mark; second, the establishment of commodity standards for products to which the
national trade mark may be applied; and
third, accurate labelling of commodities.
Dealing first with the use of the national
trade mark, I may say that its use is wholly
voluntary. Any industrial firm or individual
engaged in trade and commerce can apply
for the privilege of using the national trade
mark.
When this application is made a
sample of the goods to which it is proposed to
attach the national trade mark must be submitted for inspection. If the goods meet the
required standards permission to use the
trade mark is given. The bill provides that
should the goods at any time fall below the
required standard, the trade mark may be
As I have said, the use of the
cancelled.
trade mark is voluntary, there being nothing
compulsory about il, except to maintain the
standard of quality once permission to use
the trade mark is granted.
On the question of the establishment of
commodity standards to which the trade
mark may be applied, I may say that existing
legislation authorizes the setting of standards
for any goods offered for sale. The proposed
measure makes no such provision except for
goods as to which permission to use the
national trade mark is sought and given.

OCTOBER 26, 1949
As ta the accurate labelling, the bill provides that when a persan offers his commodities for sale and labels themn ini such a way
as to induce people to buy because of their
reliance on statements appearing an the label,
those statements must be true and accurate.
The bil also provides that infringements
of the regulations shaîl be subi ect to penalties.
In view of the fact that this measure is
exactly the same as the one passed by this
house, after amnendment, last session, I arn
wondering whether honourable senators wil
feel that it should be referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Have those amendments
been incorporated in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. I arn informed
that the bill is an exact duplicate of the one
that passed this house last year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No change whatsoever?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No change whatsoever.
It may be that honourable senators may wish
ta hear officials from the department, or ta
examine the praposed legislation more carefully in committee. However, as it is an
exact duplicate of the previaus bill, 1 should
nat think it need be referred ta committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Are there any complaints
an record since last session?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I understand there are
no camplaints. Various parties were heard
last year, and no objection was taken ta the
measure.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 6
FIRST READING
A Message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 118, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1950.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read a second time.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: With leave
of the Senate, now.
When the last interim supply bill was
before us, the Senate was given a review
of all the supply voted in the last session
of the preceding parliament. I propose now
to mention it only briefly. Prior to the dissolution of the last parliament six-twelfths of
the general estimates had been voted. in
certain instances additional sums over and
above the six-twelfths were voted. These
were cases in which the additional expenditures were required at the beginning of the
fiscal year. At the same time parliament
voted one-sixth of the supplementary estimates for Newfoundland. As was the case
in the general estimates, certain sums in
addition to the six-twelfths were voted. Last
month we voted one-twelfth of the general
estimates, one-twelfth of the Newfoundland
supplementary estimates, one-twelfth of the
further supplementary estimates, and certain
additional sums that were required in special
cases.
The bill before us, honourable senators,
which in form is practically the same as the
one presented in October, asks for a further
one-twelfth of the general estimates, onetwelfth of the Newfoundland supplementary

estimates, one-twelfth of the further supplementary estimates, and certain additional
sums for special cases.
By section 2 of the bill it is sought to vote
one-twelfth of the general estimates, with
the exception of three items, the present
requirements of which have been met, thus
making it unnecessary to ask for additional
amounts.
The purpose of section 3 is to vote threetwelfths of item 559 in addition to the onetwelfth voted under section 2. The explanation of this vote is contained in schedule A.
On November 1 of this year certain bonds in
relation to the Montreal harbour fall due,
and this sum is required to retire them. As
regards this item, I confess, in anticipation
of being questioned about it, that I am not
quite clear at the moment why items relating
to the retiring of maturing bonds appear both
under schedule A and schedule B. I have not
been able yet to secure a precise explanation.
When introducing the item in the other place,
the minister said that it was the result of a
failure to anticipate exactly the amount that
would be required up to the end of November
for the maturing bonds. He did not give any
further explanation, but I take it that it has
to do with the retirement of these bonds and
the necessary amount to take care of them.
Hon. Mr. Duff: May I ask the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if copies of Bill
118 are available to honourable senators?
Hon. Mr. Howden: Yes, there is a copy of
the bill in your file.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Section 4 would vote
one-twelfth of the supplernentary estimates
(Newfoundland). Item 681 is excepted because
it has been sufficiently provided for. Section
5 would vote one-twelfth of the further
supplementary estimates. Section 6 would
vote additional nine-twelfths of the amount
of items 779 and 935 in the further supplementary estimates. These items are shown in
Schedule B of the bill. These sums also are
required for the retirement of bonds falling
due on November 1 in relation to Montreal
harbours. That is an item to which I have
already referred.
Item 779, nine-twelfths of which is now contemplated, is for Canada's contribution to the
International Children's Emergency Fund.
The total sum proposed by the bill is
$130,155,283.99. In no case does this bill,
or any other supply bill passed in relation to
the fiscal year 1949-50, vote the total amount
of any item in any of the estimates. The
passage of this bill, of course, in no way
prejudices the right of any senator to discuss
the items dealt with when the general supply
bill comes before us.

OCTOBER 27, 1949
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to indulge in a budget debate.
A speech recently made by the leader of the
opposition in another place appealed to me
most keenly. The pith of it was that parliament ought to try to devise a new way of dealing with estimates so as to make greater
progress with them. I am entirely in agreement with that idea, and if such a policy
could be worked out I think both houses of
parliament could give much better consideration to the estimates. It is now the practice
to refer the railway estimates to a subcommittee, and it is my understanding from
the speech that the agricultural estimates,
public works estimates, and so on, would be
referred to special committees. I know I am
repeating myself-and I do not do so just
for the sake of repetition-when I say that
honourable senators are of little use to the
Parliament of Canada in helping to direct
expenditures. The reason is that the estimates
are not placed before them until the very
last moment. There is no use saying that
we can hold up the estimates and keep the
other place waiting. It is pretty difficult for
one to dictate a letter on some important
matter when seven or eight people are outside
one's office waiting to see one; and, figuratively speaking, the House of Commons is
just outside our door waiting for us to get
through with the estimates. I am wondering
whether at the opening of the next session
the Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Finance could not place a special resolution
on the Order Paper which would authorize us
to consider this question. We could summon
the Finance Department officials before our
committee and ascertain what objections, if
any, they would have to such and such a program. For instance, the rules could be
amended, so that when the other place got
through with the railway estimates a bill
could be brought in and be sent over to us.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: The other house votes
the railway expenditures of the past year, not
railway estimates.

Hon. Mr. Sinclair: But they do not vote
railway estimates in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They will vote this year
to cover a deficit of about $40 million.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: After it is all spent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is gone, but it will be
voted this year.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: That is not an estimate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is an expenditure. That
is what I am talking about. I do not care
whether you call it an estimate or not.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: It is an expenditure, but
you called it an estimate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Every member of this house,
including my honourable friend, knew what
I meant.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: I knew you were wrong.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If we do not do something
along the line I am suggesting, we cannot
render any service at all in that department
of government. And besides, our sessions
could be greatly shortened if the other house
would deal with the estimates in special
or standing committees. Those of us whose
homes are not in Ontario and Quebec-in
other words, who have to stay in Ottawa
week after week and month after month
during' most of the session-know what is
done in another place, because we sit in the
gallery over there and listen for hours at
a time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. Haig: We know that half a dozen
men can keep the bouse engaged on some
item in the estimates all afternoon and all
night, whereas estimates can be dealt with
speedily in a standing or special committee.
May I illustrate by referring to a bill that
we have had before us here this session?
It may not be strictly according to the rules
for me to do so, and I want to avoid hurting
the feelings of my honourable friend from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair).

SENATE
work done than you would in four weeks
of discussion in Committee of the Whole.
I suggest that we should try to discover
some method whereby the other house may
become more efficient in the handling of
estimates or expenditures, and we should
make this effort not only for the sake of
honourable members of that place but for
our own sake as well. I urge the leader
of this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who is
a member of the government, to suggest to
his colleagues that serious consideration be
given to this question.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Honourable senators, this
house has nothing to do with the control of
finances. It may think it has, but the fact
is that it has not. I believe that the last
time an attempt was made by the Senate
to amend a money bill was in 1872. In my
opinion we shall be wasting a lot of time
if we discuss all these estimates, because
from a practical viewpoint-I emphasize the
word "practical"-we in this house have
nothing at ail to do with money bills. If
we go into estimates at all we shall simply
be duplicating work that is done in another
place. I repeat that, whatever we may think,
the fact is that in practice we have not the
power to amend money bills.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
wish to congratulate the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) upon calling attention
to this matter, though this is not the first
occasion within my experience on which the
subject has been discussed in this chamber.
I am astounded at the utter laxity with
which we consider the expenditure of the
taxpayer's money. No county council would
leave to the county officials the responsibilities concerning expenditures which, by al
governments of Canada for many years, have
been left to the civil servants. The estimates
to be brought down are prepared by civil
servants, not by parliament; they are
consented to by the minister concernedundoubtedly they are passed by the cabinetand are then presented on the floor of parliament. Frequently the minister knows so
little about the proposais for expenditures
that he calls on civil servants to sit in front
of him and tell him what they are all about.
I am not criticizing the man; I am criticizing
our system for the approval of expenditures.
In the Congress of the United States there
are appropriation committees, and when it is
proposed to spend money the proposals are
submitted to one of the committees; the officials, who in some way are responsible for the
proposals appear before the committee, and
are cross-examined over the table, as the
leader opposite has suggested should be done
here.

It may be that we in this chamber have
little authority in the matter of expenditures.
It is my understanding, however, that,
although we cannot initiate an expenditure,
we can stop any expenditure we please. I
think the chief reason we refrain from doing
this is that we know very little about the
details involved. If the suggestion that has
been made here today were carried out, and
the various departments presented their proposals to a committee of the House of Commons to be considered around the table, the
debate which follows would be vastly
improved; it would be an informed discussion
and not the rambling debate that takes place
today. I see no reason why representatives
from this house should not sit on such committees with the representatives of the House
of Commons.
At the present time the estimates, which
are proposals for expenditures, are laid before
the house. Apart from those sitting on the
treasury benches, nobody has any inside
information, and the discussion wanders ail
over the lot; anybody may bring up any subject he likes, and the debate is unnecessarily
prolonged. Even the chairman is scarcely in
a position to insist on relevancy. But if
the members had some real knowledge of the
details of the expenditures, and the reasons
for them, those who are expected to take the
responsibility of voting both here and in the
other place, would participate in the discussion, and the debate would be intelligent and
useful to the public.
How such a suggestion as has been made
is to be put into practice, I do not know. I
ani no authority on the question, but I believe
that we should keep the subject alive. For
that reason I congratulate the leader opposite
for bringing it up. Let us have a little more
discussion on it.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators will perhaps recall that when the
supply bill was passed about a month ago
I was not in the house. I did, however, read
the remarks of the leader opposite and others,
and I find no fault with what was said. I
rather anticipated that the question would
come up again today.
I am frank to admit that it is always with
a certain hesitancy that I present the interim
supply bills and the final budget bill. I have,
however, followed the traditional method,
pointing out to the house that in voting
interim supply honourable senators do not
deprive themselves of the opportunity of
raising any question they like in the debate
on the budget. I make that observation knowing full well that, in keeping with the practice, it is very doubtful that there will be
any extensive debate on the budget.

OCTOBER 27, 1949
Generally speaking, when the budget resolutions have been passed, together with ail
the other business, the other place is ready
to call it a day. Whatever rights we in this
house may have to continue the discussion,
as was mentioned by the honourable leader
opposite-and no doubt we have the rightit is very seldom that we take advantage of it.
I heartily agree with the remarks of the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck); but as to the
exact method of implementing the suggestion
made, or the wisdom of my conferring with
my colleagues on the procedure in the House
of Commons, I am not sure. The fact remains
that it is possible for us to inquire into
expenditures
a great deal more than
we have done in the past. On various
occasions we have referred budget questions
to one of our standing committees. In my
time here it has been done on one or two
occasions, and I think it was done several
times previously.
In anticipation of the discussion on this
subject, I brought to my desk this afternoon
a resolution which I am content either to
move now and ask for concurrence of the
Senate, or to hand in as a notice of motion.
At this stage of the session it might be practical to implement such a resolution.
The resolution contemplates that those who
are interested in budget questions will ask
to have witnesses called and arrangements
made for their attendance. In this respect
I must always keep in mind the fact that
the committees of this bouse, particularly the
Divorce Committee-in the work of which
both the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) take
an active part-are very busy. I think
perhaps the Divorce Committee bas pretty
well concluded its business; therefore this
may be an appropriate time to bring forward
the proposal, however imperfect it may be.
I will not now move the resolution, but shall
read it to the bouse, and if it is the desire
of honourable senators, I will give notice of
motion. It reads as follows:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed by the
estimates laid before parliament, and by budget and
other resolutions relating to proposed financial
measures of which notice has been given to parliament, in advance of the bills based on the said
estimates and resolutions reaching the Senate.

As I have said, honourable senators, I anticipated criticism similar to those expressed
a month ago, and I can find no fault with
them. Constitutionally, it is within our
ability to reduce expenditures if we see fit.
I have just been handed a document
entitled "Rights of the Senate in matters of
45785-13

Financial Legislation", prepared in 1918 by
the Honourable W. B. Ross, K.C. The first
clause of its conclusions reads as follows:
That the Senate of Canada has and always had
since it was created, the power to amend bills originating in the Commons appropriating any part of
the revenue or imposing a tax by reducing the
amounts therein, but has not the right to increase
the same without the consent of the Crown.

Whether or not we shall do that is a matter
for consideration.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask what was
the reference?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The reference is to
the report of the special committee appointed
to determine the rights of the Senate in matters of financial legislation. The chairman
was the Hon. W. B. Ross, K.C., and the document is dated Thursday, May 9, 1918.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Do the names of the
other members appear?
Hon. Mr. Hardy: May I ask the honourable
leader if the Senate has ever attempted to
follow the conclusions as to its rights which
were set out in the report?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Not in my time.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Not since 1873.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, they did. They cut
down the railroad appropriations in one case,
and defeated the bill which contained them.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I assume that the leader
of the government is discussing the question
of consideration by a committee of the estimates, after they are brought down. If I
correctly understood the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), his suggestion was that
the estimates should be considered by a
committee before they were put before the
house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Davies: And the estimates, I take
it, are part of the government's policy.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: On the question of the
propriety of referring to a committee estimates or budget resolutions which have not
formally come to us, the senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) will appreciate that
in practice the actual estimates and the budget
resolutions do not formally come before us
until the last day or two of the session. I
suggest that, if we wish to avail ourselves of
this right, the appropriate procedure is to
move to refer the estimates to a committee,
where any senators can ask that witnesses
be called and heard as to any item on which
information is required. Whether, following
that proceeding, any honourable senator would
see fit to move to reduce the amount of the
estimates is a matter of detail. Certainly it

SENATE
bas never happened in my time, and perhaps,
as was observed by my honourable friend
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), for a long time
before that. But I do not think there is
any question about our right so to act if we
sec fit. I am prepared to facilitate such
action in this way. I think we have reached
a stage of business at which a motion to this
effect could be acted upon next week without
interfering very much with the other business of the house. Of course, for it to be
effective, there must be an adequate attendance and a reasonable amount of time
devoted to the matter.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish to make one reference to the debate. All of us, I believe, will
remember that the distinguished senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) introduced
this system during the war years. It did not
help us a great deal, because the amount
of the military estimates was practically fixed,
and we could not change it.
Hon. Mr. King: We got a lot of information,
though.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, sir.
Hon. Mr. King: From ministers.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Useful information. As far
as I know, the honourable senator from
Kootenay East originated the idea, and it
worked very satisfactorily.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

PRESS REPORT
PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, I rise to a question of privilege. I wish to call the attention of honourable senators to a thoroughly stupid and
unreliable article printed in this morning's
Ottawa Citizen. It appears in the first column
of the front page, and with leave of the
Senate I should like to read the article now
in case some honourable senators have not
seen it. It is headed "Senate Reminded Newfoundland Part Of Canada" and is as follows:
The Senate was taken to task in Commons yesterday for being out of date.
The Speaker told the bouse about a bill from the
Red Chamber entitled "An Act Respecting the British and Foreign Bible Society in Canada and Newfoundland."
A. L. Smith, Progressive Conservative from Calgary West, reminded that Newfoundland was a part
of Canada now.
"I think the bill should be referred back to them
and they should be told to get their English
straight," he said.

I

am

informed

that

this

article

was

despatched clear across Canada by the Canadian Press. It is so inaccurate and stupid
that in my opinion it reflects on the Senate,
and I should like to associate myself with
the sentiments of the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) who recently
protested against the continual belittling of
this body.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) to explain why he considers the
article stupid, and so on?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: The purpose of the bill
is to delete the words "and Newfoundland"
because Newfoundland is now part of Canada.
The Senate is well aware that Newfoundland
is part of Canada. The article reflects on the
members of another place, because they
evidently had not read the bill.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I did not see the article.
Does it carry the Canadian Press date line?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I made inquiries from
the Ottawa Citizen, and was advised that
it was not responsible for the article. The
newspaper claimed that the article had been
forwarded to it by the Canadian Press.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do the letters "C.P."
precede the article?

OCTOBER 27, 1949
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I may be permitted, perhaps I could give a further explanation.
When a bill is introduced either here or in
the other chamber it carries its old title.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The old title appeared on
this bill-"An Act Respecting the British and
Foreign Bible Society in Canada and Newfoundland"-and when the bill is finally
passed the words "and Newfoundland" will
be struck out. Perhaps I am stupid myself,
because I made a similar mistake some years
ago. I raised quite a racket about it in committee, and the Clerk of the Senate took me
aside and judiciously informed me how wrong
I was. I am not trying to excuse the other
bouse, but I want honourable senators to
know what is involved.
PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF FEES
Hon. Mr. Paterson moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon the Bill
Y-3, intituled: "An Act respecting the British and
Foreign Bible Society in Canada and Newfoundland"
be refunded to Mr. Russell M. Dick, K.C., counsel
for the petitioner, less printing and translation
costs.

The motion was agreed to.
DIVORCE BILLS
THIRD READINGS

Hon. Mr. Aselline (Chairman of the Standing Committee on Divorce) moved the third
readings of the following bills:
Bill N-4, an Act for the relief of Cicely
Manley Sampson.
Bill 0-4, an Act for the relief of Paul
Paquette.
Bill P-4, an Act for the relief of Joseph
Simon Adelard Barrette.

Pollock Harris.
Bill S-4, an Act for the relief of Sonia
Eagle Davies.
Bill T-4, an Act for the relief of Evelyne
Louis Steinwold.
Bill U-4, an Act for the relief of John
Gilbert Speak.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.

Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators, I
had not intended taking part in this debate
until yesterday, when my attention was
directed to a speech made by the leader of
the Social Credit group in the other place
on the Address to be presented to Rio
Majesty the King on the amendment to the
British North America Act. If other members from Alberta remained silent, the public
might form the opinion that the leader of
the Social Credit party was expressing what
was in the minds of Albertans generally. I
am speaking now because I should not like
to see that opinion go abroad uncontradicted,
and I shall refer more particularly to his
speech before I resume my seat.
Honourable senators, the British North
America Act was designed to be a framework of government, outlining in the broadest
and most comprehensive manner possible, the
fundamental law of the constitution of Canada
and its provinces. It confers upon the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority
with respect to all questions of common concern to all the people of Canada; it confers
upon the provinces exclusive legislative
authority in all matters of a local or private
nature. The Parliament of Canada has no
right whatever to legislate on matters which
were allocated to provincial authority; on
the other hand, the legislature of any province bas no authority to legislate on matters
allocated to federal authority.
Should a province feel that parliament is
legislating on matters assigned to the provinces, and a contest arises, the courts have to
decide which contestant is in the right and
which contestant is in the wrong. That has
been the procedure in the past, and notwithstanding the fact that we are abolishing
appeals to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, that will continue to be the
procedure in the future. But the Supreme
Court of Canada will be our final court of
appeal. I have great faith in the Supreme
Court of Canada and I am very glad to have
a voice in and a vote towards making it our
final court of appeal.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I have much more faith in
it than bas the Social Credit party in Canada.
Their leader, in speaking for his group, in the
speech to which I have already referred, said:
It is our belief that the resolution should not be
passed until the Supreme Court of Canada ...

The Hon. the Speaker: I would point out

Mr. Ross) that one of the rules of the Senate

SUPREME COURT BILL

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: Nobody is objecting.
Hon. Mr. Copp: The honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) can summarize
it in his own words.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I am not criticising anyone.
Another speaker in another place had this
to sayThe Hon. the Speaker: The rule I am trying
to maintain is that an honourable member
of this chamber cannot allude to the debates
in the other chamber.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Honourable senators,
I rise to a point of order. I think everybody
here should be treated alike. The honourable
gentleman from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) is
not the first one who has quoted from a
speech made in the other chamber.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I also rise on a point of order? It seems
to me that what the honourable gentleman
from Calgary wishes to discuss are broad
general statements that might have been
made anywhere. I suggest that if he would
discuss these statements without attributing
them to any member of the House of Commons, he would be perfectly in order.
The Hon. the Speaker: I thank the honourable member for his suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Ross: It has been stated by
someoneHon. Mr. Haig: That is better.
Hon. Mr. Ross: It has been stated by
someone:
It is our belief that the resolution should not be
passed until the Supreme Court of Canada has had
time and opportunity to establish itself in the confidence of the people of this country.

The Supreme Court of Canada was established seventy-four years ago. It has had
the time and the opportunity to establish
itself in the confidence of the people of this
country, and in the opinion of the great
majority of Canadians it has done so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Ross: As I have already pointed
out, the British North America Act is essentially an enumeration of general principles.
These principles must be applied and adapted
to new conditions as they present themselves.
In a national constitution there must be
capacity for expansion, in order that its
principles may fit and be applied to the
every-varying phases of business and social
life.
These expansions or "gaps" are quasi
judicial and quasi political. In so far as
they are judicial, either the Judicial Committee or the Supreme Court could be
depended upon to fill them in well. In so

far as they are political, I should much prefer
to see them filled in by the Supreme Court.
The judges of this court live in Canada.
They see the practical workings of our constitution for themselves. They are much
better able to fill in these gaps than are the
law lords who live three thousand miles
away, and few if any of whom have ever
even visited Canada and had an opportunity
to become familiar with the practical working
out of our constitution.
Many outstanding Canadians have more
faith in our Supreme Court than in the
Judicial Committee, particularly on constitutional matters. One eminent Canadian,
speaking at Fort William on the 23rd of
January, 1939, expressed the opinion that
the Judicial Committee, in interpreting our
constitution, did not carry out the intention
of the framers of confederation, but interpreted it too strongly in favour of the
provinces. He asserted:
As leader of the Conservative party, one of my
main ambitions is to lead this province back to the
plan of confederation. I advocate the strengthening
of national ties and divesting the province of every
conflicting authority not necessary for provincial
purposes.

The honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), in the very excellent
speech be delivered here a few days ago,
quoted the opinions of other distinguished
Canadians. I think they are right. And in
saying so, I do not consider that I am saying
anything derogatory to the law lords. For
the reasons already stated, I feel that the
judges of the Supreme Court, who are in
daily touch with the working out of our
constitution, should be much better able to
interpret it than are those whose knowledge
of this country is based only upon what
they read and what they hear from others.
Furthermore, at present the Supreme Court
is at a disadvantage for the following reason.
Appeals lie from the Supreme Court to the
Judicial Committee. When a case comes
before the court, the judges not only have to
make up their minds as to what they can
best do in the interest of justice, but they
must consider precedents laid down by the
Judicial Committee, and formulate decisions
consistent with those precedents.
Of course, when made the final court of
appeal, the Supreme Court will still be
guided in a measure by decisions of the Judicial Committee and by the court's own past
decisions. But it will not adhere to those
decisions so slavishly in the future as it has
done in the past. If the judges feel that the
Judicial Committee or their own Court erred
in the past, they will not continue the same
error for all time, but will no doubt feel free
to correct that error.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.

OCTOBER 27, 1949
Hon. Mr. Ross: For my part, I have great
faith in our Supreme Court, and I believe the
people of Canada have great faith in it.
An honourable member in another placeI wonder if I am permitted to refer to a
statement in that wayHon. Mr. Haig: No, that is not permissible.
Just say what statement has been made, but
do not say who made it or where it was made.
We shall know, or guess.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Thank you. A question has
been raised as to the good faith of the Prime
Minister. Notwithstanding the fact that the
Prime Minister, in opening the debate on the
motion and in interrupting a member, made
his position clearSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I am getting into trouble
again.
Since the Prime Minister became leader of
his party he has toured every province in
Canada; he has met and made friends with
tens of thousands of citizens; and the electors
by their votes expressed greater confidence in
him than an electorate ever before expressed
in any Canadian Prime Minister. Newspapers
and individuals have questioned his policies,
but I never heard of a paper or individual
questioning his frankness, sincerity or good
faith. It is unfortunate that anyone anywhere should deliver a nasty speech reflecting on the integrity of an honourable
member.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, it
had not been my purpose to speak on this
bill at all. At the moment I merely say in
passing that I am entirely in favour of the
purpose of the measure, and I hope that after
it is passed it will be utterly impossible for
Canadians to appeal to the Privy Council in
any kind of case whatsoever, whether it concerns provincial and federal jurisdictions, or
any other type of dispute. I hope it will not
be necessary to make two bites of the cherry,
and that once this bill is passed there will be
no further appeal by any Canadian to the
courts of another country-and Great Britain
is, after all, another country.
My real purpose in rising was to refer to
something that was brought to my mind by
the ruling of His Honour the Speaker. I do
not question that ruling at all. What I wish
to refer to is an antiquated rule under which
we in this house are supposed not to mention the House of Commons, except indirectly
as "another place". I wonder whether anybody has ever advanced an intelligible reason
why members of the Senate should not speak
of the House of Commons, by its name, or,
for that matter, why members of the House
of Commons should not make a direct reference to the Senate. What purpose is served

by prohibiting an honourable senator, as was
done a little while ago, from quoting from
a speech of a member of the House of Commons? By mentioning that other place I
know I am violating the rule. In the few
addresses I have made in this chamber I have
referred to the House of Commons by its
name, and I have not been called to order.
But I would like to know if there is any real
reason why the other place should not be
referred to by its name, and also if it is in
the public service to refrain from quoting
from the speech of a member in the House
of Commons. I know of no political reason
for such restriction, but if that is the rule,
then it is unreasonable, and should be
changed.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I intend to speak for only a few minutes on
this subject, but as an official of the courts in
the province of Manitoba, I feel that I should
say something on the measure before us. As
honourable senators know, all members of
the Bar are officials of the court, and it is
their duty to help the court to carry out the
laws of the land.
I wish to compliment the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) on the
very fine historical review he gave in his
speech. It was most enlightening and useful
to us. I wish also to congratulate the member
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) for
giving us the benefit of his extensive research.
In the province of Manitoba there is nc
real demand for abolishing appeals to the
Privy Council. There may be a small minority of the people in favour of it, but it is an
academic subject. As the honourable member from Vancouver South said, a large
number of appeals against the Dominion were
taken to the Privy Council by a former
premier of the province of Ontario. Until
my honourable friend made reference to the
pre-confederation discussions, which indicated
the attitude of Sir Oliver Mowat, I never
fully understood the real cause for such
appeals. It is a pity that Mowat was not on
the committee which drew up the resolution
to which I shall refer in a moment or two.
I say quite candidly that I agree with the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and I
hesitate to criticize the member for Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), because in his speeches
he makes a great contribution to the proceedings of this house. I do not always agree
with him-perhaps 99 times out of 100 I
would be against him on a vote-but I must
admit that he renders this house great service.
I do not think that before a body of lawyers
who understood the problems of this country
anyone could successfully attack the judgments

SENATE
of the Privy Council down through the years.
I recognize that under this proposed legislation we will have a much better Supreme
Court of Canada than we now have. We may
have the same judges, but they will make a
better court. I say that because I know that
men or women, once they are given authority
to render a final decision, avoid errors which
they would otherwise commit. For instance, I
recall appearing before a judge in my province who disagreed with my views, and who
said, "Go 'upstairs', Mr. Haig."
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is to the court of
appeal.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I went "upstairs", and there
proved that the judge in the lower court was
wrong. In Manitoba, the cases are largely
heard only before the lower court. Within
the past year and a half, two of our trial
judges have been elevated to the court of
appeal-there was no question of money
involved in their elevation-and I can
honestly say that they do not now seem like
the same two men. The reason for the change
is the added responsibility. For these reasons
I have no fear about making the Supreme
Court of Canada the final court.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) mentioned some men
in this country who, had the question of
income not been involved, would have made
good Supreme Court judges. The honourable
gentleman might have named several others,
including Isaac Pitblado, an eminent jurist,
who would have been an acquisition to any
court; and I am not resorting to flattery when
I say that my honourable friend would not
have made a bad judge. I know that at times
I would rather have appeared before him than
before some others I think of. There are
many eminent men who because of the
standard of living which they had to maintain, and the expenses they were under,
could not accept the salary offered.
I am not concerned about the proposal with
respect to the Supreme Court of Canada. I
am thinking, rather, of another resolution
which we will subsequently be asked to consider.
I may say, Mr. Speaker, that I am not trying to circumvent the rules, and speak about
that resolution now.
There has been a feeling in Canada that
confederation is a compact or an agreement.
It may sound contradictory, but I believe that
once that compact or agreement was made, it
was neither; it became an accomplished fact,
a thing which stood by itself. I do not believe
that the Maritime Provinces or the province
of Quebec would ever have come into confederation had it not been for certain undertakings which were put in that contract, but

my point is that technically and legally speaking we do not now have to go back to the
provinces and ask for their approval of constitutional amendments.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are dealing with this
country as a whole, but we must always
remember that there are ten subsidiary or
secondary governments which have ambitions. Because of the great size of this
country that will always be so. There is no
difficulty in establishing one court for the
province of Manitoba or the province of
British Columbia; but when it comes to dealing with the country as a whole, it is a different matter. Of course we must have our provincial governments to deal with certain
problems. Great Britain, about a third the
size of my province, has none of Canada's
difficulties in this respect.
My concern at the moment is this: that if
we pass legislation to amend the British North
America Act we will then go to the provinces
and ask for their consideration. I am not
changing my views on the legislation now
before us, but I do think that we should at
the same time discuss the resolution concerning the British North America Act. My
experience as a practising lawyer has taught
me that I can do more for my client's cause
by going to the office of the opposing lawyer
and talking to him there, than I can by
writing letters to him. No one can get anywhere by passing legislation and then saying
"Take it or leave it". I do not admit that
there was a compact. I am persuaded that
originally the intention of the Prime Minister
was to have a conference. Why he changed
his mind I do not know. Probably he had
good reasons: at any rate I am not imputing
to him any improper motives, for I do not
believe he is that kind of a man. But, whether
you agree with the Premier of Nova Scotia,
the Premier of Quebec, the Premier of
Alberta, or the head of any other province,
it seems to me that a thorough discussion of
the matters at issue would "smoke out" the
man or men, if any there be, who are guilty
of unreasonably opposing this advance-for
it is an advance to put these proposals into
law and to adopt an Address to amend the
British North America Act.
Now the men in whom the final interpretation of our law is to be vested are the members of the Supreme Court of Canada. They,
like the rest of us, are only human. It is
important to remember that. My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) remarked that the United States
Supreme Court is noted for the judgments it
has given affecting the constitution of the
United States. Its power was so great that

OCTOBER 27, 1949
so eminent a statesmen as the late President
Roosevelt attempted by legislation to change
the personnel of the court. Because he was
re-elected and time ran in his favour,
President Roosevelt was able to appoint to
that bench men who held views similar to
his own. But I do not believe that any
Dominion Government, whatever its political
complexion, would deliberately select a man
for the Supreme Court because he favoured
the policies of that government. To my mind
that is not conceivable. But if you appoint
men to the bench who have been brought up
in a certain atmosphere, they will carry that
atmosphere to the bench.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I remember that some years
ago the chairman of our Divorce Committee
was a very distinguished member of this
house, now deceased, whose wife was a
divorcee. When she got her divorce she married my friend. After some experience with
him on the committee, I once said to him,
"You are pretty strong for granting divorces".
He said "Yes, Haig, I am. Why should I not
be? I have got the finest woman in the world
as a wife." I said "I agree with you." There
you see how human nature works. Every man
in this chamber is prejudiced by the environment in which he was reared, by the schools
and the university he attended, by the city
and the country in which he lived; and if he
is a lawyer he will carry that environment to
the bench. He cannot help it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But would that affect
his judgments?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it would. I think it
would affect anybody's judgment. Certainly
President Roosevelt thought so: he wanted on
the Supreme Court men who had been nurtured in the philosophy of the New Deal.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But Roosevelt was disappointed with the men he appointed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be. Perhaps the
Conservative party are disappointed at the
consequences of putting me in this chamber,
but they cannot help themselves. Now I am
here, and they cannot put me out.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You have become a
Liberal since you came to this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps they don't like me
for that. Maybe they want me to go back to
the old party.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Maybe that is why they
want to amend the constitution!
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe. I have not con.sulted them on that.
I can understand the attitude towards this
question of my honourable friend from

Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) as evidenced
in his speech the other day. There is, I
believe, a certain amount of feeling in some
parts of Canada, mainly perhaps in the province of Quebec, that we are ridding ourselves
of an impediment which retards our progress
to nationhood; that at present we are not
quite free. I do not agree with that view.
Technically it may be correct, but it is not
really so. We have had the freedom of our
own free impulses. As long ago as 1875, as
the honourable member from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) pointed out, the Canadian parliament thought they were doing what we are
doing today. The issue is not a new one.
I would not accuse the government of acting
hastily in this matter. All I am concerned to
point out is that Canada is a difficult country
to govern. We have a number of provinces;
our distances are great; the people of one
province speak a language which the majority
do not understand, and vice versa. There is
the great problem of unity. We should not do
anything in haste. If a conference were successfully held, all the better. If it were
unsuccessful, at least we would know where
to lay the blame. I think that would be a
great advantage.
In this regard our house has more responsibility than the House of Commons. Its members are the representatives of certain areas;
we are here as senators, and while I have the
honour to be a senator from Manitoba, and
others are here from New Brunswick or Nova
Scotia or some other province, all of us are
here really as Canadians, to determine what
is best for the unity of all Canada. We have
no need to fight among ourselves on local
issues. If another honourable senator from
Manitoba does not agree with something
I advocate, he is not exposed to derision in
his own province because of that disagreement, for he has given allegiance to the higher
unity.
For all these reasons I believe the provinces
should be called into conference with the
federal authority. As I have said, it was my
impression that such was originally the intention of the Prime Minister, though I do not
accuse him of changing attitudes. I am not
sure that such a conference would succeed.
Politics might seep in to such an extent that it
would fail, but at least we should have tried.
If Macdonald and Cartier and Brown had not
agreed to get together and talk, this country
would never have had confederation; there
would have been, instead, four or five or
maybe six separate and independent entities.
The greatness of Canada is the result of
unity, and there is not a man or woman in
Canada in the last fifty years who has not
praised the Fathers of Confederation for
what they did. We who are in politics know

SENATE
what sacrifices those men must have made to
achieve that union, and if their effort was
worth while, it is worth while making an
effort to perpetuate feelings of unity and good
will.
I am going to vote for the bill. I have no
fear of the Supreme Court of Canada not
being able to fulfil the functions of a Supreme
Court. As regards salaries, I admit that they
may have to be even greater than the amounts
now proposed, because I want to see on the
Supreme Court bench men of the calibre indicated by the honourable member from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). It is true
that some men will accept appointments to
the bench even at a sacrifice of income,
because they like that kind of work, and some
I know have not made as lawyers as much
as they now receive as judges; but a good
many lawyers can earn very much more than
judges, and at the same time enjoy greater
personal independence.
I hope that when we come to consider the
resolution to amend the British North America
Act, some effective solution will be found.
In the United States, as the honourable member from Vancouver South has pointed out,
the constitution can be amended only through
a vote of two-thirds of the House of Representatives, two-thirds of the Senate and twothirds of the States. I would not favour that
procedure for this country. It might be
practicable to apply the two-thirds provision
to the House of Commons, but I do not think
it would work as far as the Senate is concerned, and difficulties would arise with the
provinces in view of the fact that more than

half the population is contained in only two
of them.
I would say, in conclusion, that the subject
should be explored more thoroughly with a
view of getting, if not a united nation, a
much greater degree of unity on the question.
As I said, I propose to vote for the bill.
I trust that the wisdom of the Canadian
people will be such as to make the new
Supreme Court a success.

SENATE

one cannot say what historians will note in
years to come, but it does appear to me that
those who will look back upon this matter,
in connection with other progress which we
have made, will mention it with pride.
This bill, in my judgment, represents progress in our land. It seems to me that no
nation worthy of the name would permit any
other nation to constitute its courts and to
control its judicial system, as we have been
doing in the past, but, I am very glad to say,
will not do in the future. As a Canadian, as
a lawyer of some years' standing at the
Ontario Bar, as a member of Parliament, I
must at least express my satisfaction with
the step which we are now taking.
When I have said that I have really said
nearly all that is required. A long address on
this subject, particularly on this night, would
be inappropriate, and for three good reasons.
The first is that advocacy is at this stage
quite unnecessary, because there is so little
opposition to the bill that it is passing into
law with almost universal consent and
approval. The bill that is before us bas
already passed the House of Commons, and I
think I am right in saying that we in the
Senate are ready to pass it on to the Governor
General.
A second good reason is that while the bill
represents an exceedingly important constitutional and legal development, it will not
be followed by any very far-reaching or
drastic changes in our substantive law. At
least, that is my opinion. If the constitutional
amendments now in contemplation are carried
into effect, the consequential changes will be
very deliberate, will take place over some
years, and in every instance will be only such
as may be reviewed and approved by our
parliament and, if necessary, corrected. So
I see no danger at all to the substantive law
of Canada by reason of the amendments
proposed in this bill.
The third reason which makes it unnecessary for me to discuss the matter much longer
is the masterly and complete address, entirely
in accordance with my views, which was
delivered in this bouse on the 18th of the
month by one of our members. With the
views of the honourable senator frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) I very heartily
agree, and I congratulate him on the skill
and ability with which he presented his
thoughts to this house.
With that observation I might well conclude my remarks, but there are one or two
points which I should like to add.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
told us, in effect, that the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council exercises legislative as
well as judicial functions. Of course, every
court does that, to at least some extent. In

countries such as Canada, where judges are
expected to follow, the decisions of other
judges of co-ordinate or superior jurisdiction,
precedents are set and new laws are made.
This is a legislative function. The distinction
between the judges of the Canadian courts
and the members of the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council is that our judges carefully refrain frorn altering an Act of parliament, and so overriding parliament itself; on
the other hand, the members of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council apparently
have .considered thernselves beyond any such
limitations. Our judges regard themselves as
the servants of parliament, bound as a matter
of honour and duty to carry out the Acts of
the parliament which they serve. The members of the Privy Council do not so regard
themselves.
The senator frorn Inkerman told us that the
members of the Privy Council, in their interpreting of the British North America Act and
in the filling in of the gaps which were necessarily left by the Fathers of Confederation in
the legislation of 1867, have actually altered
the fundamental enactment of the Imperial
House which forms the constitution of
Canada. This they have done in keeping
with their own ideas of a policy suitable to the
circumstances which they imagined existed
from time to time in Canada. I believe the
member from Inkerman proved his point.
I have in my hand a notable booklet
entitled A Study in Canadian Citizenship, by
Ira A. MacKay, M.A., LL.B., Ph.D., of McGill
University, written in 1924 and widely publicized by the Kiwanis Clubs of Montreal. It
is an authoritative document on the entire
governmental system in Canada. In my opinion this booklet, which came to my hands
through the kindness and courtesy of the
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) shows so
wide and accurate a grasip of our governmental institutions that I wish, with leave,
to burden the house with a quotation from it.
The author says:
The Privy Council, in a word, is a select loosely
constituted body of the King's constitutional advisers and personal companions and attendants. It
is at once a legislative, judicial, executive and
purely private body privy to the King in person and
assisting him in every human way in the government of a great people. Historically it is the lineal
descendant, the apostolic successor to the old Witenagemot of Anglo-Saxon days and the Curia Regis
of later Norman days which has never really ceased
to exist from then until now.
He continues:
What then is the Judicial Committee? The answer
is that the Judicial Committee is a committee of
jurists carved out of the Privy Council to act as a
final court of appeal in law for the overseas
dominions, just as the Imperial Cabinet is a committee carved out of the Privy Council to act as
the King's executive
council for the United
Kingdom.

OCTOBER 31, 1949
Once again:
Since the committee sits as a King's Council, it Is
always something more than a strict court of law
and, therefore, is not bound as rigidly as other
courts are bound by existing rules of law. It is not
bound by the decisions of any other court of law.
It is not bound even by its own previous decisions.

Hon. Mr. Farris: Does he give any authority
for these statements?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, but I have checked
them and found them to be true.
As a King's Council it has admittedly in addition
to its judicial power some slight background or
reserve of legislative power. It may, if it think just
and proper, arrive at its decisions on principles of
policy rather than by strictly defined rules of law.
It is not wholly confined to the interpretation and
administration of existing law; it may upon occasion
make new laws or at least adapt old rules and principles of law to new conditions overseas. In this
way it is not unlike the old Court of Chancery or
Equity in England which was originally designed to
adid some element of flexibility or humanness to the
rigid, technical rules of common law in cases of
marked hardship or injustice. Perhaps it is this
background of legislative or political power, this
element of flexibility, and the consequent element
of uncertainty in the decisions of the Committee
which has brought upon its head so much sharp
criticism by professional lawyers in Canada and in
some of the other overseas dominions.

Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask if the person
who wrote this is an associate of Dr. Marsh?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I could not answer that
question. At all events, what I have quoted
coincides very closely with the information
given us by the senator for Inkerman, and
I might add that it checks with my own
knowledge of actual conditions before the
Privy Council.
I am not here to presume to criticize the
members of the Privy Council for basing
decisions with respect to the Canadian constitution upon questions of policy rather than
upon rules of law. But I will say this, that
if changes in our Canadian constitution are
to be made on such grounds, those changes
should be made here in Canada, not in the
United Kingdom. When in future we wish
to make any important amendment of the
constitution of Canada, let us make it ourselves in accordance with our own ideas of
a policy suitable to Canadian conditions. That
principle is, I think, elementary for any truly
national Canadian. It is the purpose for
which parliament is maintained.
I know there are those who would retain
the court across the sea because of a bellef
in the supposed superiority of the members
of the bench and bar who are invited by the
Chancellor of Great Britain to be so-called
advisers of the King in this connection. Far
kine usually have long horns. An expert
has been defined as "a very ordinary fellow
away from home." Apparently our judges
suffer somewhat fron their proximity to
45785-141

ourselves. Perhaps it is familiarity that, on
the part of some people, breeds contempta sentiment which I do not share. I recall the
old saying from the highest source that "a
prophet is not without honour save in his own
country and in his own house."
As a matter of fact, honourable senators,
having practised in both courts, and having
met, both officially and socially, the judges
both of the Privy Council and of the Supreme
Court of Canada, it is my considered judgment that there is no need to disparage either
court for the benefit of the other. All these
are able men; all are public-spirited men and
men of conscience. Finally, they are men of
the same race as ourselves. That is true even
of the French-Canadian members of our
court: they, too, come from Normandy, the
place of origin of a large section of our
English-speaking people. The same type and
the same class of men occupy seats on both
these courts. Frankly, I hold them all in the
greatest respect. Nor in the matter of education is there any general superiority of one
set of men over the other. Who is there to
say that our common school system, our
secondary schools, our schools of law are in
any way inferior to those elsewhere, or that
ours are better than theirs? Nor, so far as
I have been able to observe, is there anything
in the intellectual atmosphere or environment
on one side which makes for greater distinction than on the other. There is nothing on
either side which would warrant the inquiry
which Shakespeare makes in these words:
Upon what meat does this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great?

The result of any comparison of the individuals who constitute these courts is necessarily a matter of opinion. Such a comparison,
therefore, is futile; I will go further, and say
that it is objectionable; it is this type of
comparison which is referred to in the old
saying that comparisons are odious. There
are much more cogent reasons for the change
that we now propose than any supposed
superiority of one set of judges over another.
May I ask honourable senators what would
be said were the Supreme Court of Canada
to suddenly announce that its future hearings
of Canadian cases would be held in London,
England. Were such a preposterous proposal
made, it would certainly meet with an overwhelming objection and the weaving of a
crown of glory around the heads of the members of the bench would be no answer to the
inconvenience and undue cost of arguing
cases thousands of miles away from our own
shores. Were our courts to suggest anything
so utterly preposterous, our judges themselves
would be laughed out of court. I know that
at least some members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are conscious of

SENATE
the inordinate and unjust expense levied
upon Canadian suitors, who are compelled to
travel across the ocean to obtain decisions in
their cases. One of the English judges told
me about ten years ago that consideration was
being given at that time to a proposal to
have the Judicial Committee sit abroad: it
would visit Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa and other places, as occasion
might require. It seems to me that, had that
proposal been carried into effect, we might
not now be considering the entire abolition
of appeals to the Privy Council. It would be
intolerable to self-respecting people such as
Canadians to continue taking cases across the
ocean, at an expense sometimes of many
thousands of dollars, in order to have them
tried in a strange environment.
There are some timid souls who feel, of
course, that were we to abolish these appeals
we would lose the guiding hand of these
supermen across the sea, and so they have
suggested that we change the rules of stare
decisis to make the rule a matter of law; that
is to say, that the usual rule followed by all
courts should become statutory law. The rule
that one judge follows the decision already
made by another judge of a court of
co-ordinate or superior jurisdiction, is a good
rule so long as it remains a rule. A rule is
subject to exceptions-as the old saying goes:
"Exceptions prove the rule"-but to a law
there are no exceptions. The value of a rule is
that it may be followed when it should be
followed, and it need not be followed when
it should not be followed.
Should some provision of the British North
America Act conflict in the future with a
decision of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, I would expect our local
judges to follow the Act and not the decision.
And I think that is what they will do. One
wonders how progress could be made if the
present-day judges always followed the decisions of their predecessors. How could you
have progress in judicial matters under such
circumstances? And surely there is progress
in law just as there is progress in all other
things. There is progress in the breadth of
conception of judges as the years go by, and
as knowledge widens and sympathies increase.
It would have been a sorry day indeed for the
judicial progress of Great Britain had we at
any time in centuries past tied our judges
to the barbarisms of previous days. Honourable senators, I am thoroughly opposed-and
I think most informed lawyers will agree with
me-to changing a rule, which is now only a
rule, into a statutory provision. I think that
such a change would be a disaster of great
magnitude.
So for these and for many other reasons,
which I might enumerate, I congratulate the

Prime Minister of Canada upon his courage
in initiating this legislation. I congratulate
him for attempting to bring to a close, I think
for all time, the senseless and expensive procedure of carrying Canadian cases across the
sea to be decided in an atmosphere which is
not our own.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, may
I first of all bring attention to the fact that,
except for the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) who passed on a
special message of her own to which I shall
later refer, so far only members of the legal
profession have contributed to this debate.
It appears to me that the proposed amendment to the Supreme Court Act is not entirely
a legal matter. It involves the high government policy of this country, and it seems to
me that any member of this house who has
had any parliamentary experience can talk
intelligently about the subject, and perhaps
contribute something that the legal members
have failed to contribute.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, this
is an Act to amend the Supreme Court Act,
and the effect of it is to abolish appeals to the
Privy Council. I have listened most attentively to the speeches that have been made
by the eminent legal members of this chamber, and I must say that they were most
interesting. They brought to mind many of
the things I have learned about the British
North America Act, and especially the fact
that we are so dependent upon outside assistance to carry on the internal functions of
our country.
During this debate I listened to the specialists: I heard a splendid speech by the senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and a
vigorous speech by the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris); and this
evening we had a good speech by the member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who
seemed to be in harmony with the member
from Inkerman. Well, specialists sometimes
disagree, but a peculiar feature of this discussion is that while these specialists had
different and opposing views, each arrived
at the same conclusion-that he was going
to vote for the bill.
One of the things that has made an impression upon my mind during this debate is the
fact that Sir. John A. Macdonald and his
associates, who framed the resolutions on
which the British North America Act was
based, had it in mind that the Canadian
parliament would establish a General Court
of Appeal for Canada, which would be the
final court of appeal in this country. To me,
as a layman, that seems clear from section

OCTOBER 31, 1949
101 of the British North America Act. However, Sir John Macdonald was a great admirer
of the laws of England, and a little persuasion
convinced him that he had better leave well
enough alone.
My experience during the years in municipal councils, in provincial legislatures, and
in parliament has convinced me that many
of our people have been against abolition of
appeals to the Privy Council for reasons of
sentiment or because they were fearful of
the change. You would expect most Canadians to be sentimental in a matter of this
kind, and perhaps it is only natural that
some people should be fearful; but it seemed
to me strange indeed that the members of
the Canadian Bar Association should be
among them. They wanted the bill delayed.
This suggests that our lawyers lack confidence
in themselves, for some of them will become
judges, and most of them plead before the
courts.
I think that those who argue in favour of
continuing appeals to the Privy Council are
trying to perpetuate a system that is outmoded even in Britain. It certainly is outmoded in Australia, South Africa and India,
and in my opinion Canada is rather late in
asserting her right and desire to govern fully
within her own borders. After al that has
been said by the legal gentlemen in this house
and after all the information we have
received, I think we can express the present
situation in a few words, namely, that the
people of this country have decided that the
time has come to abolish appeals to the Privy
Council.
Many people say that the Privy Council,
during all the years our final court of appeal,
was a splendid judicial body, and I have no
doubt that it was. For a long time I have
been deeply interested in its decisions. As
I talked to law students, professors and practising lawyers, I formed the same opinion as
did the senator from Inkerman that the Privy
Council was generally favourable to the
provinces; and that the reason why it was
favourable to the provinces was, to put it
bluntly and honestly, that it did not want
too much authority to repose in the central
government of Canada. That may have been
a matter of policy of the British authorities,
duly carried out by the Privy Council, and if
we think this is true, it is honest to say so.
They are human, after all, and humans are
not infallible.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
referred to the late Honourable C. H. Cahan,
K.C., and the late W. F. O'Connor, K.C., both
eminent lawyers and natives of the province
of Nova Scotia. I knew Mr. Cahan for many
years. I sat with him in the House of Commons and heard him make his speech advocating the abolition of appeals to the Privy

Council. I must say that as I listened to him
I was amazed-not by the speech, but by the
fact that it came from a Conservative member of the House of Commons at a time when
most of us had not yet made up our minds
as to whether or not we should like the
Supreme Court to be our final court of appeal.
But after I heard the reply made by the late
Mr. Lapointe, then Minister of Justice, I said
to myself "This is the beginning of the end."
Whatever anyone may say now of Mr.
Cahan's speech, history has justified it, for
the plea which he made is about to be granted.
I thought the senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) was a little ungenerous to
the memory of Mr. Cahan, who was not only
an eminent Nova Scotian but also a great
Canadian and an able lawyer. My honourable
friend from Vancouver South said he concluded that Mr. Cahan had been embittered
because of reverses suffered at the hands of
the Privy Council, or words to that effect.
I should put Mr. Cahan's position on a higher
ground. I should say that, by reason of his
experience before the Privy Council and in
the practice of law, he had become a qualified
critic and was therefore eminently fitted to
express his views to his fellow members of
parliament.
As for Mr. O'Connor, I knew him when he
was a member of the Board of Control in the
city of Halifax. I was then mayor of Lunenburg, and the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia
was the mayor of Halifax. Mr. O'Connor
already enjoyed a local reputation as a coming
lawyer of ability. I knew him well, and
when he was Parliamentary Counsel for the
Senate I used to come over from the other
chamber to see him. I regarded him as a
personal friend and I could always benefit by
my discussion with him. My honourable
friend from Vancouver South was not very
generous to Mr. O'Connor. He said that Mr.
O'Connor had pet theories.
Well, most
specialists have.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Was that ungenerous?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Most specialists stand
out in front, ahead of the general trend of
affairs. Mr. O'Connor, in my opinion, was,
not an extremist, but an extremely well
informed man.
Nobody in this house can make more out
of the facts in a case than the honourable
senator from Vancouver South. He said he
came to the conclusion that he should vote
for the bill, not because of its virtue but
because of public opinion. I should say that
he came to a good conclusion, but as a practical man I was surprised that he came to it in
such a peculiar way. Everybody in Canada,
I am sure, senses the great change that has
taken place in public opinion in this country,
especially over the last few years. Public

SENATE
opinion of a decade ago was quite different.
I was then in the House of Commons, and I
well remember the amazement caused by Mr.
Cahan's speech. I have already said that I
myself was amazed, and I am sure that the
speech must have been a great surprise as
well to many of his political friends, and
brought discomfort to them. But time is a
great healer and, as I also have previously
said, it has justified Mr. Cahan.
I recall the intense and heated debates
concerning Dominion Day. Many people
argued that "dominion" did not mean domination. I think that publie opinion on that
question has now been clarified. On the
question of a national flag, I think that public
opinion has also undergone a change. There
is a feeling today that our country has outgrown its dependence upon institutions
beyond our shores, and that perhaps because
of certain sentimentalities and high ideals,
we have already waited too long in making
our position clear.
I heard a good deal from the two honourable senators opposite who spoke on this
measure, about what is known as stare
decisis. Their arguments were interesting,
especially to a layman. To me it seems most
peculiar that a new court in Canada should
be bound by the precedents and decisions of
the Privy Council. I agree that such precedents should be a guide to the court.
In that way the jurists who compose the
new court could make such use of the judgments of the Privy Council as they thought
proper.
It has been said that Canadian judges
might be favourable to central control. Well,
our judges, before their appointment to the
bench have usually been members of a
political party, but I have never heard it said
that a judge carried his politics onto the
bench or had any biased political views. It
has always seemed to me that the men we
have appointed were big enough and clean
enough to forget their politics and consider
only the cause of justice.
Every judge is a Canadian and a provincial.
I know that the judges who come from Nova
Scotia bring with them a love for that province, and a feeling that no matter how long
they ýmay stay in Ottawa, the place where
they were born is the best part of Canada.
I believe that the judges of the Supreme
Court will have a love for their home provinces and an understanding of local conditions
that should allay all our fears. I believe also
that, the new court will be held in high
esteem in accord with what has always been
the ideal and the tradition of the Canadian
people. We all know that England has a great
judiciary, as has also the United States, but

I think that the present Canadian judiciary
is above reproach and that the new Supreme
Court will maintain that standard.
My honourable friend the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) asked the
question: Who in Canada has ever been hurt
by the Privy Council? I do not know what
my Conservative friends may say about
this, but I think that the late Lord Bennett,
when he was leader of the Conservative
party, was hurt by it when it quashed his
new deal and declared that it was ultra vires.
As honourable members will recall, the party
to which I belong went to England later and
had an Act passed which brought the subjects
in question under the provisions of the British
North American Act. All that was wrong
with the proposal of the late Lord Bennett
was that it was ahead of its time, and he
evidently went at it in the wrong way. Such
procedure shows how futile are the judgments
of the Privy Council. Even today when it
hands down a judgment which we do not
like, we promptly amend the British North
America Act.
The changing of this Act
in Great Britain has become a matter of
form, for the Privy Council would not dare
refuse any request to change the constitution
which came from the Canadian parliament.
The Lemieux Act, which I think was also
disallowed by the Privy Council, was a piece
of advanced labour legislation which was in
the interest of both employers and labour.
It was only when we secured certain changes
to the British North America Act that the
influences of the Lemieux Act were again
felt in Canada.
Something was said about one of our lady
senators.
This honourable lady spoke in
favour of the Privy Council, because it
opened the door for ber to come into this
chamber. She frankly said that the Privy
Council had contributed something to the
emancipation of women. I do not know
what my lawyer friends thought about that
case, or what the Privy Council meant by
its judgment. I choose to adopt the "living
tree" doctrine put forward by the honourable
senator from Inkerman, for I believe that as
the living tree grows it has to be pruned.
Regardless of what the framers of the British
North American Act had in mind earlier,
it seems to me that after Canada gave women
the right to vote, it was perfectly natural to
appoint women to the Senate. I do not think
we need to worry about that subject.
Some people today talk against progress
and choose to worship the past. Accordingly,
they stress history. The late Henry Ford is
reported to have said that history was the
bunk. That was a strange statement, and
one to which I cannot subscribe. But Henry
Ford was a practical man of great achievements, and I have no doubt that he was

OCTOBER 31, 1949
hobbled and restricted in his plans by men
who looked back to the past and had little
vision of the future. It may be that in his
frustration he made that rather remarkable
statement.
We hear a good deal too about the lessons
to be taken from history. After all, history
is a record of wars and disasters, of the
efforts of people to get back to something
like normal in the intervening periods of
peace. History also tells us of forceful men
who led others and who controlled the destinies of nations. Cromwell, though he did
some good, did not care much about precedents, and Napoleon certainly did not
regard precedents seriously; yet he gave to
the world the Napoleonic Code, which today
is considered one of the finest codes of law
in the world. The conditions of their time
gave these men their opportunities.
I think that Canadians are well qualified
to look after their own judicial affairs. I do
not think that anybody will deny that the
Privy Council has done a great work; its
term of service is a period in our history.
But England bas changed, and today free
enterprise in that country is being restricted.
There are both quick and wonderful changes
taking place in the world, and for Canada
the time has come to make changes-need
we say more-and the vote will tell the tale.
In looking forward may I leave with you
the words of the apostle Paul, when he said:
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those
things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
those things which are before, I press toward the
mark for the prize....

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I had expected that this debate
would be concluded this evening; but I happen to know that the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), who bas given
a good deal of time and consideration to this
question, intended to speak last week but was
prevented from doing so by circumstances
beyond his control. I have not heard whether
his intention has since changed, but as he has
devoted so much thought to the subject I
should be sorry to have the debate closed this
evening in his absence. I shall therefore ask
honourable senators, after I have said a few
words on the matter, to agree that the debate
be adjourned to afford the honourable senator
from Toronto an opportunity to speak, if he
wishes to do so.
I do not need to say that I am in favour of
this bill and hope that it will pass this house.
I have listened to the arguments for further
delay, but it seerns to me that delay would
serve no useful purpose. The bill comes to
us as the expressed will of the other branch
of parliament. It can hardly be said that it
falls within the category of "hasty legisla-

tion", since, as the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has pointed
out, similar action, or what at the time was
thought to be similar action, was taken by
this bouse seventy-four years ago.
In case it should be argued that public
opinion had changed in the meantime, and
that parliament has no mandate for the bill,
I need only refer to the cogent arguments of
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris). It seems to me that our duty is
clear, and I hope and believe that this house
will act accordingly.
I confess to feelings of great pride in the
fact that I am for the moment government
leader of a house whose members, in advancing their opinions both for and against this
legislation, have set so high a standard of
parliamentary debate. I have heard many
complimentary remarks about it from competent observers both within and outside this
chamber.
Although there have been differences of
opinion as to the decisions made by the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with
respect to Canada, there has been general
agreement, I believe, that the services rendered by that court to Canada have been
very great. To this viewpoint I heartily subscribe; and my appreciation is in nowise
lessened by the knowledge that over the
whole period of time in which the Judicial
Committee has served this country no charges
for this service has fallen upon the Government of Canada.
It is with the greatest pleasure, therefore,
that I inform honourable senators that I have
gladly referred to the government for consideration the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Inkerman, that at this time,
when in all likelihood that long connection
of the Privy Council with Canada will be
severed, some appropriate recognition of their
great services should be made by the proper
authority.
I should not like to allow this occasion to
pass without saying a word of appreciation of
the work of the courts of justice in our own
country, presided over by judges who for so
many years have performed with impartiality
and dignity the high duties entrusted to them.
The character and intellectual capacity of
the bench are of the highest public importance. Canada has produced some great
judges; and competent people, Canadians and
others, have often praised the high standards
of our courts in the administration of justice.
I am heartily in agreement with the conclusions drawn by the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Justice, that our Supreme
Court, receiving its inspiration from the Privy
Council, will be, in the words of the honourable senator from Vancouver, "just as great,

SENATE
distinguished and able a court of last resort
as the Privy Council bas been". The honourable senator did well to remind us, however,
that there are certain practical difficulties in
the way of accomplishing this fine ideal. As
he has said, we should not be too complacent;
we must resolve to do everything in our
power to achieve that end. With the passing
of this legislation, new and added responsibilities will fall on all those charged with
the administration of justice in Canada, and
I am confident that those concerned will
respond accordingly.
It is of course possible, as a result of some
of the reasons which the honourable senator
from Vancouuver South has enumerated, and

which rightly or wrongly have been part of
our traditional procedure-I might instance
geographical considerations-that a relatively
small number of appointees to the court may
not be men of the highest qualifications. But
it should be remembered that the services of
those who are not appointed to the Bench are
still available as advocates. So we can rest
happily in the belief that in that capacity
their great abilities will not be lost to the
country of which they and we are so proud.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

Hon. Mr. Farris: Then I beg to move the
AMENDMENT
resolution.
Honourable senators, this resolution asks
ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY-MOTION
the Imperial Parliament to amend section 91
On the Notice of Motion:
of the Canadian constitution, known as the
That an humble Address be presented to His
British North America Act. That section proMajesty the King in the following words:
vides as follows:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:

THE SENATE

Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada in parliament assembled,
humbly approach Your Majesty, praying that you
may graciously be pleased to cause a measure to be
laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom
to be expressed as follows:
An Act to amend the British North America Act,
1867, relating to the amendment of the Constitution
of Canada.
Whereas the Senate and Commons of Canada in
parliament assembled have submitted an Address to
His Majesty praying that His Majesty may graciously be pleased to cause a measure to be laid
before the Parliament of the United Kingdom for
the enactment of the provisions hereinafter set
forth:
Be it therefore enacted by the Klng's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent
of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,
in this present parliament assembled, and by the
authority of the same, as follows:
1. Section ninety-one of the British North Anerica
Act, 1867, is amended by renumbering Class I thereof
as Class IA and by inserting therein immediately
before that Class the following as Class I:
"1. The amendment from time to time of the Constitution of Canada, except as regards matters coming within the classes of subjects by this Act
assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, or as regards rights or privileges by this or
any other constitutional act granted or secured to
the legislature or the government of a province, or
to any class of persons with respect to schools or
as regards the use of the English or the French
language, or as regards the requirements that there
shall be a session of the Parliament of Canada at
least once each year, and that no House of Commons shall continue for more than five years from
the day of the return of the writs for choosing the
House; provided however, that a House of Commons
may in time of real or apprehended war, invasion
or insurrection be continued by the Parliament of
Canada, if such continuation is not opposed by the
votes of more than one-third of the members of
such house."
2. This Act may be cited as the British North
America Act, 1949 (No. 2), and the British North
America Acts, 1867-1949, and this Act may be cited
together as the British North America Acts, 1867-

1949 (No. 2).
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to present
the first motion on the Order Paper, which
stands in my name.

It shall be lawful for the King, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate and House of
Commons to make laws for the peace, order, and
good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by
this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of
the provinces, and for greater certainty, but not
so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms
of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends
to all matters coming within the classes of subjects
next hereinafter enumerated.

The aniendment will provide that the first
of the enumerated headings in section 91, as
amended, will be "Power to make laws" for:
1. The amendment from time to time of the Constitution of Canada, except as regards matters coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned
exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, or-

This is a further exception.
-as regards rights or privileges by this or any
other constitutional Act granted or secured to the
legislature or the government of a province, or-

This is the next exception.
-to any class of persons with respect to schools or
as regards the use of the English or the French
language, or as regards the requirements that there
shall be a session of the Parliament of Canada at
least once each year, and that no House of Commons
shall continue for more than five years from the day
of the return of the writs for choosing the house;
provided however, that a House of Commons may in
time of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection be continued by the Parliament of Canada,
if such continuation Is not opposed by the votes of
more than one-third of the members of such house.

Honourable senators will see that this
amendment proposes to give to the Parliament of Canada-the Senate and the House
of Commons, with the assent of the Governor
General-power to amend, in certain limited
fields, the Imperial Act known as the British
North America Act, passed -in 1867. I
emphasize the words "limited fields", because
the exceptions that I have read indicate that
the fields of amendment proposed to be
extended to the Parliament of Canada are
restricted to matters essentially pertaining to
Canada as a whole, as distinguished from
matters coming within the rights of the provinces or of any classes in the community.

SENATE

The resolution asking for this amendment
marks an important constitutional development in the national growth of Canada. It is
the first step in what will eventually be the
vesting of Canada with complete power to
amend her own constitution. We do not know
what form the amendment will take, but in
Canada will rest the complete and exclusive
power to amend her constitution. That,
honourable senators, is a matter of great constitutional import to this nation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
riend a question?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does that power apply to
language and education, or must those matters be considered by the Imiperial Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Farris: They will come within our
right to amend when the final steps have been
completed. I am pleased that my honourable
friend has asked that question, because
apparently I did not make my point quite
clear. This is what is now proposed: We say
the Canadian parliament shall have power
to amend its constitution, with certain specified exceptions. The first exception is such
matters as my honourable friend refers to.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understood that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then I am wondering
what my honourable friend did not understand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Am I to understand that,
after this resolution has been approved, the
right to amend the constitution with respect
to education and language will still rest with
the Imperial Parliament? Am I right or wrong
in that assumption?
Hon. Mr. Farris: It depends on what my
friend means by his question. If he means
after this resolution has become effective, he
is right: ail these matters will still remain
within the power of the Imperial Parliament
until such time as conferences have taken
place between the provinces and the dominion,
and agreement has been reached. It is hoped
that such agreement will result in another
request to the Imperial Parliament to further
amend the British North America Act by
extending to Canada the power to make
amendments as to all matters, including education, language and so forth. If agreement
is reached, it will mean that there will be
very well defined limitations as to the basis
on which such a power may be exercised.
I do not know, but it may be that amendments of that nature can be made only with
the unanimous consent of the provinces. But
honourable senators can speculate as to what
will be done, as well as I can. In some

matters the procedure will be comparatively
simple, but as to amendments of fundamental
principles, there will have to be unanimous
agreement by the provinces.
The question raised by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is not before
the house at the present time, except to the
extent that, after the first step is taken in
regard to matters considered to be entirely
federal, a conference will be held with the
provinces to see if some understanding can
be arrived at as to the basis for a further
application to the Imperial Parliament for
amendments along the lines he mentions.
That question is entirely in the future.
The consensus of opinion in this country
is that the time has come when Canada
should be responsible for her own constitution, its development and amendment; and
the first step towards that end is now being
taken by asking the Senate and the House of
Commons to pass a resolution requesting that
the dominion as a whole be given power to
enact constitutional amendments concerning
matters which are exclusively the concern
of the dominion. When that has been accomplished, the next step will be a conference
between the dominion and the provinces
which, I notice by the press, will be held on
January 10 next.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Have the other dominions
a right to amend their constitutions?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Davies: They have gone that far?
Hon. Mr. Farris: All of them. The only
reason that we have not that power is that
in 1931, when the Statute of Westminster was
passed, this dominion was not prepared to
agree on any method of amending its own
constitution, and at the request of this country the power was left where it has always
been.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
gentleman tell us what are these matters
which the Dominion Parliament in the future
may amend?
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend
does not want me to make my speech before
I begin it? A good part of my speech will
be in explanation of that very thing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Farris: This resolution presents
two issues for our consideration. The first
and wider one is whether it is desirable at
this time to make any changes to the end that
Canada will have the power to amend its
constitution. That is the broad general principle. Having considered that, if we answer
it in the affirmative a second question will

NOVEMBER

arise: Is the Government of Canada, in submitting this resolution for the purpose of
obtaining this power, going to work in the
right way, and, if parliament accedes to the
government's suggestion, will it be assenting
to the right method of achieving what is
desired? The first question relates to the
broad principle, the second to the method.
Let us consider first, the question: Is it
desirable, is it the wish of the people of
Canada, is it a beneficial and proper thing
at this time that we should say to the Imperial
Parliament, "In principle we desire to have
within our own jurisdiction the power to
amend our own constitution"?
That brings us in the first place to a consideration of the Statute of Westminster. As
all honourable senators know, that enactment
was the consummation of the Balfour resolutions passed at the Imperial Conference of
1926, which laid down certain broad principles affecting not only Canada but all the
dominions, and recognized their national
status as equal to that of the Mother country.
One of the very few limitations in the
Statute of Westminister with regard to our
status is contained in section 7, which
perhaps I should read at this time:
7.-(1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to
apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of
the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or
any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.

For the reason and necessity of this subsection, I refer to section 4 of the Statute of
Westminster, which provides:
No act of parliament of the United Kingdom
passed after the commencement of this Act shall
extend, or be deemed to extend, to a dominion
as part of the law of that dominion, unless it is
expressly declared in that Act that that dominion
has requested, and consented to, the enactment
thereof.

Subsection 2 of section 2 of that statute
reads as follows:
(2) No law and no provision of any law made
after the commencement of this Act by the parliament of a dominion shall be void or inoperative
on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of
England, or to the provisions of any existing or
future Act of parliament of the United Kingdom,
or to any order, rule or regulation made under
any such Act, and the powers of the parliament
of a dominion shal include the power to repeal
or amenc any such Act, order, rule or regulation
in so far as the same is part of the law of the
dominion.

So, under the general provisions of the
Statute of Westminster we were given power
to amend or repeal any Imperial statutes
that related to Canada, but by the special
provision in section 7, it was set out that this
should not apply to the British North America
Act. This was done, not at the instance
of the British Parliament, but, as honourable
senators can well understand, entirely at
the request of the Canadian Government.

1, 1949

It was our decision that it was preferable
to leave the Act as it was until such time
as Canadians were able to agree among themselves as to how they wanted the constitution
amended, and as to what safeguards and
restrictions should be put around it. Had
section 7 not been in the Statute of Westminster, it would have meant that the Parliament of Canada would have had power to
repeal any or all sections of the British North
America Act, merely by having a simple
majority. That would not have been in the
interests of Canada, and the question was
simply shelved. I say that advisedly, because
of a certain letter which was given prominence in yesterday's edition of the Montreal
Gazette, and to which I shall later refer.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would the honourable
senator agree that the Balfour resolutions and
the Statute of Westminster were the outcome
of the precedent that was set at the conclusion of the first World War in the signing of
the Treaty of Versailles by all members of
the British Empire individually? And did
this not leave them at that time with the term
British Commonwealth instead of British
Empire?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would not entirely agree
with that statement. I would not say it was
an outcome, but rather one of a number of
progressive steps. The Balfour resolutions
constituted a further step and the Statute of
Westminster was the culmination-or perhaps
I would be more accurate in saying that the
culmination will be reached when this resolution is passed and we have achieved an agreement on the other steps that will commence
on January 12.
Honourable senators, in advocating this
resolution today I must recall to mind-if
others do not do it for me-certain statements
I have made in service clubs such as the
Rotary Club, the Kiwanis Club and the
Canadian Club, and even at Liberal meetings.
I have made the statement more than once
that so far in the constitutional development
of Canada it has been fortunate for us that
the question of amendment of the constitution
has rested in the Imperial Parliament.
There are two factors which are most desirable in connection with the amendment of the
constitution. One is the flexibility necessary
to make amendments possible when they are
needed; the other is the security of minorities
and of the rights of all the people. Those are
the two essentials, and it is extremely difficult
for a nation to have them both. For instance,
our neighbours to the south have security but
not flexibility. It takes a two-thirds majority
of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, followed by two-thirds of the
states, to put through any simple amendment

SENATE
to the constitution. A most interesting contrast is what happened in Canada a few years
ago with relation to unemployment insurance.
The power to deal with insurance was vested
in the provinces, and it was desired by the
people of Canada generally that the constitution should be amended so that unemployment
insurance could be given effect to by the
federal parliament. This was logical, but had
we had a constitution such as that of the
United States we probably would still be
fooling around with it. What happened? A
general agreement was made with the provinces, and a resolution was passed through the
House of Commons and the Senate and wired
to the authorities in England, and inside a
week it became law. That was an example of
flexibility with regard to a matter in which
security was not the prime essential. The
rights of no person were being violated or
trampled on; but that could never have been
accomplished had we had a constitution
lacking flexibility.
On the other hand, the question of security
is even more important than flexibility. Had
we not had section 7 in the Statute of Westminster, under our present constitution the
House of Commons and the Senate, without
regard to the rights of provinces or any other
rights, by a simple majority could not have
sent a resolution to England and have it
become a statute of this country. There
would have been mighty little security to
justify that spirit of unity which exists in
Canada.
It is for these reasons that I have stated
more than once that our system has given us
flexibility, and at the same time as much
security, as any country could ask for. We
have possessed fundamental and basic rights
under our constitution, and we have also had
the guarantee of the House of Lords that no
amending statute to the British North America
Act would be passed to violate those fundamental rights. We have also had a spirit of
justice, a spirit of fair play, and a sense of
constitutional responsibility as vested in the
British House of Commons. Well, all good
things are bound to come to an end, and while
those conditions have been most fortunate for
us in Canada, in my opinion the time bas come
when we must look at the picture from a
different viewpoint. In the first place, the
House of Lords is today an impotent institution. Final proof of that was given only
yesterday in England when a bill was passed
providing that in just one year's time the
will of the House of Commons will over-ride
any objections that may be made by the
House of Lords.
Honourable senators, I should like now to
say a word about the British Parliament. I
am speaking in this chamber as a senator, so

I shall be careful about my remarks. All I
really wish to say is that each of us is entitled
to ask whether there is as much security in
that parliament in relation to our constitutional guarantees as existed in earlier generations.
To me, one of the strongest reasons why
at this time we should seek a change is
that we have been imposing a most serious
responsibility on the British government and
parliament long enough.
The potential
responsibility is perhaps greater than any that
bas actually developed, for some serious constitutional dispute might arise in this country
at any time. For instance, in some special
circumstances the House of Commons might
pass a resolution in which the Senate refused
to join, and the Commons might send its
resolution over to the Imperial Parliament
with the request that the voice of the elected
representatives of the people be listened to,
but that this body, which is not elected, be
ignored. Or there might arise an issue as to
which both our houses would pass a resolution that was strongly opposed by one or more
provinces, and a large body of provincial
representatives might be sent to England to
urge upon the Imperial Government that it
would be unfair to act upon the request of
the federal parliament. Think what a very
unpleasant predicament the British parliament and government would be placed in by
a dispute like that! Once we have achieved
our present status we have no right to ask the
Imperial authorities to continue to assume
that potential responsibility.
Then, honourable senators, the time has
come when, because of our own spirit of
national self-consciousness, our people as a
whole are insistent that we no longer humiliate ourselves by asking someone else to bear
a responsibility that is properly our own.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think one may say that
not only this house but the people of Canada
are almost unanimously agreed that the time
is ripe for agreement upon the principle that
Canada should have within her own borders
complete power to amend her own constitution.
If I have succeeded in expressing your
views so far, honourable senators, the next
matter we must consider is the wisdom of
this particular resolution, and not only of
this resolution standing alone but of the
resolution in relation to the policy proposed
by the government. The government has proposed that parliament accept this resolution
as part of a program. After the resolution is
passed here and after it is passed by the
Imperial parliament-as of course it will be,
without hesitation, when the request is

NOVEMBER

received from both our houses-the government will meet with the provinces to see how
far they can go by understand-ing and agreement to complete the program. The date set
for the commencement of the proposed meeting is the 10th of January next. I wish to
emphasize, although I know it is not necessary to do so in this house, that the important
part of the program lies in the future. I can
answer the question asked by my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) by saying that when you come to
examine the resolution you find that in reality
the principle that it establishes is wide and
important, but the actual effect of the resolution by itself is comparatively limited. Indeed,
I think that anyone who has not already
looked into it will be surprised to discover
how really limited it is.
May I say a word here as to my understanding of the reasoning advanced by the
government and particularly by the Prime
Minister? And first let me remark, honourable senators, that from any personal knowledge of the Prime Minister, from my
observation over many years of his activities
as a lawyer and of his conduct as Prime
Minister, I regard him as not only a great
constitutional lawyer, but as a great constitutional lawyer with a vision.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: As I follow the reasoning
of the government, and particularly that of
the Prime Minister, they are thinking of the
division of our constitution into three parts.
I should like us to think about it along the
same line. First, there is that part of the
constitution which is exclusively provincial
in character. Secondly, there is that part
of the constitution which is exclusively
federal, not only in its jurisdiction but in its
I particularly
application and its effect.
And thirdly
emphasize the word "effect."
there is the field, which is the big field, coinprising the middle ground where jurisdictions
overlap, so that it is impossible to touch one
without touching the other.
Honourable senators, especially those who
are lawyers-though lately we have heard
so much about the constitution that we all
are familiar with it-know that the two outstanding sections in that big field are section
91, the amendment of which we are now
seeking, and its counterpart, section 92. Section 91 enumerates powers given to the
federal parliament, and section 92 enumerates
powers given to the provinces. You cannot
touch a single power specified in section 91
without interfering with one specified in
section 92, and vice versa. So sections 91 and
92, and to a lesser degree some other sections,
which I shall mention later, are not within

1. 1949

this resolution. It is important for honourable members to keep that in mind. They
come within the third classification, which
will be dealt with at dominion-provincial
conferences later on.
Let me briefiy refer to each of these three
divisions or parts of the constitution. The
first relates to the powers already vested in
the provinces. Honourable senators will recall
that in the last few weeks there has been a
good deal of talk about lop-sided amendments
to the constitution, ragged amendments torn
down the middle, so that one almost gets the
idea that the constitution is like a tattered
picture hanging crookedly on the wall. Why?
Because the present proposal is to deal with
matters relating strictly to the federal part
of the constitution. But I submit to honourable senators that if there is anything in the
suggestion that the constiuion is being torn
into shreds and patches, that enormous
offence was first committed at the time of
confederation. I say that because section 92
of the British North America Act reads as
follows:
In each province the legislature may exclusively
make laws in relation to matters coming within the
classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated;
that is to say,1. The amendment from time to time, notwithstanding anything in this Act, of the Constitution
of the Province, except as regards the office of
Lieutenant-Governor.

This cock-eyed idea, this lop-sided operation, had its inception in the first clause of
Section 92 of the British North America Act,
which relates to the provinces. I wish to call
the attention of honourable senators to some
of the things which the provinces have been
able to do in the way of amending their own
constitutions ever since the day when the
Confederation Act became law. For instance,
section 68 states where the seat of government for each province shall be. Under section 92 (1) the provinces, from the very start,
have had the power to change the seat of
government. Even in Ontario the seat could
be moved from Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: A terrible thing.
Hon. Mr. Farris: We next look at section 70
of the British North America Act, which
reads:
The Legislative Assembly of Ontario shall be
composed of eighty-two members, to be elected
to represent the eighty-two electoral districts set
forth in the first schedule to this Act.

The province of Ontario has many times
changed that provision, and it will make
further changes. Under the power given it by
the British North America Act the government of that province, if it were in session
now, could change the provisions as to the
number of representatives to be sent to the
legislature, how many members should represent the city of Toronto and how many the

SENATE

surrounding areas. That legislature could
gerrymander-if I may use the word-or
manipulate the electorate to suit itself. Under
the power vested in the legislatures by the
British North America Act every province in
Canada has the same power. For example,
the provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick each had at one time legislative councils or second chambers. These
provinces, without any consultation or consent from the Imperial Parliament, and without asking leave of the Dominion Parliament,
amended their constitutions to abolish legislative councils in those provinces. They had
the jurisdiction to do it and they did it.
I do not think that the province of British
Columbia has ever had a legislative council,
but if it chose, it could set up such a second
chamber.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The province of Manitoba
had one.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I venture to say that
Manitoba never took the trouble to ask the
Prime Minister of Canada for permission to
abolish the second chamber. Had the province
been asked to do so, it would have replied
in very polite language, such as would meet
the requirements of the Montreal Gazette,
that it was no concern of the Prime Minister
of Canada, and that under the constitution the
provinces had the right to deal with purely
provincial matters. That is the basic principle
on which the British North America Act
started, with respect to the constitution of
the provinces.
We come now to the second division, which
concerns constitutional matters of a purely
federal nature. These are matters which are
not only federal in authority, but in effect.
The proposal that the Dominion seek, as a
first step in this progressive movement, to
bring the control of our constitution to Canada, is a most simple and harmless one. That
movement would give the Dominion power
to deal with federal matters in the same way
as the provinces, by right, have always dealt
with purely provincial questions.
I wish now to face some of the objections
which will be raised to this proposal. Every
day as I read the newspapers, and particularly the reports of speeches in other places,
I have been more and more surprised at the
ingenuity with which objections have been
raised. I say in all seriousness, honourable
senators, that the undertaking of a movement
of this kind ought to have behind it a spirit
of co-operation on the part of all Canadians,
rather than attempts to raise objections
against it. I have the faith to believe that
after the first flutter of concern has passed,
the dominating spirit of the people of Canada
will be behind the movement.

Some of the objections raised are worth
while, and it is essential that we give them
the utmost consideration. One theory which
has been advanced is that confederation itself
was a compact or a treaty and, for that reason,
cannot be changed without the unanimous
consent of all the parties to it, whether the
matters concerned be federal or provincial
or require the consent of all parties. There
are several answers to this criticism, and I
wish to deal with them. I may say that I am
now speaking not only in response to the
honourable leader's request that I explain
this resolution, which might to some extent
bind me to support government policy, but
also from the standpoint of my own personal
views.
To begin with, I think the theory that no
amendment can be made without the consent
of all parties is a startling proposition. Think,
honourable senators, of all the amendments
which have been passed, and what it would
have meant if assent had been required not
only of both houses of parliament but of
every legislature in Canada. The first answer
to the protest is that from 1867 up to date no
such theory has been recognized in practice.
After all, in constitutional matters practice
determines to a very large extent the meaning and understanding of the constitution. In
the Old Country, where there is practically
no written constitution at all, the whole basis
of operation, with the exception of habeas
corpus, is built on practice-the conventions
of the constitution. These have been explained
by Dicey and by Mr. O'Connor in the same
way. The conventions of the constitution
cover the things that should or should not be
done. They impose an obligation on parliament and all public men, just as if they had
been enacted by statute. They are the kind
of thing which causes an Englishman to say,
"We don't do that sort of thing, you know",
and that is the end of it. My understanding
of the question has been that, on the grounds
of good faith and where the honour of
Canada and the Imperial Parliament is
involved, the fundamental rights guaranteed
to the provinces and to minorities and classes
in the community, are not to be sacrificed in
subsequent legislation in amending the British
North America Act. That is the basis on
which these conventions of the constitution
have been carried out.
Let us see how this pact-treaty idea stands
examination. Who made the so-called treaty?
Of course it was not made by the Dominion
itself because there was no federation prior
to confederation: Canada was unborn and
could not be a party to it. It was not made
by Quebec and Ontario, because at that time
they had no separate status. They comprised
Canada, but not as a federal union. They

NOVEMBER
were combined in one parliament and formed
a legislative union. They did pass a resolution approving the Quebec resolutions, but
as I have just remarked, this assent was given
not by two independent provinces but by a
single parliament representative of the people
of Upper and Lower Canada. Then, who
made the treaty? Certainly it was not made
with the Maritime Provinces. The Legislature
of Prince Edward Island rejected the resolutions; it turned them down cold. The matter
was never submitted to the legislatures of
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Every constitutional authority that I have consulted
seems to agree that the essential feature of a
compact of this nature is the sanction of the
legislatures. No sanction was given; and it
is a good old rule, agreeable both to law
and common sense, that it takes two parties to
make an agreement.
Anyway, honourable senators, my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and myself, when we were discussing treaties before the Privy Council,
took the stand, that treaties can be made
only with nations. That view was sustained.
The parties must have the status of nations.
Today Canada has that status, but it did not
have it in 1867. Prior to confederation this
country consisted of only a little handful of
individual colonies-and colonies they were,
in the full sense of the word. They were not
in a position to make treaties. They were
empowered only to express approval or disapproval of legislation passed by the Imperial
Parliament, which alone had jurisdiction, and
on which alone rested the final responsibility
for legislation. So in my humble opinion,
which I am encouraged to offer because very
distinguished students of constitutional law
and history have expressed the same views,
there does not exist any compact constituting
an obligation of the nature of a treaty which
cannot be varied except by unanimous
consent. .
Hon. Mr. Euler: In that connection, may I
ask my honourable friend a question which
may be of considerable interest to other
senators? If, as he says-and I agree with
him-matters which fall entirely within
federal jurisdiction are wholly within the
competency of the Canadian Parliament,
would it be within the power of the Canadian
Parliament to abolish the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Canadian Parliament?
Yes, I think so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The agreement of the Senate
would be necessary?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Senate is a part, and
a very important part, of parliament. Some of
us might Ne willing to concede that it is the
most important part.

1, 1949

Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the answer I
expected.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My leader, who asked me
to move this resolution, knows that I hesitated
a long time before I agreed to do so, because
I wanted to convince myself that the resolution was right. There are things which a man
accused of being a partisan, as sometimes I
am, may be willing to do for his party; but I
cannot conceive of any senator supporting
this resolution if he thinks that as a constitutional proceeding it is unsound.
It
would take more than mere party loyalty to
induce him to do that.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: For my part, I pondered
this resolution a long time, until I had satisfied myself at least, that it was on a sound
basis and warranted our support. I see one
or two of my friends are smiling because they
know that what I am now saying has been
expressed privately to them. I have written
down what I believe to be the correct view
of this question.
It is not enough to say that there was not
a compact. One cannot ignore the fact that
most important and solemn obligations were
undertaken at the time of confederation. Nor
should it be forgotten that there was an
obligation on the part of Canada-of each
province-and of the Imperial Parliament to
recognize these obligations and see that they
were not violated. The authority to create
the Canadian constitution of 1867 was vested
exclusively in the Parliament at Westminster.
Nobody, I suppose, will dispute that statement. Neither by treaty nor in any other
way could the colonies at that time create
a union, either federal or legislative, between
themselves. The authority of the Imperial
Parliament was supreme. It carried with it
corresponding responsibilities and obligations
to legislate in the public interest of those to
be affected. In so doing the British Parliament gave effect to the wishes of the colonies,
as expressed to them by the representatives
at that time, not as the consummation of a
treaty, but as a statute enacted by parliament
to confer on those colonies a charter of union
and self-government, subject to such restrictions and limitations as the Act prescribed
and such obligations as necessarily go with
a statute of that kind.
Under this new constitution an entirely new
set of governments-one federal, the others
provincial-was
established.
Today the
government of Ontario is not in the same
form as government which existed provincially in Ontario before this legislation was
passed in 1867. The government of Ontario,
at that time was a part of Canada, itself
composed of two provinces. I reiterate that

SENATE
the legislative set-up which was created at
that time was entirely new. It is true that
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had separate parliaments; but they disappeared, and
a new parliament was created with new
powers as formulated in section 92 and other
provisions of the British North America Act.
Although in large measure the old machinery
was used, politically there was a new creation.
I think that consideration is basic to the
whole conception of the status of these provincial legislatures in relation to the new
creature then set up, the Parliament of Canada
as a whole, with a government here at Ottawa.
The electors were given the right to elect
members to the various parliaments-provincial and federal-to represent them in
These words
their respective capacities.
"respective capacities" should be underlined.
I can find no justification, either in the confederation records or in the practice since
adopted, for the statement that in federal
matters anyone has any jurisdiction but members of the federal parliament. It is unreasonable on its face to say that in matters relating
exclusively to the provincial constitutions the
provinces shall have full powers of amendment, and at the same time to argue that as to
similar matters of a federal nature the federal
representatives of the people, comprising the
Senate and the House of Commons, shall have
no right to seek a measure to give them full
powers within their own jurisdiction.
So much for the compact or treaty theory.
I have not exhausted it, and if I attempted
to do so I would only exhaust honourable
senators who, in the last analysis, would
form their own opinions.
The next objection that has been tossed
around-and it is difficult for me to treat it
with quite the same respect as I did the last
one-is the idea that it is a piecemeal amendment; that the constitution has been torn
down the middle and that the picture is hanging lopsided. I honestly believe that these
objections will be forgotten sooner than those
who uttered them.
In yesterday's edition of the Montreal
Gazette, a newspaper I read every morning
I am in Ottawa, there appeared two items
on the British North America Act, one a letter
and the other an editorial. The letter is the
most nonsensical thing I have ever read. It
was placed on the editorial page next to an
editorial criticizing the St. Laurent Government. To the casual reader, including myself, the inference would be that this letter
had the blessing of the editor. The letter
refers in part to section 7 (1) of the Statute
of Westminster and quotes as follows:
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to
the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British
North America Acts, 1867 to 1933, or any order, rule
or regulation made thereunder.

The writer states that this passage expressly
forbids any amendment to the British North
America Act, but that is not so. The amazing
point is that the learned author-at least he
seems to be learned, because he cites cases
and makes quotations almost as freely as
though he were learnedHon. Mr. Howard: He must be a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not know, but he
quotes from Mr. W. F. O'Connor, K.C., former
Parliamentary Counsel to this chamber. While
some of us did not always agree with Mr.
O'Connor, I would say to honourable senators, and particularly to my friend from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), that
I always held Mr. O'Connor in the highest
esteem. Anyway, the writer of the letter
ref ers to page 23 of annex 5 of Mr. O'Connor's
report to the Senate, 1939, which is a statement having nothing in the world to do with
the matter in question. At the same time he
entirely omits the next paragraph, which
completely covers the question and makes
clear that the Statute of Westminster has
nothing to do with this matter of amendment.
Yet we find this letter appearing in the
Gazette at a time when I am sure that newspaper is earnestly pleading for co-operation.
Honourable senators, the next criticism is
that one is not playing the game if one does
not deal with the constitution as a whole. It
is argued that the provinces must be consulted about all the amendments, whether
or not they are federal or provincial. This
view has considerable support, and although
I recognize it, I think it is quite wrong. Take
my own province of British Columbia-I do
not own it altogether, but I live thereSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I choose British Columbia
because it is far removed from the heated
controversies that are being waged in Ottawa.
The province of British Columbia does not
itself send representatives to the federal
parliament. The people who live in the
federal constituencies of British Columbia
are not citizens of that province within the
statute, but are citizens of Canada. These
people, regardless of any provincial boundaries, elect at the polls the federal members
whom they wish to represent them in federal
matters at Ottawa. Likewise, when British
Columbia vacancies in the Senate are filled,
the government appoints representatives from
British Columbia on a federal basis and not
from a provincial aspect.
As a distinct political unit under confederation, British Columbia, like the other provinces, has its own legislature and is assigned
certain defined powers. It is not given any
power to send representatives to Ottawa or
to concern itself with any matters outside its

NOVEMBER

thing to do with it, any more than the federal
parliament has to do with the power of a legislature to determine the number of members
required to constitute its assembly. Under
this amendment the federal government
would also have power to change the salary
of the Governor General. That salary is fixed
by federal statute, which could then be
amended by parliament. That is clearly a
subject with which no legislature has
anything to do.
Under this amendment parliament would
also have the power to limit the tenure of
office of Superior Court judges. Some people
wonder why it is that a judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada or of a county court must
vacate his office when he becomes seventyfive years of age, whereas judges of the
Superior Courts are not obliged to retire at
any specified age, but may continue on the
Bench for life. The reason is that our constitution provides that the judges of the Superior
Courts shall hold office during good behaviour.
After this amendment is passed parliament
will have the power, if it wishes to use it,
to decree a retiring age for Superior Court
judges appointed in the future.
Hon. Mr. Lesage: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to interrupt? While he
is enumerating the powers of parliament,
would he answer the question asked a few
minutes ago by the honourable gentleman
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), whether if
this amendment were passed the House of
Commons would have power to abolish the
Senate? I am under the impression that some
of the provinces came into confederation on
the specific understanding that there should
be a Senate, and that they would be represented by a certain number of members in the
Senate. Am I right?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I shall come to the Senate
in a minute, but for the moment I am dealing
with other matters. I am like the dentist who
bores all around the tender spot and leaves
that to the last. I was saying that our constitution provides that the judges of the
Superior Courts shall hold office during good
behaviour. At the present time, if parliament desire to specify a retiring age for
Superior Court judges it would be necessary
to amend the British North America Act, but
if the amendment contained in this resolution
is passed, parliament will of itself have power
to say at what age these judges shall retire.
Of course, there is no thought that parliament would repudiate any contractual obligation to any present judge, and if any bill to
do such a thing were passed in one house it
would no doubt be rejected in the other. But
parliament might decide to fix a retiring age
for Superior Court judges appointed in future.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable gentleman why the high court of first
instance in Ontario and some other Englishspeaking provinces is known as the Supreme
Court, whereas in Quebec it is known as the
Superior Court? That distinction in name was
not required by the British North America
Act.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Supreme Court of
British Columbia is the superior court in that
province. The narne "superior court" applies
to the nature and character of the court and
indicates its jurisdiction. The highest trial
bench in each of the provinces is the superior
court of that province.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: But what about the appeal
courts?

Hon. Mr. Farris: The appeal courts have
been created by an Act of the Canadian
Parliament, and not by the Act of confederation. Those courts are within the jurisdiction
of the Canadian Parliament. So far as the
superior courts are concerned, they are the
highest courts in the provinces, and at one
time exercised not only trial jurisdiction but
also appellate jurisdiction. In some provinces
they continue to be known as the Superior
Court, but in others they are called the
Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The name "Supreme
Court" would lead to some confusion, as the
Supreme Court of Canada will be the court
of final jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It would be better if the
various provincial courts could be known as
the "High Court of Justice", or by some
similar name. In that way references to the
"Supreme Court" would always relate to the
Supreme Court of Canada.
Honourable senators, let us now come to the
question of the Senate. There are two ways
of looking at this question. One is to look
at the section in the Act which excludes any
power of amendment. We are proposing by
this resolution to ask the Imperial parliament
to give Canada the power to amend its constitution, except in certain matters-the
classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the
legislatures. The best outline of these classes
is found in Section 92 of the B.N.A. Act,
where we find sixteen headings which relate
to subjects exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures. The powers which are
enumerated in section 91 are exclusively
those of the federal parliament. The two sections are so inter-related that one cannot
touch one without interfering with the other.
The next limitation of our power under this
proposal concerns the
. . . rights or privileges by this or any other
constitutional Act granted or secured to the legislature or the government of a province . . .

NOVEMBER
I have not entirely made up my mind, and I
do not intend to offer an opinion, as to
whether such a provision will exclude legislation to abolish the Senate. It may have
that meaning. I was much concerned about
that question at the first, but I will try to
show honourable senators why, in my thinking, I am not now so much concerned about it.
I point out that the resolution before us
today should not be considered by the Senate
in relation to its effect upon the Senate. It
should not be considered from the standpoint
that we are protecting our positions as Senators, because of course there is no danger of
the present body of Senators being thrown
out of office. It must be remembered, however, that this legislation, when passed, will
be in force for many years. We must therefore consider the fact that the Senate is a
protection to minorities and to classes in the
community, and it is our duty to see that that
protection is not lightly thrown away. If in
our consideration of this resolution we say
"You cannot touch the Senate", all honourable senators know what a protest would go
up all over this country. People would say:
"Those old fellows in the Senate are just
trying to protect their jobs and keep themselves in office for life." But if it is our duty
to assert ourselves, such a protest should not
stop us: it is highly important that the Senate
should not find itself involved in some issue
when popular opinion could be diverted
against it to the harm of our institution.
I would point out to my honourable friend
who asked a question earlier (Hon. Mr. Euler),
that when this legislation is passed the minorities and classes who look to the Senate for
protection will be better protected than they
are today. You may ask, why that is; what
protection is the Senate today? Suppose that
between now and the next general election
there was a financial crisis and times were
very bad in Canada, and there was a resentment against what is called capitalistic forms
of government; and suppose that a socialist
government were elected, which passed a
resolution in the House of Commons asking
for abolition of the Senate, and the Senate
refused to sanction it, the socialist Prime
Minister of Canada, fresh from the people,
with a good substantial majority, could have
no difficulty in going to the socialist government in England, where so much is now being
done about the House of Lords, and securing
the abolition of the Senate. Under those circumstances, I believe that we would not have
as much security as we had under a different
type of parliament, when the House of Lords
was really a factor in protecting rights.
Therefore, I say to my honourable friend that
at its worst this amendment by preserving the
Senate, will give more protection to the

1, 1949

minorities and classes in the community than
they would have if the question of Senate
abolition were left in the hands of the parliament as constituted in Great Britain today.
That brings us to the point where we must
decide whether we will go at least as far as
the resolution, or insist on going further and
thereby settle the whole question of the
Senate at this time. After most careful consideration I say that we should not go further
and place ourselves in a completely false
position. The propaganda which could be
worked up against the Senate would be used
to our disadvantage. But I repeat that, if
such action were necessary, there is no
reason why we should not do our duty
regardless of its effect on ourselves.
To further answer my honourable friend,
I ask these questions: Who says that the
Senate is a protection for minorities? Who
says it is a guarantee of provincial rights?
And who says that for these reasons the
Senate ought to be perpetuated? The answer
is: The people of Canada. And that may
include the premiers of the provinces. I
notice that Premier Douglas of Saskatchewan
has recently expressed himself in this matter.
No doubt Mr. Duplessis has some feeling on
this question, and the other premiers will
have views as well.
Then, when the
Dominion-Provincial conference takes place,
any provincial premier, cabinet minister or
representative who feels that the Senate is, as
we believe it to be, a security and a
guarantee to minorities, will have the opportunity of saying to the federal government:
"We want not only the security that the
Senate, in the matter of voting itself out of
office, will have to agree; we want the
further security that it be so tied up that it
can never be abolished." Those who feel the
necessity for the preservation of the Senate
could make such a demand. After giving
careful thought to the problem, it seems to
me that the best way in which existing
security can be made more secure, if further
security in that regard is needed, is to let
those who will get the benefit of that security
stand up and carry the fight into the conference of January 10 next, instead of
placing the Senate in the impossible position
of asserting itself at this time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: May I ask the honourable senator a question? If the amendment is
passed, will the government change its
method of appointing senators?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The government, with the
consent of parliament, can do so; but without the sanction of the Senate no change can
be made.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I have now dealt
with two of the three divisions of the constitution; first, that part which relates to provincial matters, and second, that part which
relates to purely federal matters. In January
there will be a conference of the political
leaders of Canada, provincial and federal, to
consider that great intermediate field where
one jurisdiction impinges on the other; and
it is highly essential that the approach should
be made in the spirit of full Canadianism and
not from a partisan or merely provincial
standpoint.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In this paper I have
already mentioned, the Gazette, I see these
words: "The only way is the friendly way".
To that I say yes, a hundred times. The only
way is the friendly way. But I submit, with
the greatest respect to this newspaper and
to others who support its views, that it is
not "the friendly way" to hatch objections
which have no validity. The way to approach
this question is with a full recognition of the
practical differences and distinctions between
provincial matters and federal matters, and
of those which overlap both. I know of no
man in Canada who bas a broader grasp of
these questions, is more sincere in his desire
to work out a solution, or bas more courage
to do something, than the Prime Minister of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If, when that conference
takes place, the premiers and cabinet
ministers of the provinces are animated with
that same courageous, broad-minded spirit,
we shall achieve for Canada something that
will be one of our greatest monuments, not
only to the nation but to the great leaders
who bring about that desired event.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
this is the first time that I have risen to speak
since the opening of the new parliament.
Like those who have preceded me, I wish
first to pay my compliments to our distinguished colleague who now occupies the
exalted position of Speaker of this house. All
of us, myself particularly, have rejoiced over
his appointment, and we all know that he
will most faithfully and ably perform his
important duties.
I have also a tribute to pay to the senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I
always listen to him with great interest, and
today I sincerely believe that he has surpassed himself in moving the adoption of the
motion which is now before this house.
To speak after our eminent colleague from
our Pacific province is a great honour, but
it is also a perilous task. I cannot emulate

his masterly command of the English
language and I cannot speak with the authority which he possesses, but in my own
Quebec accents I shall speak with ardent
sincerity from my truly Canadian heart.
In constitutional matters there are two
opposite schools of legal theory. There is a
conflict, two centuries old, between those
who put all their faith in written and
rigid constitutions, and those who, on the
contrary, adhere to the organic principle of
a flexible constitution. In a certain sense
this is the opposition between the advantages
and disadvantages of a code as against those
of the common law. I am a great admirer of
our Quebec civil code. I consider it an almost
perfect instrument for the administration of
private law. But in constitutional matters,
honourable gentlemen, I draw my inspiration
not from France, my mother country, but
from the great and venerable parliamentary
institutions which all Canadians, whatever
their origin, have inherited from Great
Britain. This is why I consider it a grave
error on the part of some of our opponents
to regard our constitution as being entirely
crystallized or, so to speak, codified in a
so-called pact or treaty, the British North
America Act. If we had accepted this view,
our constitutional structure would be of the
nature of a written constitution, so rigid that
it could not adapt itself to changing circumstances or adjust itself to our status as a
sovereign state, an international power. We
would be condemned to wear, perhaps forever, children's clothes as they were tailored
in 1867 for the then colonies or dependencies.
To try to stop the progress of our young
and robust Canadian nation in the name of
provincial autonomy or under the pretence of
safeguarding religious or racial rights, to try
to grant to any province the right of veto in
federal matters, is in my opinion an act
opposed to our national interests and to our
social well-being. It is indeed a shortsighted policy to ignore the fundamental law
of organic development. By .so doing one
would refuse to be reconciled to the idea that
our constitution is really and truly a living
organism which must continually and gradually change, which can never stand still, or
it would decay and finally perish.
I have been brought up and educated by
those who believe that our mission is to be
in the vanguard of our national progress, that
our task is to march steadily towards complete sovereignty, that our supreme satisfaction is to see our constitution grow and
develop like a gigantic and glorious maple
tree in this new world of ours.

NOVEMBER 1, 1949
With Lord Brougham I repeat that "constitutions must grow if they are to be of any
value; they have roots, they ripen, they
endure".
We are called upon today to consider a
motion for enabling our Canadian Parliament to amend the British North America
Act in purely federal matters. This fact
shows very clearly the steady progress of
our constitutional development. Personally
I think that the growth of our constitution is
due to a process of what may be called
natural evolution.
Why has nature followed here its normal
course? It is because, instead of having a
constitution of the rigid type, consisting exclusively of a solemn document, we have a truly
living and somewhat flexible, partly-written
constitution. This flexibility of our constitution
is due to that great body of unwritten principles and understandings which we have
inherited from our British parliamentary institutions. In his masterly work on the Government of Canada, R. M. Dawson proves very
clearly, at page 72, that our "unwritten constitution is every whit as important as the
British North America Act": indeed, much
of the British North America Act-I quote
again-"is transformed and made almost
unrecognizable by the operation of the
former,"-our unwritten constitution----"which
in all these instances consists of established
customs and usages which have grown up
over a long period of years." In other words,
much of the British North America Act bas
been transformed by precedents or conventions.
This is true of the process of transformation undergone by our parliamentary practice
since 1869, particularly in this matter of constitutional amendments. The British North
America Act on this point has been transformed by a series of long-established
precedents.
Originally, what was the effect of the
failure of the Act of 1867 to set up any general
machinery for its amendment?
Among
others, H. M. Clokie has stated, as appears at
page 31 of CanadianGovernment and Politics,
that:
Imperial control of Canadian domestic affairs was
secured by the British Parliament's power of
amending the constitution.
It was also believed that the necessity to
obtain an Imperial Statute to amend the
British North America Act was a safeguard
for provincial rights. Thus, in a statement
issued on January 31, 1936, on the question
of amending the Act of 1867, Hon. Mr. MeNair
asserted that "the provinces left the power
to change the confederation in the custody
and control of Westminster".

In matters involving the exercise of provincial powers, it is agreed that there should
be no attempt to effect arbitrary changes by
unilateral action of the Dominion Parliament.
Thus we may assume, for the sake of discussion, that provincial matters may be still to
some extent "in the custody and control of
Westminster". But, on tie contrary, as stated
by Mr. King in 1943-as quoted by the
Montreal Gazette of July 16 of that yearwhen the Parliament of Great Britain is
asked to amend the British North America
Act, in relation to federal matters, "such
amendments are made automatically and
without question on the request of the
appropriate representatives of the Canadian
people". Thus the constitutional amendments
of 1943, 1946, 1949, were adopted in London
as a pure matter of course and with a minimum of delay, simply on the joint address of
the two houses of this parliament. To quote
Clokie again at page 206:
From the British viewpoint it is clear that the
Dominion Government is the authoritative voice of
Canada ...
I may also say, as Dawson does at page 148,
that the present system imposes on the British
Parliament
. . . a thankless task, one in which it bas no responsibility, but which may at any time expose it to
criticism and attack from a dissatisfied province.
On July 10, 1940, the British Solicitor
General stated with weary resignation:
As a matter of mere legal machinery it is still
necessary, until some better method is evolved for
amendment of the British North America Act, for
the extension of the Canadian powers to be passed
by this parliament. But our parliament, in passing
such legislation, is merely carrying out the wishes
of the Dominion Parliament, and in that way the
legal position is made to square with the constitutional position

. . .

We must

operate the old

machinery which has been left over at their request in accordance with their wishes.
This passage is to be found in Hansard of
the British House of Commons, July 10, 1940,
at page 1177.
To sum up, the necessity to apply to Westminster for the authorization to amend our
constitution in purely federal matters has
become a pure formality; it cannot be now

construed as being a safeguard for anybody,
and it is a vestige of a former epoch which bas
become only an obsolete function. This
anachronism is quite incompatible with our
status as an independent and sovereign member of the community of nations. However,
those who oppose the present measure clain
that it should not be adopted because it has
not received the assent of the provinces. To
this argument I answer that as early as 18691871 the Canadian Parliament formally
rejected the theory that, even in federal matters, the terms of the British North America
Act can be amended only with the consent of

SENATE
the provinces. Macdonald and several other
Fathers of Confederation voted on two occasions against the resolutions requiring such
provincial acquiescence.
In order to show how our constitution was
interpreted by the Fathers of Confederation
themselves as early as eighty years ago, let
me quote an extract from the late Honourable
Norman Rogers, as it appears in 9 Canadian
Bar Review, 410. It is as follows:
When it was proposed to extend better terms to
Nova Scotia in 1869, it was argued very forcefully
by Edward Blake that this involved a substantive

change in the terms of confederation and ought to

be effected by the process of constitutional amendment, and Mr. Holton, on the second reading of the
bill, moved as follows:
That in the opinion of this house any disturbance
of the financial arrangements respecting the several
provinces provided for in the British North America
Act, unless assented to by all the provinces, would
be subversive of the system of government under
which the dominion was constituted. (See Journals
of the House of Commons (Canada) 1869, page 260.)
This resolution, which was in effect a formal
enunciation of the compact theory of confederation,
was rejected by a government presided over by
Sir John Macdonald and by a House of Commons
which included among its members not a few of the
delegates who had represented their provinces at
It is interesting to note
the Quebec Conference.
that the division lists reveal that Macdonald, Cartier,
Galt, Tilley and Tupper voted against the acceptance of the doctrine of unanimous consent as set
forth in this resolution. (See Journals of the House
of Commons (Canada) 1869, page 260.) Two years
later the question of provincial consent was revived
during the discussion of the draft bill which was
proposed to the Imperial Parliament for the purpose
of removing doubts as to the competence of the
Canadian Parliament to pass the Manitoba Act. On
this occasion, Mr. Mills proposed a series of resolutions protesting against the procedure followed
by the government. The last of these resolutions
was as follows:
That the representative legislatures of the provinces now embraced by the union have agreed to
the same on a federal basis, which has been sanctioned by the Imperial Parliament. This touse is of
opinion that any alteration by Imperial legislation
of the principle of representation in the House of
Commons, recognized and fixed by the 51st and 52nd
sections of the British North America Act, without
the consent of the several provinces that were parties to the compact, would be a violation of the

federal principle in our constitution, and destructive

of the independence and security of the provincial
governments and legislatures. (See Journals of the
House of Commons (Canada) 1871, page 254.)
This resolution contains the second definite assertion of the compact theory following the creation

provinces were not consulted....

Again, in 1875, 1886, 1895, 1915, 1916, 1930,
1943, 1946 and 1949, the British North
America Act was amended simply at the
request of the Canadian Parliament and
without any consent being obtained from the
provinces. In a series of a dozen of constitutional amendments, the consent of the
provinces was obtained only twice. The first
time was in 1907, after a Dominion-Provincial
conference, when the Imperial Parliament
adopted amendments increasing provincial

occurred, according to Dawson, at page 144,
"as a matter of political convenience and has
not become a governing precedent". Of the
seven subsequent amendments, only one
received prior provincial assent; that was the
amendment adopted in 1940 for the transfer
of jurisdiction to the dominion in the matter
of unemployment insurance. Why was the
consent of the provinces obtained in 1940?
Simply because the courts had decided that
unemployment insurance formed part of the
provincial matters contained in section 92
of the British North America Act.
The only conclusion which can logically
be reached is that the consent of the provinces must be obtained for amending section
92, which deals with the jurisdiction exclusively assigned to the local legislatures.
Nobody is now contesting this position. From
the ten precedents just enumerated and which
extend from 1871 to 1949, it follows that by
a long and well-established custom the Canadian Parliament has assumed for almost
eighty years the control and custody of our
federal constitution, and that the provinces
have never exercised nor enjoyed any effective right on our constitution in federal
matters.
But it is contended that such precedents
are bad precedents; that the British North
America Act is a "treaty" or "compact" and
should not be changed without the consent
of the contracting parties. I will not attempt
to add to what has been said on this head
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), but shall examine,
from a purely legal point of view, the question whether or not the British North America
Act can be called a treaty.
A treaty, in international law, is an agreement between two or more independent states.
But, as remarked by Clokie, at page 205:
Confederation was not based on a contract between individual sovereign states, it arose from poli-

tical agreements between dependent, though respon-

agreements were not incorporated in one document
deriving its authority from provincial ratification;
they were given legal sanction by a British statute.

Lower, at page 328 he affirms:
There can be no question of "consenting parties"
or a treaty; there were no consenting parties and
there could be no treaty; the Crown rearranged its
But, according to the genius of the
domains.
English tradition, it did not do so until it knew that
its act would be acceptable to those of its subjects
who were affected.

If the so-called Fathers of Confederation
had really given birth to a "confederation of
states", in the strict sense of that term; if
the three colonies had declared their independence and adopted true "Articles of Confederation," as the thirteen American states
did in 1781, then the constitution would be

NOVEMBER

in the nature of a treaty of alliance. In such
a case our provinces would have become
independent and sovereign states, international persons enjoying unimpared internal
sovereignty. But I share the opinion of the
late Honourable Norman Rogers, as stated
in 9 Canadian Bar Review, page 413 that;
The term "confederation" as applied to the Canadian union is a misnomer. What was actually set
up by the British North America Act was a federal
state or federation.

On that point I would also refer to Dawson,
at pages 33, 36 and 91.
I may add, honourable senators, that the
vague use of the word "confederation" has
created much confusion in certain quarters.
It has given rise to the theory that because
the provinces are sovereign in their own
sphere they are in al respects equal to our
federal state, and may be described as
sovereign states, in the fullest sense of that
term. On the contrary, it is evident that only
our central power is a sovereign state in
international law. Indeed, that Canada is
one country and not ten countries is a truism
which requires no demonstration.
At all events, the Quebec Resolutions
cannot, legally speaking, be described as a
treaty, because, as remarked by the late Mr.
Rogers, in 9 Canadian Bar Review, page 400:
There was no grant of powers to conclude a
treaty, compact or binding agreement. The colonies
of British North America had not acquired in 1864
the right to conclude commercial or political engagements either between themselves or with other
countries.

After fully discussing this matter, Mr.
Rogers concludes, at page 401, that delegations from the several provinces were simply
authorized:
. . . to confer on the subject of union in order
that the home government might have the benefit
of their advice before introducing the necessary
legislation in parliament. There was no grant of
authority to conclude a treaty, compact, or binding
agreement upon matters which had been dealt with
by the Imperial Parliament.

I wish now to repeat that in 1864-66 only
the Imperial Parliament had the power to
make a treaty or compact on behalf of the
British Crown with another state. When
Macdonald in 1865 called the Quebec Resolutions a "treaty", he meant, I believe, that
such resolutions constituted a tentative
arrangement arrived at on behalf of the three
provinces concerned-my reference is found
in the French edition of Mr. O'Connor's work,
at page 170-and that if the Quebec Resolutions as adopted by the delegates in 1864 were
not approved by the Parliament of Canada, it
would be necessary to obtain further approval
for any modification introduced by the unilateral action of the Canadian Parliament.
Macdonald was perfectly right in taking
that attitude. The Quebec Resolutions had

1, 1949

been tentatively agreed upon, and could not
be changed without the consent of all the
parties who had already subscribed to such
definite terms of union. However, I submit
that Macdonald was using the word "treaty",
not in its strictly technical sense, but figuratively, in order to describe the solemn draft
of a plan of union to which the delegates of
the provinces then contemplated giving binding effect by means of an Act of the Imperial
Parliament.
But in 1866 things in London took a turn
different from what Macdonald anticipated.
The delegates from the Maritime Provinces
declared that they were not bound by the
Quebec Resolutions. The London Resolutions
introduced substantial changes, and finally
the British North America Act contained
some further changes.
After 1866, as we have already seen, Macdonald, Cartier and other Fathers of Confederation refused to treat the British North
America Act as either a treaty or a compact.
To sum up, the Quebec Resolutions had to
some extent a conventional character from
the time of their adoption in 1864 until they
were replaced in 1866 by the London Resolutions. The London Resolutions, in their turn,
resulted from an agreement among the delegates, but they were modified and replaced
by the British North America Act. It remains
true that the Quebec Resolutions were used
as the main basis for our federation. In this
sense they were accepted in fact as a so-called
"treaty of union" among the then provincesCanada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. In
re Attorney-General for Australia v. Colonial
Sugar Refinery Company (1914) A.C. at 252-3,
the Privy Council stated:
The Canadian Constitution . . . when once enacted
by the Inperial Parliament, constituted a fresh
departure, and established new Dominion and Provincial governments with defined powers and duties
both derived from the Act of the Imperial Parliament which was their legal source.

Reaffirming its view just cited, the Privy
Council held, in re Bonanza Creek Gold
Mining Company v. The King (1916) 1 A.C.
at 579, that at the time of the enactment of
the British North America Act
. . . the constitutions of the provinces had been
surrendered to the Imperial Parliament for the purpose of being refashioned. The result had been to
establish wholly new dominion and provincial governments with defined powers and duties, both
derived from the statute which was their legal
source, the residual powers and duties being taken
away from the old provinces and given to the
dominion.

I know that some previous judgments of
the Privy Coundil may be cited in favour
of the treaty or compact theory, but I submit
that they are overruled by the more recent

SENATE
decisions and by the long parliamentary practice which I have already described concerning amendments to the British North America
Act in federal matters.
For all these reasons, I submit that the
proper distinction to make is the following:
The British North America Act resulted to
some extent fron the consent expressed on
behalf of Canada, Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick; but in form it is purely and
simply an Imperial Statute; it does not constitute "Articles of Confederation"-in which
hypothesis no amendment could be made
thereto without the consent of all the signatories.
Canada is not a confederation, and I wish
to remark here that the British North America
Act does not use anywhere the word "confederation". In the preamble there is a reference to the desire of the three provinces to
be federally united, and the term used afterwards in the Act is simply "union".
For all these reasons I am convinced, like
Clokie at page 193, and like Rogers and
Dawson, that Canada is a federal state, or
federation, not a confederation of states. I
am convinced also that in the British North
America Act, which created a federal state
with four original provinces, there are parts
which are of quite a different character.
Without trying to give an exhaustive list of
such essentially distinct parts in the Act of
1867, I may point to Part V, sections 58 to 90,
entitled "Provincial Constitution", and also to
section 92 entitled "Exclusive Powers of Provincial Legislatures". Such provincial constitution and provincial powers constitute for
our ten provinces acquired rights; and by the
present measure the Canadian Parliament will
not obtain any power either to amend the
provincial constitution or to take away from
the provinces any of their rights. Any Act
of our Canadian Parliament encroaching on
Part V or on section 92 would evidently be
declared ultra vires by our courts.
Again let me refer to section 93, respecting
education, and to section 133, concerning the
use of English and French. Such sections of
the British North America Act are intrinsically quite different from the sections which
concern exclusively our federal constitution,
namely, Parts III and IV. The motion before
us is expressly limited to federal matters and
expressly excepts all other subjects from its
scope. Thus, we do not touch any part of
the constitution which concerns provincial
constitutions, provincial rights or the protection of minorities. It would be highly improper for the Canadian Parliament to apply
to Westminster, without the consent of the
provinces, to obtain power to amend the
British North America Act in either of such
provincial or special matters. In other words,

any amendment of that part of our constitution concerning provincial matters, and
covering education and the use of both our
official languages, will continue to be subject
to Imperial enactments until we all agree on
a different procedure.
On the contrary, in purely federal matters
the effective control over amendments has
been exercised since 1871 by the Canadian
Parliament. As remarked a few years ago
by Clokie, at page 24:
The seventy-one year old practice of the Canadian
constitution, the solemnly expressed conventions of
dominion status, and the usage of fellow members
of the British Commonwealth of Nations all combine to show that the sovereign British Parliament
has now accepted a formal and technical role in
relation to Canada similar to that long held by the
Crown both in Britain and in Canada.

Dawson at page 146 refers
. . . to the very real conventional power of the
dominion parliament to request the passage of
amendments from the British parliament and the
obligation laid on the latter to follow this request.

Through the present Act we merely want
to remove the apparent contradiction now
existing ibetween legal procedure and actual
practice in relation to amendments in purely
federal matters. The Canadian Parliament
is simply asking for a power equivalent to
that of our provinces over their own provincial constitutions, as specified in section 92,
paragraph 1. Our provinces are mistresses in
their own houses. Let the Canadian Parliament be master in purely federal matters.
Until the present measure is adopted, as
pointed out by Dawson, page 138:
Canada occupies a somewhat humiliating position;
for after many years of insistence on her independent status, she is compelled to admit that she is
dependent upon an outside legislative body for the
exercise of one of the most basic powers of selfgovernment.

The further step which we are now taking
towards our full national independence and
sovereignty constitutes a great historical
achievement. The motion now before us does
not take away from the provincial legislatures
one iota of the jurisdiction which they now
effectively enjoy and exercise. We are only
obtaining formal sanction for the jurisdiction
already definitely recognized as pertaining to
the Canadian Parliament. We merely want
to set up a logical procedure, perfectly in
accordance with the principles affirmed by
a long series of precedents. In constitutional matters, honourable gentlemen, such
precedents acquire with time an irresistible
strength. I recall the saying of one of my
old professors that "law is to custom like the
moss which re-covers a stone". Today we
are simply asking the Imperial Parliament to
put in legal form our conventional practice
for three-quarters of a century.

NOVEMBER

In such purely federal matters, and on such
a question of convention, according to Clokie,
page 206, there is no legal obligation for our
government to consuit with the provinces.
Any attempt at such consultations would be
illogical; it would set back the dlock of time;
it would mean considerable delays; and judging from our past experience, it might even
resuit in a deadlock. The Dominion-Provincial conference will shortly be convenied for
studying plans to secure amendments to the
parts of the British North America Act that
are not covered by the present measure. This
is in every respect the proper course to
follow.
It does great credit indeed to our distinguished Prime Minister and to his colleagues. On this great national question Mr.
St. Laurent has shown a rare quality of
statesmanship, and hie deserves aur heartiest
congratulations. For this contribution to our
national maturity, our Prime Mînister will
pass into history as one of the great builders
of our Canadian nation.
I arn glad to support the adoption of the
historic measure now before us, which will

remain forever an outstanding landmark in
our constitutional evolution.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard the debate

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the
amendments be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
would respectfully suggest that the amendments be considered now. I think the honourable leader will develop a little more fully
the facts as to the time which already has
been devoted to this bill, not only this session
but during two or three previous sessions.
I would point out that unless we deal very
quickly with this bill and get it into the
House of Commons without much delay it is
likely to be stranded,Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -and we shall have it on
our hands again next session. I think it
rather essential therefore, that there be no
delay.
Honourable senators have heard the amendments to the bill, and while they may sound a
little mystifying, many of them are merely
routine, and I do not think that honourable
senators who were not on the committee need
worry about them.
There were two or three principal matters
to which special attention was given. One
pertained to the application of section 88 of
the Bank Act. Those who have had dealings
in business affairs will recall that sections 88
and 89 of the Bank Act are the two working
sections under which businessmen are able
to obtain loans from the bank on the security
of their floating assets. Section 189 of the
old Bankruptcy Act, which has been in existense for many years, provides that nothing
in that Act shall interfere with the workings
of sections 88 and 89 of the Bank Act. The
drafting of the present bill provided for the
deletion of section 189, and this would have
meant that the Bank Act might have been
affected. After careful consideration and the
hearing of representations, the committee was
unanimously of the opinion-and it was finally
concurred in by the Superintendent of Insurance-that section 189 should be restored.
This would mean that sections 88 and 89 in
the Bank Act would not be tampered with.
That was one of the most basic and important
amendments considered by the committee.
Another amendment has to do with the
copyright of books and other things of that
nature by authors at a time when the publisher has become bankrupt. Provisions have

SENATE
been made whereby, under certain conditions,
the author may recover his book if it has not
yet been published. If no expenditure has
been made by the publisher, the author may
recover his book almost automatically. If, on
the other hand, expenditures have been made
in connection with the publication, even
though the book has not yet been published,
the trustee is given a certain length of time in
which to decide whether he is going to proceed
with publication or not, and the author is likewise given a period of time to decide whether
he is going to take the book back. I think
honourable senators may rely on these provisions as being satisfactory.
The committee heard new representations
in addition to those already heard in previous years, and although the people making
them did not get all they asked for, I believe
they went away reasonably satisfied. At the
same time I am sure the Superintendent of
Insurance feels that none of the changes made
will seriously disturb the policy laid down by
the Department.
The committee held lengthy sessions, during which it went carefully into these matters.
In addition, there was a subcommittee, of
which the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) was chairman and the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) was a member. This subcommittee
spent a great deal of time with the Superintendent of Insurance and Mr. MacNeill, the
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the
Senate, going into a digest of the various contentious parts of the bill. The main committee then had the benefit of the subcommittee's
report, and was thus enabled to deal with the
matter in an effective manner, so I think we
are quite justified in dealing with these
amendments now.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Before the honourable leader speaks, would he allow me to
make a humble suggestion about this important measure? Many of us who are lawyers
feel that, for a number of serious reasons,
our Bankruptcy Act should have been
amended a long time ago. The honourable
gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), who has suggested immediate consideration of the amendments proposed in the
Banking and Commerce Committee's report,
said that senators who are not on that committee need not worry about these amendments. I am not worrying. In fact, as a
lawyer, I am ready to admit that the members
of that important committee, who are all
very capable persons, have done a good job.
But the common people have the right to
submit their views on this important piece
of legislation.
Ir my opinion, those of us who wish to do
so should have an opportunity to study the

complete bill, as amended, and not only in
the text in which it was amended but in the
French text, which I suppose was not studied
and amended concurrently with the English
text. Therefore I strongly urge that consideration of the report be postponed for a
period long enough to permit copies of the
amended bill to be printed in English and
French and distributed to every member of
the Senate. Unless we can study the bill as
amended, we cannot form an opinion as to
whether it is in the interests of the people.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) does not seem to be
in favour of my suggestion, but I would
point out once more that this is an important
piece of legislation, and that we have the
right to know what we are doing. My honourable friend may say, "If you were interested
in the bill you ought to have attended the
committee's sittings and followed its proceedings", but that argument would surely
not be allowed to override the feeling of
those who are not members of the committee
and who would like further time to study
the bill. Every senator who is not on the
Banking and Commerce Committee has the
right to have an opportunity to study the
amended bill carefully, in order to understand the full effect of what has been done.
I therefore urge again that consideration of
the amendments be postponed until next
week.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, there
is no question about my honourable friend's
right to a postponement. It is a fully recognized right and one that he does not need to
assert, for my proposal that the amendments
be considered today could only be carried
by unanimous consent. But in fairness to
myself I should like to point out that by far
the greater part of the bill was not amended
by the committee, and that the bill in substantially its present form has been before
this house for the whole of the current session,
as well as during the two preceding sessions.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: But were we furnished
with copies of it?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes. I am not opposing
my honourable friend's request that consideration of the amendments be postponed, for,
iinder our rules, there is no question about
his right to make that request. But if there
is any implication that I was trying to railroad the bill through, I wish to repeat that
the whole bill, except for these amendments
-and they are very trivial in comparison
with the great principles involved-has been
printed and distributed to every senator this
session, to say nothing of the two previous
sessions.

dence, was carefully considered before the
report was drafted. The honourable senator
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) made
representations on behalf of the Quebec Bar;
and we also heard from members of the
Canadian Bar Association. We went over all
the suggestions in detail, and discussed them
nith the superintendent.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Were all the suggestions
>f the Canadian Bar Association adopted?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, certainly not, but they
were considered fully. I am a member of
the Canadian Bar Association, and I know
that every single representation made by that
association was discussed. We had on the
committee such members as the honourable
senior senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), the honourable senator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo), and
the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Howard) three of whom are lawyers and
members of the Canadian Bar Association.
My only reason for rising at this time is
that I am afraid the other house will not get
through its business by early December.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has a long list of government measures before it, and I am concerned
for fear that this bill, which is very much
in the interest of Canadian business, will not
be passed this session; but if it is high enough
on the order paper in the other house, the
government will have to consider it.
I say quite candidly that the young man
who is now Superintendent of Bankruptcy
impressed me favourably, and I would be
pleased to see him administer this new Act,
which he has helped to frame, for the benefit
of the country.
Since 1946 I have been on every committee
that has considered the bankruptcy measure.
Further, I have personally interviewed all
the official receivers in the province of Manitoba. If a personal reference may be pardoned, I would add that my law office has
considerable bankruptcy practice, and I know
pretty well the sort of legislation that is
required.
When certain suggestions were
made before the committee I considered them
in the light of my own experience and what
the receivers had told me.
As far as the copyright provisions are concerned, the Canadian Authors' Association
made certain recommendations. Certain suggestions came from my friend's province, and
these were considered by the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), the
honourable senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) and myself. The Canadian Authors'
Association thanked us very kindly for the
amendment we proposed.

As to banking arrangements, we considered
the whole matter very fully. We submitted
questions to Mr. MacDonald, the superintendent, and he came before us and said that the
solicitors for the bankers requested certain
amendments. He suggested that it was perhaps better to restore certain provisions which
it was proposed to cut out of the present act,
and we adopted his suggestion unanimously.
Bankruptcy is a very intricate subject, and
I would hate to see this bill go over until next
session, particularly after the committee has
done so much work on it. Bankruptcy questions as between unsecured creditors, secured
creditors and the assignees, are always controversial. We have tried as best we can to
find a solution for the various problems, and
I would ask my honourable friend to withdraw his objection.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators, with
the indulgence of the house, I should like
to state more clearly my views on the subject, and to answer some remarks made by
the honourable member from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). My honourable
friends know me well enough to appreciate
that I have a high regard for the work done
by this committee. Nevertheless, I think that
all members of the Senate have a right to
know the details of such an important piece
of legislation before adopting it. I am acting
in a spirit not of stubbornness but of conscientiousness and I believe that I am in the
right. I have a responsibility to the ordinary lawyers-not corporation lawyers-who
are interested in this bill. In such an important matter it is the duty of this house to
protect the public by seeing that all of the
amendments are fully considered before the
bill is passed.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), for whom I have the highest regard,
surely will not force my sentiments to the
limit by asking me to withdraw my objection.
I understand very well that I have the right
to prevent the passing of this bill now, but
I do not wish to use my power arbitrarily.
I only wish to make sure that the members
of this house have an opportunity to at least
look over these amendments before they are
passed. I was surprised to hear the honourable senator from Vancouver South refer to
the amendments as minorHon. Mr. Beaubien: He did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: -although,
he said, it
took three years to pass them.
Hon. Mr. Farris: When I said that amendments were of a minor nature I referred to
some of those that were read at the table
today. I did not say that all were minor.

NOVEMBER 2, 1949
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I am glad to have my
friend's explanation. I wish him to know
that I have never made the suggestion that
he intended to railroad the bill. My only
thought in raising these points is that such
an important measure should not be passed
by the Senate without proper consideration.
This house, which is composed of persons of
high reputation, is not always regarded by
the public as it should be; therefore it is
most important that we take the proper time
to consider this measure. I do not insist
that consideration of the report be postponed
until next week, but I beg the house to give
me an opportunity of looking over the amendments between now and tomorrow afternoon,
when the report of the committee can again
come before us.
Consideration was postponed.

SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 2,
an Act to amend the Supreme Court Act.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, we have had a very interesting and
informative debate on the question of amendments to be made to the Supreme Court Act
to the end that the Supreme Court of Canada
shall become the court of ultimate appeal
for Canada in civil matters, as it is now in
criminal matters. My only justification for
speaking-and I intend to be brief-is the
importance of this subject and the implications involved in constituting the Supreme
Court of Canada a court of ultimate appeal.
This bill marks another break with the past,
but it also marks another step on the way to
a completely autonomous nation. Needless
to say, there will be nothing in my remarks
to indicate that I have anything but unqualified support for the action which is now being
taken. If I were to voice any criticism, it
would be that the measure should have come
much earlier.
In the course of discussion in this chamber
a number of points have been considered.
There is one to which I should like to refer,
very briefly, in order to clarify the situation.
I have in mind the doctrine of stare decisis,
to which reference has been made by several
senators in the course of their speeches.
The Canadian Bar Association at its annual
meeting passed a resolution one of the provisions of which referred to this subject.
Translated into ordinary English, stare decisis
means that a court will be bound by previous
decisions, or that the results of decided cases
will be reflected in subsequent judgments of
the court. What the Canadian Bar Association recommended, in the course of its resolution dealing with this subject-matter, was
that the rule of stare decisis should continue
to be applied with respect to past decisions of
the Supreme Court as well as past decisions of
the Judicial Committee. When, subsequent
to the publication of this recommendation, the
amendments to the Supreme Court Act were
introduced in another place, the president of
the Canadian Bar Association gave an interview in which, dealing with this point of
stare decisis, he had this to say:
I wish to make particular reference to this recommendation, for I regard It as of vital importance.

SENATE
It is true that the resolution of the Canadian Bar
Association does not provide specifically that this
recommendation should be given statutory effect,
but I fail to see how it can be made completely
binding otherwise than by statute.

As a result of the resolution of the association
and the interview given by the president, a
body of thought has been developed on the
assumption that the Canadian Bar Association recommended not only that the principle
of stare decisis be established but that it be
embodied in this amending bill. Under these
circumstances I think this chamber should
know that the resolution which the Canadian Bar Association passed was the result
of a consideration of the subject by a number
of outstanding Canadian lawyers, and the
discussion of their report by the association.
But that same committee of learned gentlemen had interviewed as early as April of
this year the responsible officers of the
Department of Justice, and subsequently put
in the form of a letter the substance of their
recommendations in connection with this very
subject matter. If you check the contents of
their letter with the contents of the resolution
of the Canadian Bar Association, you will
see that they agree very closely, except for
one statement communicated to the meeting
of the Canadian Bar Association to the
effect that nothing should appear in the
statute with relation to the stare decisis rule.
That was the majority view of those lawyers.
My reason for emphasizing this fact is that
we sometimes hear the opinion expressed
that we should make this doctrine effective by
Statute so that the Supreme Court of Canada
may hereafter follow this principle. In my
opinion this would be a bad thing, because,
owing to the many situations involved, the
only rules we could work out would be a
never-ending series of pronouncements. For
instance, suppose the Supreme Court of
Canada, after becoming the ultimate court of
appeal, gave a judgment on a certain subject
matter, and that in the next year the same
subject matter came up before the Privy
Council or the House of Lords, and a different
ruling was made, what would be the rule
thereafter to bind the Supreme Court? Should
it follow its own previous judgment, the
judgment of the Privy Council, or the judgment of the House of Lords? How would
this affect the courts of appeal in the various
provinces? If you had the situation occurring
that I have cited, in what direction would
the appellate courts in the provinces go?
Would they follow the decision of the House
of Lords, that of the Privy Council, or that
of the Supreme Court? As I say, there would
be a never-ending series of rules that would
be changed from year to year.
My own opinion is that if we have sufficient
confidence in our ability to establish and

maintain a court of ultimate appeal in
Canada, we should have sufficient confidence
in those persons who may from time to time
constitute the membership of that court to
believe that they will continue to exercise
their understanding and wisdom in the
administration of Canadian justice.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Suppose the Supreme Court
of Canada made a decision on a certain
matter, and in ten years' time a somewhat
similar question arose, what would be the
binding effect of the former decision of the
Supreme Court?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is a tough one.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I want to warn you
right now that anything I may have to say
will not be binding on the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I also wish to reserve the
right, in the light of future circumstances, to
reach a different conclusion. Having thus
protected myself, I would say, on the analogy
of the Privy Council, that if the Supreme
Court of Canada, were to render a judgment
on a certain subject matter, and a similar
question were to arise at a future date, unless
there were certain changed circumstances,
the court, exercising reasonable judgment and
common sense, would follow its previous
decision. However, it is one thing to say it
would, and it is another thing to say it must.
A court of ultimate appeal must have a certain
flexibility so that some consideration may be
given to changing circumstances.
Let me illustrate further. When the honourable senator for Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) gave his careful and critical
analysis of the attitude of the Privy Council,
I did not gather that he was criticizing or
challenging the judicial integrity of that body.
What I understood him to mean was that in
the approach to the statute and the interpretation of our constitution there should be
some degree of flexibility; that consideration
should be given, not to a mere bag of bones,
but to custom and changing conditions. As
I see it, his only criticism-if you can call it
such-was that the people who are best
qualified to pass final judgment are those who
possess the necessary judicial integrity and
who live in Canada and are familiar with
Canadian atmosphere. As I understood his
speech on that point, it went only that far;
and I am in agreement with it.
As to the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), I have no
quarrel with his energetic exposition of the
merits of the Privy Council. I would not think
of suggesting that the members of the Privy

NOVEMBER 2, 1949
Council did not possess the capacity to deal
with legal problems with knowledge and
judicial integrity.
While I enjoyed the
speeches of the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) I was not at all moved by their
remarks, because the question of whether or
not Canada should have a court of ultimate
appeal is not something I must look at through
the eyes of the Privy Council or any other
person who is occupying a position outside
Canada.
I am only concerned with the
question of whether we are taking a step
which is in the best interests of Canada,
having regard to our present national and
international stature. Is it best for us at this
time to set up a final court of appeal in Canada
to hear civil as well as criminal cases? I do
not think there should be much trouble in
answering that question. If in world affairs
we are claiming and asserting our rights as
a nation, and if we are acquiring an international status, then I say it behooves us not
to place ourselves in a position similar to that
which we held in an earlier period of our
history, when we were a colony and inferior
in status to other countries as weil as to
Great Britain.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I illustrate how in
the course of the years the fervour for nationhood in Canada welled up to a certain point,
then subsided a bit, and then came on again.
If you study the history of Canada down to
the time of the Statute of Westminster, you
will find that we went through an evolution
in the attainment of responsible government
and greater power in the management of our
own affairs. In 1906 we took it upon ourselves to say that the Supreme Court of
Canada was the ultimate court in criminal
appeals. But the Privy Council, in a decision
handed down in 1926, in Rex v. Nadon held
that we had gone too far. It held that since
the British North America Act was an
imperial statute, and that since there were in
existence when it was passed two other
imperial statutes-the Judicial Committee
Act of 1833 and the Judicial Committee Act of
1844-which gave Canadians, under royal
prerogative, the right to appeal to the Privy
Council, the only way of excluding that right
was by the passage of another imperial statute.
But in the Nadon case the same result was
achieved by refusal of the Privy Coundil to
grant leave to appeal.
In 1931, under the Statute of Westminster,
we took unto ourselves almost the full
attributes of nationhood, but we hesitated to
assert the right to amend our own constitution. In the Nadon case the Privy Council
held that section 1025 of the Criminal Code
45785-16

was ineffective to make the Supreme Court of
Canada the court of ultimate appeal in criminal cases, and at the session of 1932-1933 we
repealed subsection 4 of that section, which
by then had become section 1024, and immediately re-enacted it. The effect of this repeal
and re-enactment was to constitute the
Supreme Court of Canada, in 1933, the final
court of appeal in criminal matters. But we
did not take at that time the further step of
abolishing the right of appeal to the Privy
Council in all cases.
Then we started to lag. We went through
a period when there was introduced in the
House of Commons a private bill to make the
Supreme Court of Canada our court of last
resort. This was followed by a reference to
the Supreme Court of Canada on the question
whether we had the power to pass such legislation. Then we went through the period of
war, when there was a welling-up of the
spirit of complete independence that had
necessarily developed out of the position that
we assumed at the outbreak of hostilities.
Finally, in 1946, the Citizenship Act was
passed. We had at last reached the stage
where our pride in and love of country
demanded expression in a form that would
show the world that we were citizens of this
distinct and independent country, Canada.
We are now taking the further step of
abolishing all right of appeal to the Privy
Council and, through the resolution which
was moved here yesterday, of obtaining the
power to amend our own constitution.
All these actions are natural and inevitable
steps in the constitutional development of
Canada. There is no turning back now. We
must either abandon our nationhood or stand
forth before the world as a nation free and
independent, capable and sufficient unto
itself to manage its own affairs, in judicial
and constitutional as well as in all other matters. We must either accept the full responsibilities of nationhood or fall by the wayside
and remain inferior to other nations in fact
as well as in outward appearances.
It seems to me, then, that the question is
simply whether we are to go forward as a
nation or be bound by an adherence to the
past. I agree with a remark made in 1895
by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in a speech to the
Harvard Law Club:
There is, too, a peculiar logical pleasure in making
manifest the continuity between what we are doing
and what has been done before. But the present
has a right to govern itself so far as it can, and it
ought always to be remembered that historie continuity with the past is not a duty, it is a necessity.

I submit that to the historic past we owe
no tribute except such as may be induced by
necessity. None can be dictated by duty, for
our duty is to the present, to ourselves. We

SENATE

must recognize the fact that Canada is now
a nation, and aim at developing our internal
structure and constitution so as to make that
fact clear to the world.
Having regard to the adrnittedly important
position that Canada today occupies in international affairs-a position that we have
achieved for ourselves since confederationit is idle for us, in the kind of world in which
we now live, to make pretensions of nationhood so long as we retain some of the habiliments of a colonial and juvenile status. If
we are in fact a full-fledged nation, let us
get rid of those habiliments, not in a spirit
of hate or destruction, but simply because
they are no longer useful, necessary or desirable for us. Let us discard them at this time.
Let us pay tribute, if we will, to those who
helped us in the past, in the period of our
growth and development, but at the same
time let us remember that our duty now is
to endeavour to build up Canada, so that
it may become an even greater and better
country than it is at present.

He said: Honourable senators will recollect

that when the honourable senator from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) presented to this
chamber on June 26, 1948, the report of the
special Joint Committee on Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms, he laid on the
table a resolution adopted by the International Commission on Human Rights at Lake
Success on June 18, 1948. That document will
be found recorded at page 683 of the Debates
of the Senate for that year. The senator from
De Salaberry will also recollect that the Lake
Success resolution followed, in somewhat
condensed form, the International Declaration on Human Rights adopted at Geneva on
the 17th of December, 1947. Canada voted
for that resolution. The draft bill, which
constitutes part of the resolution I have just

moved, is an adaptation of these two documents to suit the Canadian situation and the
purpose in hand, and is drawn by the officers
of a committee for a Bill of Rights, of which
Mr. B. K. Sandwell, editor of Saturday Night,

of Toronto is president, and Mr. Irving Himel,
a well-known and active barrister of my
city, is secretary. The committee's membership includes many men and women of prominence and distinction resident throughout
Canada, from Vancouver to Antigonish.
I am one of the very many in Canada who
advocate the principle of human rights and
fundamental freedoms. I believe that everyone is entitled to live his life in his own way,
to express his thoughts as be may see fit,
alone or in association with others, and to be
protected by the state in his personal freedom
from all domination or oppression by others,
including the state. And so I have readily
consented to move this resolution, which I
understand will also be presented to the
governments-or the legislatures, if any are
in session-of the provinces throughout
Canada.
The joint committee of the Senate and
Commons held sittings in two sessions of parliament and finally reported, in effect, that
the power of the Dominion Parliament to
enact such a statute is disputed, and, accordingly, the committee did nothing and accomplished nothing. I expressed my disappointment at that time in unmistakable terms. The
reason for inaction given by the committee
was the difficulty inherent in the federal
system of divided jurisdiction. The difficulties
are admitted, though a very large field for the
enactment of such legislation is reserved to
the Dominion Parliament. It may be conceded, however, that no truly comprehensive
bill of rights, applicable under all circumstances, could be enacted by the Dominion
Parliament alone without infringing the
provincial jurisdiction.
Technical difficulties do exist, but in my
judgment they are not a justification for total
inaction. Since the member for De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) prepared the report to
which I have referred, two notable developments have taken place which make this an
opportune moment for progress. First, the
Dominion Parliament is about to assume the
right to amend the Canadian constitution
with respect to matters exclusively under
dominion control; and second, on the invitation of the Prime Minister of Canada, representatives of the provincial and dominion
governments will meet in conference in January next for consideration of the whole subject
of the enactment of constitutional amendments. Under the circumstances, honourable
senators, is it too much to ask that these
spokesmen for all parliamentary jurisdictions,
when assembled, consider the most vital of all
subjects, the preservation of the human rights
and fundamental freedoms of our people?
The Prime Minister is himself much interested in this subject. Speaking in Montreal

NOVEMBER 3, 1949
on October 13 last, he said that the move to
transfer to Canada the right to amend the
British North America Act would give a
greater guarantee of provincial jurisdiction
and minority rights than ever before.
Minority rights are human rights, and the
only legislative guarantee of fundamental
freedom which Canadians now possess is to be
found in the British North America Act. The
right to use the English and the French
languages is preserved by section 133; the
right to separate schools, by section 93; that
sessions of parliament shall be held annually,
by section 20; that there shall be a new parliament every five years, by section 50; the
right to representation by population, by
section 51; and to an independent judiciary, by
section 99. These are among the most important of our freedoms; and the addition of the
matters mentioned in my resolution, to the
human rights and fundamental freedoms
already guaranteed by the sections to which
I have referred would not change the basic
character of the act, but would greatly
enhance its usefulness.
The present, while amendments to the Act
are in contemplation and a dominion-provincial conference on the subject is pending,
would seem to be a most opportune time for
an effort by the Senate of Canada to make
progress in this important field.
That a bill of rights in Canada is desirable,
goes almost without saying. I refrain from
an enumeration of occasions when the elementary rights of individuals and classes have
been violated, lest I divert attention from the
subject in hand by a seeming criticism of the
persons concerned.
But each honourable
senator has at least one such instance in his
mind. I agree with the joint committee of
the Senate and House of Commons, that
"Canadians enjoy a large measure of civil
rights and liberties." I think that Canada
today is the freest nation upon the earth, and
in that I do not except either the United
States or Great Britain. I do not believe,
however, that we have reached perfection, or
anything like it. I also agree with the joint
committee in its statement that these rights
and liberties "must be maintained", and I
might add that they must be extended. I am
not prepared to concede that our freedom is
out of danger. We Canadians have been so
used to accepting our freedoms as a matter of
course, that sometimes we are in danger of
forgetting the old saying that eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty.
The present generation of Canadians have
been through two great wars, periods of stress
and crisis in which the safety of the nation
overshadowed for the moment the rights of
the individual, and in which our organization

for total war necessitated an economic planning and control to an extent previously
unknown. The danger now is that these
encroachments on individual rights may
become permanent. Canada has been reasonably free from witch-hunts by the majority,
directed against those holding unorthodox
views, and against racial or national minority
groups. There are, however, incidents which
I could mention, and which sound a warning.
A bill of rights may well ward off the dangers
which I see before us, and all around us. It
may directly prevent violations of right, by
court action; and indirectly, by its declaration
of what is expected in this land of freedom,
it may obviate even the attempt at violation.
The special Joint Committee reported that:
Respect for and observance of these rights and
freedoms depends in the last analysis upon the convictions, character and spirit of the people.

With that, of course, I thoroughly agree.
An informed and vigilant public opinion is
a major factor in preserving freedom. But
public opinion, honourable senators, is a matter of education. Can one measure the educational value, to this end, of a Bill of Rights
as part of our constitution ever declaring in
authoritative tones the high standard of
Canadian freedom? We have recently defined
Canadian citizenship. In the coming decades,
in all probability, thousands of immigrants
will be added to our population. One can
imagine how the children of these people will
learn in our schools the significance of
Canadian citizenship, and will experience its
sense of security, together with an understanding pride in our free institutions, provided only that we have the vision to declare
these noble conceptions to be part of our
fundamental law.
I shall not attempt to discuss the many
items contained in this draft bill. If I did so,
my speech could not be compressed into one
day. I did not write the bill. It was drawn
by the statesmen of many countries; it is the
product of much thought and discussion at
the United Nations; and it was further considered and revised with a view to Canadian
conditions by the Canadian Committee for a
Bill of Rights. I have accepted the text as
the most authoritative available, and all that
I ask is that the measure which I have proposed as a basis of discussion be given, at
least, consideration.
It will be observed that the Canadian Committee has not included in the proposed Act
any reference to economic rights and freedoms, such as the "right to work", which
involves the right of access to the gifts of
nature, and without which all other rights are
illusory. I think I should make some reference to the right to trade and to unhampered
exchange. The fact that these and other

SENATE
rights which are purely economic are not
included in this bill is no indication that those
who are fathering it regard them as
They are omitted because
unimportant.
economic freedom of that kind is a matter for
positive action by governments, and their
achievement is quite different from the negative prohibitions against initerference with the
political and personal rights of the individual,
which have been included. Thus there are two
different divisions of the progess which I
think we should make: one has been omitted
from the bill; the other is embodied in it as
fully as possible under the circumstances.
May I repeat that all I ask is that the
motion be considered. I feel sure that honourable senators in view of the nature and the
comprehensiveness of the subject, will not
deny me that. I suggest that the resolution
should be referred to a committee, say the
Committee on Immigration and Labour,
which is perhaps the most appropriate body
for the purpose. There it can be considered,
and, if this course be thought wise and meet,
the substantive motion, that it be referred to
the coming conference for further consideration, be concurred in.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: I rise to second the
resolution proposed by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I think he is to be commended for his study
of this subject and for presenting it to us in
concrete form. However, I do not second his
resolution with a feeling of unqualified
assurance, because, I must admit, my knowledge of the matter is too limited. The resolution contains eighteen distinct articles, having
various meanings, and it seems to me that more
thought than I have been able to give to it
would be necessary before one could vote upon
it. I pay tribute to the eminent source from
which the resolution comes, but as a humble
member of this house whose responsibility in
approving or disapproving these articles rests
within himself alone, I should like to have

additional information.
articles about which I am enthusiastic, and
others about which I am not so sure. For this
reason I think the proper way to deal with
the resolution is to follow the suggestion of
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity,
and refer the subject matter to committee for
study.
A Canadian bill of rights is something
which has been discussed in the other place
as well as throughout the country. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity has
said that Canada is the freest country in the
world, bar none, and I agree with his statement. The inspiring national anthem of our
American neighbours ends with the note that
theirs is "the land of the free and the home

of the brave". With this we would agree, but
at the same time I am sure we sometimes feel
that their constitution is rather rigid and that
we possess freedoms, through our flexibility,
which they do not have.
The resolution, in substance, comes from
the League of Nations, and is therefore an
agreement of many countries. That being so,
there may be an element of compromise: it
may be that if Canadians are the freest people
in the world we would be surrendering something by adopting all the articles of this
resolution. By adopting a bill of rights specifically defining our freedoms, we might be
restricting rather than advancing the objectives we have in view.
I have been reading a book entitled British
North America Acts and Selected Statutes,
1867-1948, at the beginning of which there is
a note which reads, in part, as follows:
This is a new edition of the "British North
America Acts and Amendments" published by the
King's Printer in 1943.
All this material has been brought together,
selected and annotated by Dr. Maurice Ollivier,
K.C., F.R.S.C., Joint Law Clerk of the House of
Commons, for the convenience of parliamentarians,
civil servants, and more specially for the benefit of
students of the Canadian constitution.

I now read from page 29, where it says:
Here we might ask ourselves what is a constitution and we will find that it is the fundamental law
of a state directing the principles upon which the
government is founded and regulating the exercise
of the sovereign powers, directing to what bodies
and persons those powers shall be confided and the
manner of their exercise.
Amongst the distinctions to be established in constitutions we should mention that of-written and
unwritten constitutions. These words however should
not be taken too literally as in a country which is
governed by a written constitution much of the constitutional or fundamental law is unwritten and is
to be found outside the written document called:
"The Constitution" for instance amongst the constitutional conventions which have really the force
of law. On the other hand a country has an unwritten constitution when the constitution is not contained in a single and overriding document, which
does not mean, however, that no part of this constitution is written. In countries like England for
instance it has been said that the country did not
have a constitution because it could not produce a
written document called the Constitution; "however
there is no doubt that there exists an English
constitution, which any student of history may
recognize and admire, composed of a limited number
of conceptions and privileges granted by the kings
of the earlier periods of certain great leading principles admitted at different times and transmitted

many other statutes. It is composed also of traditions, customs and constitutional conventions. It
means freedom to think, to live, to worship and to
work out our destiny as men and women who have
a great mission and a great responsibility and
obligation." The English constitution is part of our
own from the very preamble of the B.N.A. Act
where it is stated that the provinces have expressed
the desire to be federally united with a constitution
similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.

NOVEMBER 3. 1949
Section 129 of the British North America
Act refers more definitely than that to certain
provinces in Canada. I believe that the
constitution of this country should not be
lightly framed or lightly changed. I have
no doubt that those who will be responsible
for the framing and changing of the Canadian
constitution will ensure that it possesses a
high degree of stability. It must be realized
that the items in this resolution refer largely
to matters of property and civil rights, which
properly belong to the provinces.
This
resolution deals with an important matter,
and in view of approaching events, of which
we shall need special knowledge, I think it
proper that it should have been placed before
the Senate at this time. So, with the reservations I have outlined, I have pleasure in
seconding the resolution, and I hope that it
will be referred to the appropriate Senate
committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien the
debate was adjourned.
BANKRUPTCY BILL
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the amendments made by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill F, an Act respecting Bankruptcy.
Hon. A. B. Copp: Honourable senators,
in the absence of the chairman of the Banking
and Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr. Farris),
I move concurrence in the amendments made
by the committee to Bill F, an Act respecting
bankruptcy.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill, as amended, be read
the third time?
Hon. Mr. Copp: With leave of the Senate,
now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
AMENDMENT
ADDRESS

TO HIS MAJESTY-MOTION

On the order for resuming the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, that
an humble Address be presented to His
Majesty, requesting an amendment to the
British North America Act, 1867.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I had
hoped to be able to speak this afternoon,
but I have had so much work to do that
I am not ready to go on. If any other senator

wishes to continue the debate now, I am
quite willing that he do so, and I will avail
myself, not of the rule, but of the practice
that would permit me to adjourn the debate
further. I do not want to prevent anyone
from going ahead at this time.
Hon. Mr. Copp: I had hoped, as my honourable friend opposite did, that we should be
able to proceed with the debate on this
important resolution today. I understand
that other senators wish to speak. It is
desirable to have the resolution passed this
afternoon, if possible, in order that we may
adjourn over to next week. I fear that if
the debate is not concluded today we shall
have to sit again tomorrow. Any other
honourable senator who is planning to participate in the debate may speak now.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
I had hoped to be able to add a word or
two to the valuable contributions that have
already been made to this debate, but I
must say that my thoughts on the matter
have not yet been crystallized, and I am not
yet sure just what the scope of my remarks
should be. In the circumstances I would
prefer to be allowed a little more time to
prepare what I have to say. I had understood that it was desirable to have the motion
adopted in time to be sent to England early
next week.
If the honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) would care
to speak now, I will gladly give way, for
the reasons stated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have asked the house to
permit me to adjourn the debate, and it is
up to the house to grant or refuse my request.
So as to place myself quite in order, I now
move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that the
debate be adjourned.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Honourable senators, I
regret very much to have to say that I cannot
fully co-operate with my friend in his motion.
The senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
was right in saying that it is desired to have
the resolution sent to England next week. I
find myself sitting between two stools, as it
were. My leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who
is unavoidably absent, told me he was anxious
to have the resolution put through today. It
has been widely discussed in the other house
and in the press, and we should like to have
the Senate's debate concluded this week, if
at all possible. In the circumstances, unless
some other senator is ready to proceed, I
unfortunately have to oppose my honourable
friend's motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot help that.

SENATE
The Hon. Ihe Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Haig, seconded by the Honourable Senator Aseltine, that the debate be
adjourned. Is it your pleasure to concur in
the motion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Copp: The motion is lost.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, I will ask for
a division of the house.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Honourable senators,
I should like to be clear on one pointwhether or not any other senator is prepared
to speak this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I offered to make way for
anyone who wished to speak.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Judging from remarks
that were made, I should gather that one or
two other senators are ready to procced.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If anyone wishes to speak
this afternoon, I will withdraw my motion,
provided the house gives me the right to
adjourn the debate later. I say to the acting
leader (Hon. Mr. Copp) that be can refuse me
the adjournment, if he wishes, but there are

always two sides to everything.
number of measures remain to be dealt with
this session, and I say quite candidly that
if this adjournment is refused me I will
exercise my rights to see that the rules are
strictly enforced from now until prorogation.
The only way I could be beaten on that
would be by amending the rules. I have
co-operated as well as I could during the last
six sessions, and have never asked for any
favour until now. I would not have requested
this one, but for the fact that I have been very
busy on committee wvork-dealing with the
Bankruptcy Bill among other things. Because
of carrying a heavy load I have not had
enough time to prepare the remarks that I
should like to make on the resolution. If the
house will allow me to adjourn the debate, we
should still have plenty of time to carry the
resolution by Wednesday of next week, which
will be early enough.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Will the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) withdraw his
motion? The senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) wishes to speak.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will withdraw my motion
and move it again later.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
now that this little storm has vanished into
thin air, I rise to make a few observations
on the very important resolution that is
before the house. Probably no event in our
whole history has carried deeper significance
for this young nation than the Act we shall

be performing in passing this Address. Let
no one for a moment imagine that I am
opposed to the motion. If I had any criticism,
it would be that of the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), as stated
in his excellent address yesterday, that the
action we are about to take might well have
been taken at a considerably earlier period.
At this time I trust it may be interesting
to my colleagues to traverse a little history.
The first successful effort to achieve responsible government in what is now Canada was
made more than one hundred years ago, in
the province of Nova Scotia. Anyone who is
interested in the historical evolution through
which we have reached the point where we
are today could well read the speech that
Joseph Howe delivered in his own defence,
when he was charged by the public authorities with advocating dangerous doctrines in
his newspaper.
Hon. Mr. David: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: His acquittal set responsible government on its way in Nova Scotia.
There were other notable evolutionary steps,
but I shall not refer to any of them in detail.
One was the Rebellion of 1837. Now, while
that contest had different aspects, it was
essentially a contest to enlarge the freedom
of self government in what was then known
as Upper and Lower Canada.
Hon. Mr. David: No doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Another very interesting
event occurred in 1859, when Sir Alexander
Galt was Finance Minister of what was then
Canada. As honourable senators know, after
the negotiations subsequent to the Rebellion
of 1837 the provinces of Ontario and Quebec
were united into the province of Canada. The
historical record indicates pretty clearly that
the British government of that day was very
reluctant to surrender certain rights or
privileges to the then Canadian Government,
of which, by the way, Sir John A. Macdonald
was Prime Minister. This contest, which was
over the right of the Canadian Government
to levy customs tariffs, took a peculiar form.
Following the establishment of free trade
in Great Britain, the government of that
country sought to impose upon Canada the
condition that she must not impede imports
to or exports from Canada. Struggling young
Canada, on the other hand, needed revenues
to carry on the business of a rapidly developing country. As a confirmed believer in the
abolition of tariffs, I must confess to a
measure of sympathy with the views then
expressed by the government of the United
Kingdom. However, it was on this issue that
the Canadian Government finally established
the right to govern its own affairs in the
matter of fiscal policy and trade. If anyone

NOVEMBER 3, 1949
is interested in pursuing the subject further,
in a book entitled The Life of Sir Alexander
Galt, by the late O. D. Skelton, he will find
at page 330, a letter which was the basis for
establishing that right, following which interference in these matters by Great Britain
ceased.
We now come to confederation, which
formed the basis of Canada as we have it
today. When we consider the conditions
which existed in this country at that time,
it becomes obvious that confederation was
a tremendous achievement. Behind the desire
for confederation of the Canadian provinces
were two impelling forces. First, the United
States had just fought a civil war in which,
curiously enough, the primary issue was not,
as most people think, the abolition of slavery,
but the question of state rights. During this
conflict much anti-British feeling developed
in the northern states of the American union;
the sense of possible danger, and the need
to provide against it, so far as that could
be accomplished, was one impelling force
behind the desire for confederation. The
second impelling force was the difference
which arose in Canada between Quebec and
Ontario. The population of Ontario was
increasing rapidly, and the public men from
that part of Canada wanted a stronger representation in parliament as it then existed.
Confederation was achieved, and I repeat
that it was a remarkable accomplishment.
We come later in history to Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who, I think, made a notable contribution to Canada's advance towards nationhood. Those whose memories go back fifty
years will recall a very definite movement in
Britain-not by the government, but by people
outside the government, known as "the Round
Table Group"- with a view to establishing a
common voice in international affairs so far
as Great Britain and the dominions were
concerned. I think Sir Wilfrid exercised
sound judgment at that time in refusing to
be taken in by that camp. He made a great
contribution towards advancing the unity of
Canada by giving Canadians from the Atlantic
to the Pacific a pride in their country. As
honourable senators know, he preached the
gospel that the racial and religious conflicts,
in the past, as in the future, should not
submerge the great advance that could be
made to Canadian nationhood.
Sir Robert Borden also made some notable
contributions to the growth of Canadian
nationhood, the most outstanding of which
was his insistence that Canada be represented in her own right at the signing of
the Peace Treaty of Versailles. The events
of that day are now more than thirty years
past, but I well recall the night when the
decision was reached-and my honourable

friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) will
also remember it-that if Canada was not
to be represented in her own right by her
own delegates, free from any others, she
would not be represented at all.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is not going beyond
the facts of history to say that at that time
the British government put forth the suggestion that Canada should be represented in
the delegation of Great Britain. Sir Robert's
insistence on independent representation at
the signing of the peace treaty marked a
long step in the advance of Canada towards
the status of nationhood.
We come next to the conference of 1926,
referred to by my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), and which I
need not labour. That conference established
a basis, later incorporated in the Act of
Westminster, which to all intents and purposes gave this country practically complete
independence.
An event which took place prior to 1926,
and which perhaps should be referred to,
was the negotiation in 1923 under the King
administration of that day, of the Halibut
Treaty between Canada and the United States.
That was the first treaty negotiated by
Canada which her representatives signed, and
signed alone, as plenipotentiaries from the
Canadian government.
I mention these matters, honourable senators, because I think it is well to keep them
in our minds. It is well that we look back
with pride to the great work of the Fathers
of Confederation, and to the creation of a
It is our serious
Canadian constitution.
responsibility to carry forward that conception in the best and most effective way
possible.
When I first entered public life over thirty
years ago, a gentleman for whom I had very
high respect and who had been eminent both
in public life and on the bench, presented
me with a copy of the British North America
Act and amendments up to that time. I
recall very well the statement he made to
me at the time: that this was a document
which should be studied by every man in
public life, because there could be no greater
danger to the unity of Canada than a conflict between the federal authorities and the
provinces. I was very much influenced by
that statement.
I do not hold with the compact theory of
confederation. The answer to that theory
was very forcefully and effectively presented
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
and the honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). That theory is an

SENATE
impossible one. Some may call confederation
a pact; some may say it is an agreement.
I would liken it to marriage, which is
intended to be permanent and enduring. At
the same time I hold the view that we must
be careful not to weaken the authority of
the provinces. After all, they have very
grave responsibilities. Theirs is the obligation to look after the matters of education
and of property and civil rights; it is their
duty to administer justice within their
respective areas. These are great tasks in
any nation. The Fathers of Confederation
were wise when they decided upon a federal
jurisdiction rather than the centralization of
all legislative powers in Ottawa. By no other
means could they have resolved the conflicts
which then existed and which it was sought,
through confederation, to cure. Another
reason why complete centralization would not
have been wise is that this is a country of
vast extent. You cannot govern from Ottawa,
in local matters, people who are thousands
of miles away, whether in British Columbia,
Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. The provinces have distinct responsibilities in a federal
system, and I think it would be a great
mistake to try in any way to weaken their
powers within their own jurisdiction.
I do not share the fears which some have
expressed that the proposed legislation will
open the way to a weakening of provincial
responsibilities. But it is incumbent upon
parliament to exercise its powers with great
prudence,-for instance, in the matter of
declaring works to be for the "general advantage of Canada." A few years ago, in a
measure then before us, grist mills in the
provinces of the West were defined as "works
for the general advantage of Canada." If
parliament can do that, is it not open to the
federal authority to make the same declaration with regard to oil filling stations, and
might it not be possible in that way to limit
or lessen the authority and power of the
provinces in matters over which the constitution gives them exclusive jurisdiction?
I
mention that point in passing, not because it
has any particular relation to the motion
before us, but to emphasize my opinion that
a heavy responsibility rests upon the federal
parliament not to limit by any means, direct
or indirect, the powers of the provinces.
It would be most unfortunate were any
conflict to arise or intensify between the two
authorities. In matters of this kind our public men must be patriots before they are
The public man, whether in

federal or provincial life, who approaches
these problems otherwise than with a desire
to do what is best for our country is unworthy
to wear the mantle of the Fathers who, in
spite of great difficulties in their day, laid

wisely and well a constitution under which
Canada within eighty-two years has marched
forward to a place among the leading nations
of the world.
I have confidence that our public men will

approach these vital matters-which will profoundly affect the well-being of Canadians
yet unborn-in a spirit of partisanship and
with a disposition to seek political advantage,
whether here or anywhere else, we shall fall
far short of what the occasion requires.
And we have reason for pride. Thinking of
what Canada was eighty-two years ago and
what it is today, I venture the assertion that no
country in the world has shown, at any time
in its history, comparable progress in a similar
period of time. When confederation was
achieved, what we now know as Canada was
a series of scattered disconnected provinces.
It took weeks to get their representatives
together to discuss confederation. The population, as I recall it, was somewhere around
three millions. Those were the days of the
pioneers. What is the picture today? In the
intervening eighty-two years we have opened
up this vast dominion, increased our population to thirteen and a half millions, and
developed our institutions of self-government
through the federal, provincial and municipal
fields. We have advanced education; we have
universities and high schools all over the land.
We have libraries and museums of art which,
if not as far advanced as they might be,

represent a definite beginning. Our material
development has progressed to the point
where we are the third greatest trading
nation in the whole world. Is not this a
record to evoke pride in every Canadian who
has within him any instinct of patriotism?
It is a tremendous achievement!
Looking to the future, I maintain that if we
are true to our traditions, and if on vital
matters of this kind we put our country's
welfare before everything else, this nation
will endure. The record of our past proclaims
our future. We shall build on this northern
half of the North American continent a nation
dedicated to freedom and liberty, wherein
justice and fairness will reign, and where our
progress in these things will be an example
and an inspiration to other nations, in a
weary and distracted world.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I move the adjournment
of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Honourable senators, before
the motion carries, I feel that I should say a
word or two. I am sorry that the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has been
obliged to postpone his speech. If the house

NOVEMBER 3, 1949
had desired to sit tomorrow and my honourable friend had wished to proceed then, we
certainly would have enjoyed listening to
him, and I am sure we could have made good
use of the day. I regret that he thought it
necessary ta make certain dire threats in
order to secure an adjournment of the debate.
Those threats make me tremble, and in the
circumstances I am agreeable to a further
adjournment o! the debate.
Some Han. Senatars: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the acting leader
(Hon. Mr. Copp) should thank the honourable
senator fromn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
who so capably filled the breach.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Marcotte was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
PENSION FUND SOCIETIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. Copp (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
moved the second reading o! Bill V-4, an
Act ta amend the Pension Fund Societies Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I understand that the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
has asked the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to explain
this bill.

At that time I enumerated thirteen important
corporations who had taken advantage of the
machinery provided.
The bill which is now before the house, and
which honourable senators passed last February, extends the benefits of the pension
fund society of any corporation to the employees of the subsidiaries of that corporation.
The bill was prompted by the desire of the
Imperial Tobacco Company, which has had
a pension fund society for many years, to
include ail its employees in one society-and
if the bull were passed, any other corporation
under similar circumstances would enjoy the
same rights and powers. The Imperial
Tobacco Company is a large corporation, having 8,000 employees, fifty per cent of whom
are with the company's six subsidiaries. The
company now wishes ta extend pension fund
privileges to the employees of its subsidiaries.
Hitherto, in order to do that, it would have
been necessary ta 'have seven separate
societies, seven annual meetings, seven minute
books, and s0 on. Worse than that, there
would have had to be seven boards of directors. It is therefore desirable that the one
society should act for the main company and
the subsidiaries, to which I can see no
objection.
As this existing legisiation is highly in the
public interest, has stood the test of time and
has neyer been abused, and as the amendment
proposed by this bill is in keeping with the
modern trend and the government's policy of
extending highly humanitarian pension provisions to employees and their widows and
children, I have no doubt that honourable
senators will pass it without delay so that it
will not again die on the Order Paper of
another place.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has any change been
made to the bill as passed last year?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have checked the bull
and can report that no substantial change
has been made.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Is there any need of sending the bill to committee?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If no change has been
made in the bill, I do not see any need of
referring it to committee.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I must apologize for speaking twice
in the same afternoon. The bill before the
house is an urgent measure, which was
passed in exactly the same form last year,
but which died on the Order Paper of another
place. As I gave a full explanation of the bill
in February of 1949, I assume that I may
limit my remarks at this time. If any details
are desired, honourable senators will find
them at page 53 of the Debates of the Senate,
1949.
The Pension Fund Societies Act, which has
been in force some sixty-two years, was first
enacted by 50-51 Victoria, Chapter 31, and
assented ta on June 23, 1887. It is now to be
f ound in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,
Chapter 155. This legisiation provides a simple
procedure whereby the superior officers o! a

ATOMIC ENERGY COMMITTEE
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I should like to direct a question to the
honourable leader of the government.
Has the government given any consideration to the appointment of senators to the
Atomic Energy Committee? If not, why not?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) did
me the courtesy of advising me that he
intended to ask this question tonight, and I
am happy to answer him at once. When
notice of the motion to appoint a Committee
on Atomic Energy was given in the other
place, I discussed with the government the
possibility of establishing a joint committee. It was suggested to me that, everything
being taken into consideration, it would be
desirable to let a committee of the other
house carry on for this session. It was stated
that the Senate, if it saw fit to do so, could
appoint an Atomic Energy Committee of its
own, and that the government would be quite
willing to create a joint committee next year.
I have been assured that should we appoint
a committee of our own, all the evidence
gathered by the committee of the other place
would be made available to us. I have spoken
to several honourable senators about the
appointment of a Senate committee this
session, and they have differed as to whether
or not it would be advisable. Therefore, while
I am willing that a committee be appointed,
I myself feel that because of the pressure
of other business it might be unwise.

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill V-4, an Act to amend the Pension
Fund Societies Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson (Leader of
the Government) withdrew from the Senate
to return accompanied by Honourable Brooke
Claxton, Minister of National Defence, whom
he escorted to a seat in the chamber.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I think it is proper and fitting that I should
tender an official welcome to the Honourable
Mr. Claxton, Minister of National Defence,
and thank him for coming to this chamber
to explain this bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Brooke Claxton (Minister of National
Defence): Honourable senators, I must say
that I deeply appreciate the privilege of
appearing before this honourable house to
discuss with you this important measure.
I realize that I am the second minister to
appear before you to explain legislation. My
colleague, Mr. Chevrier, appeared here on
the 16th of March, 1948, in consequence of
the change made in your rules the year
before, and since then he has appeared on
another occasion. I hope that, if it is necessary, you will permit me to appear again
before you.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Claxton: The Speech from the
Throne at the opening of parliament in 1948,
and again this year, announced legislation
to deal comprehensively with the armed
forces. The bill now before you gives effect
to these announcements, and will be another
step in the unification and co-ordination of
all the defence forces of Canada. In this
work of unification and co-ordination Canada
is taking a leading place.
The bill is a large one, perhaps the bulkiest
to be put before you since the session of
1934. I hope, however, that any misgivings
you may have on account of its size will be
overcome by the fact that here we are not
only streamlining the legislation relative to

SENATE
the armed forces but are reducing the number of Canadian statutes, for the 251 clauses
in the bill are intended to replace 598 sections in existing legislation.
It might be useful for me to trace briefly
the development of the legislation dealing
with the Canadian forces. The first Militia
Act of Canada was passed in 1868, the year
after confederation, as Chapter 40 of the
Statutes of that year. The Act has been
revised on a number of occasions, but there
has been very little substantial change. The
present Militia Act is Chapter 132 of the
Revised Statutes of 1927. The antiquity of
the measure may be appreciated when I
recall that, until the passing of an amendment that I introduced in 1947, the Militia
Act referred to pack animals but made no
mention of aircraft.
The first Naval Service Act was passed in
1910, as Chapter 43 of the Statutes of that
year. It remained in substantially the same
form in which it was passed until 1944, when
by Chapter 23 of the Statutes of that year
a completely new Act was passed. That
statute introduced the Canadian Naval Disciplinary Code. This was the first Canadian
code to deal with one of the three armed
services, and it has been used as the basis
for drafting portions of the present bill. So
it will be seen that in this respect the Canadianization of our armed forces started with
the Navy.
The first legislation dealing specifically
with the Air Force was the Air Board Act of
1919, Chapter 11 of the statutes of that year.
In the 1927 revision of the statutes the title
of that Act was changed to "The Aeronautics
Act."
Under the three statutes mentioned, each
of the Canadian forces was administered
separately. The Department of Militia and
Defence dealt with the Army, the Department
of Naval Service with the Navy, and the
Air Board with the Air Force. In 1922 the
Department of National Defence Act was
passed, creating a new department to deal
with the three armed forces. This Act was
Chapter 34 of the statutes of 1922, and came
into force by proclamation on January 1,
1923. It represented the first step towards
unified administration of the forces under
one minister of the Crown.
The Department of National Defence Act
had been amended on four different occasions. The principal amendment, made in
1940, provided for the appointment of additional ministers of National Defence.
The experience gained during the last war
showed even more strongly than before the
need for more unified control and greater
uniformity. Moreover, in the case of the
Army and the Air Force there was no
Canadian disciplinary code similar to that

applying to the Navy, passed by parliament
in 1944. The discipline of the Army and
the Air Force was regulated by the Army
Act and the Air Force Act of the United
Kingdom, which were made applicable by
section 69 of the Militia Act and section 11
of the Royal Canadian Air Force Act. The
position and status of Canada make it desirable that there should be a Canadian disciplinary code, enacted by the Parliament
of Canada, and that in the interests of unity
it should be a single code, applicable to all
the Canadian armed services. Accordingly,
soon after becoming minister, I directed that
work be commenced on the preparation of a
single, all-embracing Canadian statute.
The bill now before you represents more
than two years' study by officers of the
Department of National Defence, the Navy,
the Army and the Air Force, as well as by
the Departments of Justice and Finance.
The governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States have also had
under consideration a number of matters
relating to the administration of service
justice, with a view to bringing them more
into line with present-day conditions, and
affording to members of the forces who have
been punished through disciplinary action,
lacilities for having their cases appealed or
reviewed on principles similar to those
prevailing under the Criminal Law.
In the United Kingdom a committee headed
by the Honourable Mr. Justice Lewis studied
the administration of service justice, particularly regarding appeals from courts
martial. Some of the provisions of the present
bill are along the lines of the recommendations made in the report of that committee,
but other recommendations do not now
appear to be applicable to Canadian circumstances. In the United States the Honourable James Forrestal,, then Secretary of
Defence-whose untimely death we all so
much regret-established a committee to
examine into and report upon the administration of service justice in the United States
forces. Based upon the committee's report,
comprehensive legislation was introduced in
Congress this year.
These developments coincided with the
study we were making here of much the
same subjects. Accordingly, full advantage
was taken to obtain all information possible
from the United Kingdom and United States
authorities regarding the measures they have
introduced or intend to introduce. Last
autumn, at my direction, the Judge Advocate-General, Brigadier R. J. Orde, C.B.E.,
proceeded to England and to the United
States to supplement this information by personal inquiry on a number of important
points.

NOVEMBER 8. 1949
The drafting of so entirely new and comprehensive a bill as this was an intricate and
formidable task. It was undertaken by a team
of service legal officers under the direct
supervision of the Judge Advocate-General.
This drafting team was assisted by a senior
officer of each of the services who was in a
position to advise authoritatively on the various service considerations which were continually arising. To all these officers and
officials I express my unqualified thanks for
the work they have done over the past two
years.
I would point out that this undertaking
represents a major development of the utmost
complexity. After all, the work of the armed
forces is work for our security. At the present
time it involves altogether some 90,000 people
in the armed forces, and in a state of war-as
during the second world war-it involves the
relationships of each member of those forces
to his commanding officer, to the country and
to the Crown, to a total number of about
1,200,000 individuals. The men and women
in the services have all the kinds of human
relationships that we as individual citizens
have to one another, and they have added
to them the particular relationship which
comes from the fact that, in war or in peace,
they are working full time for our security.
So, in the drafting of this legislation, our
knowledge gained in the first and second
world wars of the kind of relationships which
should exist between the members of the
armed forces and the state, led us to believe
that those associations could and should be
improved, and that we should do something
towards this all-important objective.
We must recognize that in our peacetime
forces, living in camps across Canada, in communities which are isolated and far off, we
have men who are doing an essential job for
us, and that the conditions in which they are
serving have changed out of all recognition
from anything which was envisaged in 1868.
Consequently we feel that the bill before you
is not only important and desirable, but that
it is essential in order to provide for the kind
of relationship between the officers and men
of the armed forces, the state, and the civilian
population which the people of Canada want,
and which in some small degree is a recognition of the experience and record of the
Canadians who in two world wars helped to
preserve the freedom of our country and
restore peace to the world. It is true, I am
sure, that this bill represents the sort of
changes which most of our officers and men
would wish to see brought about. In our
presentation and in your consideration of this
bill it should be borne in mind, I think, that
the men of our armed forces possess not only
the elements of good citizenship-this is

expected of them-but the qualities of the
good soldier who serves his country all the
time.
So we put this bill before you, not as a mere
technical measure to improve a number of
things which are out of date, not as something merely designed to reduce to more
measurable and manageable contents, the
very complicated provisions with which the
law relative to our armed forces had become
encrusted, but as a recognition that the work
of Canada's armed forces is in the interest of
all Canada all the time, and as such is deserving of the attention of its legislators and of
all its people.
As I have said, in the preparation of this
bill we had the advantage of the experiences
of two wars and the assistance of a number
of officers-some being lawyers, some notwho worked on it for two years. I do not
know how long it is since a bill of this size
has come before your honourable membership, but a glance over the statutes would
indicate that it is some fifteen years. We
have presented the bill to you upon the
instructions of the government, feeling that
it contains the result of the experience and
knowledge of civilians engaged in law as well
as of men who have had experience in the
services; and we believe that you can help
to make this as fine a piece of legislation in
respect of the armed forces as has been introduced in this or any other country.
Drafts of the bill have not only been continuously under consideration by officers of
the department and the services, but they
have been examined by officials of the
Departments of Justice and Finance. Many
major points arose to which consideration
was given by the Chiefs of Staff and Personnel Members Committee representing the
three services. Moreover, the bill was under
constant examination and consideration by
myself and Mr. C. M. Drury, C.B.E.,-a
former Brigadier-General in the service of
Canada's armed forces, and now Deputy
Minister of National Defence-as well as by
the parliamentary assistants-the present
Solicitor General, and the former member for
Shelburne-Yarmouth-Clare, Mr. Loran E.
Baker, who served with distinction overseas
and won the Military Cross. The extensive
services and distinguished records of these
three in the second world war were of
the utmost value in the preparation of the bill.
In the Great War of 1914-19 I had some
experience with this subject of military law.
In the second World War I instructed officers
and officer candidates in military law, and to
help in this I prepared a booklet entitled
"Military Law and Discipline for Canadian
Soldiers". I have only been able to find one
copy; otherwise I would circulate it among

SENATE
honourable senators to indicate how far we
have progressed. In my several capacities I
have seen something of the way in which
military law works, and because of my own
experience I wanted to see it improved.
Honourable senators will therefore appreciate that my concern with this subject is not
merely incidental to my office. At every stage
I felt it necessary to take a personal interest,
and in addition to dealing with numerous
points almost day to day, I worked completely
through the drafts with the legal and service
experts at four different stages.
When the whole matter has been thoroughly
explored and examined, the bill was considered by a special subcommittee of the
Cabinet, consisting of the government leader
in the Senate, the Minister of Justice, the
Solicitor General and myself. On several
occasions the bill was considered by the
Cabinet.
The result of this work is now before this
house in the form of the eleventh complete
draft. Despite the effort that has gone into
its preparation, I do not wish to convey the
impression that we consider the bill to be
perfect. The government is open to any suggestions which you may make for improvement, and I assure you that such suggestions
would be warmly welcomed. We desire to
get the best possible bill, and so we invite the
co-operation of every member in this honourable bouse, as well as of those in the other
place.
This bill is not just a consolidation of existing legislation; on the contrary, it is a new
piece of legislation, the main objects of which
may be summarized as follows:
1. To include in one statute all legislation
relating to the Department of National
Defence and the Canadian forces.
2. To have a single code of service discipline
so that sailors, soldiers and airmen will be
subject to the same law.
3. To make all legislation applicable to
service personnel, Canadian legislation.
4. To obtain uniformity in the administration of service justice.
5. To provide more efficient and expeditious
means for the transaction of routine business.
6. To provide a right of appeal from the
findings and sentences of courts-martial.
7. To establish the position and functions
of the Chiefs of Staff.
8. To abolish as obsolete, provisions for
levee en masse and enrolment by ballot.
9. To abolish field general courts-martial.
10. To provide for a new trial on the discovery of new evidence.
11. To authorize using active forces to meet
a national disaster, such as a flood, and to
permit the use of reserve forces for these
purposes.

In this connection I only have to recall to
honourable senators from every part of
Canada, the manner in which the armed
forces came to the assistance of the people of
the Fraser Valley in British Columbia a year
ago.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Claxton: Under the existing
defence legislation those operations were
carried out under provisions which, to say
the least, were obscure. Yet we felt it was
in the interest of Canadians as a whole, as
well as the people of British Columbia and
the Fraser Valley, that this assistance should
have been given; and so from the armed
forces there was the most magnificent demonstration of co-operation. This summer my
own province of Quebec had forest fires, and
while they did not approach the dimensions
of a national disaster, they nevertheless
threatened the lives and homes of hundreds
of people. Once again we turned out the
active forces, and we also got the willing support of the reserve forces. I am of the opinion
that these two experiences have demonstrated
that there is a gap, that there should be some
provision whereby the men and officers of
our armed forces could be used to meet
national emergencies other than war. We
think that such provision should apply under
certain circumstances to either the active or
reserve forces, so as to justify the use of the
active force and the payment of the reserve
force.
Honourable senators, I should mention in
particular the code of service discipline which
is part of the bill. Those of you who have
had army experience will recall that you were
regulated by sections 4 to 44 of the Army
Act of Great Britain, which was incorporated
by reference into the law of Canada. When
I served in 1917-19 I did not think that this
was the proper way to deal with Canadiansand I have not changed my opinion since. We
should have a Canadian statute dealing with
Canadian soldiers and airmen, just as we
have for Canadian sailors. What is more, the
same statute should deal with all three forces,
so that a boy who is enlisted in the Navy from
a Montreal home, and happens to run counter
to military rules, will only be exposed to the
same kind of punishment and treatment, and
will have the same possibilities of appeal as
a boy in the Air Force or the Army, who
enlisted from the same house, as has often
been the case. We must have equal treatment for all Canadians serving in our armed
forces; and it must be Canadian treatment,
imposed by Canadian courts which are
authorized by and working under the authority of the Canadian Parliament.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

NOVEMBER 8, 1949
Hon. Mr. Claxion: In proposing all this,
of course, I do not intend to reflect in any
way whatsoever on anything that may have
existed before, because it was by our own
choice that it existed. But the time has
come when we can make our own choice that
it shall not exist any longer. Nevertheless,
I should like to express my gratitude and,
I am sure, that of my predecessors in office,
to those in Britain who co-operated in making
the system work as well as it did and who
allowed us to use their laws. Now, let us
make our laws apply to our own people by
our own decision.
The bill is divided into thirteen parts.
Those parts dealing with the administration
of service justice cannot be made operative
until the necessary rules of procedure and
practice have been drafted and passed, and
this cannot be done until the bill has been
enacted.
For example, honourable senators, provision is made in the bill for dealing with a
number of offences. We start with treason
and work down to absence without leave.
We have to have courts to deal with cases,
and machinery for the taking of evidence.
That has been done by rules of procedure
set up by regulations. In this bill we provide
the authority for new rules of procedure and
new regulations, but until this bill is passed
we cannot have the new rules of procedure
and the new regulations. Still, from the
service point of view, we cannot abandon
the existing procedure and regulations until
we have something to take their place. So
we suggest, honourable senators, that you
provide that parts of the bill be brought
into effect by proclamation. Just as soon as
we can, we shall draft the rules of procedure
and the regulations, making only such changes
as are necessary to bring them into line with
this bill; and when that is done we shall be
ready to start the new procedure going in
accordance with the provisions of the bill,
if it is passed.
It is necessary, I believe, that provision
be made for bringing each of the parts of
the bill into operation by proclamation. Some
of them should be brought into effect at
once, and some only after the necessary rules
of procedure and regulations have been
drafted.
The bill falls into three main divisions.
Parts I, II and III relate generally to organization for defence. They deal with the
creation of the department, and the constitutional set-up. They do not have to do with
the individual officer and man serving.
In the second division, Parts IV to IX
constitute a complete code of service discipline, including the provisions which are necessary to carry the code into effect.

And the third division, Parts X, XI and XII
contain provisions relating generally to
defence and the defence forces, which provisions do not conventiently fall within the
other parts that I have mentioned.
Now, honourable senators, it obviously is
not for me to suggest the procedure to be
followed in your honourable house. The bill
would appear to be a matter suitable for
detailed study. If you should choose to have
that done, there would be available and at
your service officers of the Department of
National Defence and officers of the armed
forces. In this connection, I am glad to say
that the Solicitor General has agreed to
assume a major part. As Parliamentary
Assistant, he had to do with the preparation
of the bill, and this, together with his experience as a lawyer, his service as a member of
parliament and his own record overseas as
colonel in the famous Chaudiere Regiment,
gives him special qualifications to be of assistance to your honourable house. In addition,
I shall of course also be glad to be at any
time, and in every way possible, at your
service.
Honourable senators, the National Defence
Bill is a further important step in co-ordinating and unifying the work and conditions of
service of the Royal Canadian Navy, the
Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air
Force. It is designed to promote the economy
and efficiency of administration in matters
relating to all the armed forces of our country and the fair and just treatment of officers
and men in the service of our country. As
such, I respectfully commend it to your consideration.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before the honourable
minister leaves the chamber, I should like
to ask a question with regard to section 251,
which is under the heading "Commencement
of Act." I notice from this that sections 1,
248 and 250 come into force when the Act
is assented to; section 211 is to operate retroactively to the 8th December, 1947; section
249 is to operate retroactively to the lst day
of October, 1946, and the other sections come
into force when proclaimed. I should be glad
if the minister would give us a brief explanation of those sections which are retroactive.
Hon. Mr. Claxton: Well, sir, section 211,
which is retroactive, deals with salvage. I
understand that it has to do with a matter
that has been under consideration for quite
some time, and that arrangements have been
worked out between the various interests
concerned. Here we seek statutory authority
to make an arrangement which is considered
to be in the interest of all concerned, and
therefore it is just as if this were included
in a special statute. We think it is desirable
that this be passed at this time.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does this section ratify
sorme things that have already been done?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It does not change anybodys' will, does it?
Hon. Mr. Claxton: No, sir. I do not think
it represents anything that has been done.
On the other hand it is in conformity with
arrangements regarding salvage that have
been worked out by representatives of the
United Kingdom, ourselves and other parties
concerned.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
we are indebted to the Minister of National
Defence (Hon. Mr. Claxton) for coming to us
this evening and outlining the new National
Defence Act, which, once it becomes law,
will apply to all our armed forces. I am sure
no one will disagree with the principle of
the bill which we have under consideration
tonight. It is an effort to bring our defence
laws, so far as they relate to the management
and handling of the armed forces, up to date.
The need for such a measure was clearly
illustrated by the reference the Minister made
to the existing law which will be replaced by
the new legislation. He has given us a substantial outline of the purpose of the bill.
I do not intend to discuss any of the details
of the measure, but only to express my agreement with the principle it contains. I am sure
that this house will take advantage of the
suggestion of the Minister, that be would
welcome a close examination of the bill. After
the careful consideration which it has received
during the past two years, I have no doubt
that we will find it, on the whole, a very
desirable piece of legislation to pass.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
with reference to Part III of the bill, relating
to the Defence Research Board, may I ask
the Minister whether the chairman of that
board is directly responsible to him, or stands
in some subordinate relationship to some
member of the general staff? I ask this question because the Defence Research Board is a
new feature in the national defence organization in this country, and I should think
that one of the particular requirements in
connection with it would be a complete freedom and independence from any of the
factors which sometimes apply to other
branches of the armed forces.
Hon. Mr. Claxton: The chairman of the
Defence Research Board reports directly to
me. He is appointed by the Governor in
Council. One feature in Canada which I
think is unique among all the countries of
which I have knowledge, is that the chairman of this board, far from being subordinate
to anyone except the Minister, is given the

status of a Chief of Staff. He sits as a
member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
Also, for the purpose of securing co-operation and co-ordination, the three chiefs of
staff are members of the Defence Research
In this way we secure complete
Board.
inter-relationship between the defence services and the Defence Research Board. This
is important because the services must be
research-minded, and also unless the board
is closely related to the work of the armed
forces it might become rather academic. In
this field I think we have achieved a closer
relationship than I know of in any other
country.
I should add that in the Defence Research
Board we have not only the three chiefs
of staff, but also representatives of civilian
industry, the universities, and the president
of the National Research Council. From my
experience over the past two and half years
I can assure this honourable house that not
only is there the closest relationship between
the armed forces and the Defence Research
Board-because they are members of the
same team-and between the National Research Council in all its activities and the
Defence Research Board-because they serve
the same government-but that a close relationship is maintained with the universities
and with industry. I think one will find,
on comparing this organization with those
that exist in other countries, that there is a
closer degree of integration and a more
effective responsibility in Canada than elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
Minister a question relating to section 45 of
the bill, which relates to educational institutions?
As I understand it, the Royal
Military College has now become a college
for the three services. What will be the
policy of the department as to the appointment of the Commandant of the college? Will
it alternate amongst the three services?
Hon. Mr. Claxion: Yes, it will alternate
amongst the three services. The present
Commandant of the Royal Military College
at Kingston is Brigadier Agnew, who will
be replaced at the end of his term by a
nominee, subject to my approval, from one
of the other services. Royal Roads is set up
on exactly the same basis as the Royal
Military College, Kingston. There for the
first time an air force officer, Group Captain
Millward, has replaced a naval officer, Captain Rayner, on the rotation system.
Our hope is that our cadets, going through
these two service colleges, living and working
together, having satisfied the same entrance
requirements and doing the same training
during the academic term, will get to know

NOVEMBER 8, 1949
each other on a first-name basis, and will
remain on speaking terms when they become
admirals, air-marshals and generals.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I gave warning the other day to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce that,
because of its excellent services and arduous
work on the Bankruptcy Bill, it would be
entitled to assume a greater task of considering the bill now before us.
As we have no standing committee charged
with the responsibility of national defence
matters, I am confident that the house will
agree that this bill should be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and that there it will receive the
same thorough consideration given previous
legislation.
I therefore move that the bill be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
AMENDMENT
ADDRESS

TO HIS MAJESTY-MOTION

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 3, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, that an humble
Address be presented to His Majesty,
requesting an amendment to the British North
America Act, 1867.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
this matter of amending the constitution has
been under discussion for many, many years.
In 1935 a special committee of the House of
Commons was appointed to study and report
on the best method

the same. Parliament through this resolution
is petitioning for a right which is not at
present existing.
We can oppose the resolution on two
grounds; first, that parliament is not entitled
to such amendment without the consent of
the provinces; second, that the moment is not
propitious for such amendment of our constitution.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who proposed the
present resolution in the place and stead of
the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) made the following
statement:
Hon. Mr. Farris: My leader, who asked me to
move this resolution, knows that I hesitated a long
time before I agreed to do so, because I wanted
to convince myself that the resolution was right.
There are things which a man accused of being a
partisan, as sometimes I am, may be willing to do
for his party; but I cannot conceive of any senator
supporting this resolution if he thinks that as a constitutional proceeding it is unsound. It would take
more than mere party loyalty to induce him to do
that.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: For my part, I pondered this
resolution a long time, until I had satisfied myself
at least, that it was on a sound basis and warranted
our support. I see one or two of my friends are
smiling because they know what I am now saying
has been expressed privately to them. I have
written down what I believe to be the correct view
of this question.
It is not enough to say that there was not a
compact. One cannot ignore the fact that most
important and solemn obligations were undertaken
at the time of confederation. Nor should it be forgotten that there was an obligation on the part of
Canada-of each province-and of the Imperial
Parliament to recognize these obligations and see
that they were not violated. The authority to create
the Canadian constitution of 1867 was vested exclusively in the Parliament at Westminster. Nobody,
I suppose, will dispute that statement.

Now, honourable senators, even though that
appeal has not been made to each of the
senators, especially to those who were not
spoken to privately, I would have opposed

own definition but will prove my interpretation of it with the authorities I am going to
cite.
No one in this chamber will seriously deny
that the legislators who made confederation
possible and an actual fact were able men,
and as constitutional authorities, just as good
as, if not better than, the legislators of today.
No one would dare to say that Sir John A.
Macdonald, Sir Georges Etienne Cartier,
George Brown, Taché, D'Arcy McGee and
the other Fathers of Confederation did not
know what they intended to do after years
of consultations, meetings and discussions of
the problems to be solved; or that they did
not take the only steps to carry their proposals to a proper conclusion and secure the
Imperial Act necessary to embody their
wishes and agreements, namely the British
North America Act. No one in this chamber
or elsewhere will dispute ýthat the British
North America Act was the form of the
contract-which could not be entered into by
parties unable to contract; was the wording
of a treaty-which the parties could not be
members of, unless empowered by the government; was the confirmation of a compromise which could not have any weight unless
confirmed by the proper confirming authority.
No one would dare to argue that the Secretary
of State Adderly in the House of Commons,
and Lord Carnarvon in the House of Lords,
did not know the nature of the statute they
were presenting in their respective chambers.
If these were not facts, then the only
conclusion would be that the Fathers of Confederation, the Secretary of State, and Lord
Carnarvon were just misleading the people
or the petitioners-that is the provinces or
colonies of Canada-and were deceiving them
to surrender their rights under false pretences.
Now let us see and find out the facts
concerning these people.
Sir John A. Macdonald said:
The government desired to say that they presented
the scheme as a whole, and would exert ail the
influence they could bring to bear in the way of
argument to induce the house to adopt the scheme
without alteration, and for the simple reason that
the scheme was one not framed by the Government
of Canada or the Government of Nova Scotia, but
it was in the nature of a treaty settled between
different colonies, each clause of which had been
fully discussed, and which had been agreed to by
a system of mutual compromise.

Sir Georges Etienne Cartier, said on May
17, 1867:
The Canadians, said the English ministers, are
coming to us with a ready-made constitution, which

is the result of a friendly understanding reached
between them, and of a thorough discussion of their
interests and their needs. They are the best judges
of what they need, let us not change the agreement
which they have reached, but let us sanction their
confederation.
Yes, that is the very spirit in which Great Britain
received our request. We needed her sanction and
she gave it without hesitation and without any
desire to interfere in our work.

Hon. J. A. Lesage: Has it not been proven
during the last discussion that some of the
clauses agreed upon by the provinces or the
parties to the British North America Act were
changed by the British Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Certainly, some articles
were changed, but an Act was passed which
was accepted by all the provinces. You
obtained an Act which was agreed upon and
approved by all the provinces.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: It was never accepted
by the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Was not the bill
accepted by those provinces? How is it that
they have become part of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Because they were
created by the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Because the articles of
the agreement were under the form of a bill,
and the bill was accepted by the provinces
which to-day are part of the Confederation,
inasmuch as we now have ten provinces, in-

cluding those you mention.
May I present a few further citations?
First, the Honourable D'Arcy McGee:
We are assembled under the

authority of an

Imperial dispatch to Lord Mulgrave, Governor of
Nova Scotia, and acting under the sanction it
gives. Everything we did was done in form and
with propriety, and the result of our proceedings
is the document that has been submitted to the
Imperial Government, as well as to this house, and
which we speak of here as a treaty. . . . It is
beyond your power or our power to alter it.

And Mr. Alderly:
The house may ask what occasion there can be
for our interfering in a question of this description. It will, however, I think, be manifest, upon
reflection, that, as the arrangement is a matter of
mutual concession on the part of the provinces,
there must be some external authority to give a
sanction to the compact into which they have
entered....
If, again, federation has in this case specially
been a matter of most delicate treaty and compact
between the provinces, if it has been a matter
of mutual concession and compromise, it is clearly
necessary that there should be a third party as
extra to give sanction to the treaty made between
them.

America were, as I have said, consenting parties,
and the measure founded upon them must be
accepted as a treaty of union.

Let us now corne to some authorities in the
years after confederation.
Mr. Antonio Perrault:
This Imperial Act of 1867 was the last phase of
a treaty, of a compact, of a contract entered into
by two races, the French and the English races,
two religious groups, the one Catholie, the other
Protestant, both wishing that this federation should
maintain a perfect equality of treatment between
those two racial and religious groups.
The British North America Act is a law in this
sense that it is made up of texts promulgated by
the Imperial Parliament, but a law that may be
enacted only to confirm an understanding, an agreement of wills between provinces and between two
different racial groups.
This question is no longer discussed since the
judiciary committee of the Privy Council has rendered its judgment in the case of "The Regulation
and Control of Aeronautics in Canada."

Judge J. T. Loranger:
The British North America Act was not, as the
constitutional Acts, that preceded it, a law enacted
out of sovereign authority by England and imposing a constitution upon her colonies; it contains a
mere ratification by the mother country of the pact
entered into by the provinces, ratification which
confirmed its provisions and made it binding by
conferring upon it the authority of an Imperial Act.

Judge P. B. Mignault:
Confederation is only the legalizing of a pact

entered into between four provinces . .. The provinces did exactly the same thing as tradesmen who
form a partnership, they pooled part their wealth,
and kept all the rest for themselves.

Mr. Ollivier:
As we will have occasion to prove later on, the
B.N.A. Act is not a contract; it is a statute of the
British parliament; but as it is based on an agreement, on a compromise, it partakes of that agreement and of that compromise, so that none of the
privileges granted us under this law may be taken
away without violating the moral law, the constitutional law and inasmuch as we are an autonomous
nation, the international law. It would constitute
an action similar to that of Germany tearing up the
treaty which guaranteed Belgium's neutrality.

In 1935, Mr. Edwards, who was then Deputy
Minister of Justice, in appearing before the
Special Committee, made this statement:
In any case where the amendment would affect
some matter of provincial concern, the provinces
were consulted.

A. Well, on that branch, my idea would be that

the Dominion authorities would not seek an amendment of that kind without consulting the provinces
in advance.
Q. At least should not.
A. I think, constitutionally, would not.

The Chairman of that committee said:
Perhaps we will have the memorandum prepared
for the next day. There are two other things I
will call your attention to: one is the view put

forward by Professor Arthur B. Keith, in Responsible Government and the Dominions, page 586, in
which he says:
"It was most expressly recognized in 1907 by
the Imperial governent that the Federal constitution is a compact which cannot be altered, save with
the assent both of the dominion and the provinces."

Lord Sankey, in a Privy Council judgment,
stated:
Inasmuch as the Act embodies a compromise
under which the original provinces agreed to

federate, it is important to keep in mind that the
preservation of the rights of minorities was a condition on which such minorities entered into the
federation,

and the

foundation

upon which the

whole structure was subsequently erected. The
process of interpretation as the years go on ought
not to be allowed to dim or to whittle down the
provisions of the original contract upon which the
federation was founded, nor is it legitimate that any
judicial construction of the provisions of sections
91 and 92 should impose a new and different contract upon the federating bodies.

Now, honourable senators, if this Act is of
the nature of a treaty, compact or compromise, how can it be amended without the
consent of the parties concerned?
I wish to quote some more testimony given
by Mr. Edwards:
Q. It might lend great weight, Mr. Edwards, but
do you think we representatives of all the provinces
in the federal arena are authorized to speak for the
provinces on the question of jurisdiction?
A. Not for the provinces, no.
BY THE CHAIRMAN:
Q. Will the people of the provinces accept, in
respect to matters within the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government, representation by
members of the federal parliament? As I see it,
they are not elected to go to Ottawa to give
expressions to opinions on matters of provincial
jurisdiction?
A. You could not by mere declaration transfer
any power from the provinces to the Dominion.

The question arose that is so much discussed
to-day, as to what was the character and nature
of the federation and the so-called compact there.

Following this there appear these questions

My view about that is that it is not necessary to

and answers:
Q. Do you mean directly or indirectly?
A. In certain cases directly. But my own view
is that a matter which only affects a province because it is one of the provinces of the dominion, is
not a provincial concern.
Q. What I mean by that Is, you have all sorts of
powers under the peace, order, and good government
clause. Under that it would be quite easy to
develop the theory that the constitution should be
amended in regard to matters which the provinces
might consider as infringements upon their powers,

Mr. Cowan, member for Long Lake, Saskatchewan, said, "That is fair".
In February, 1925, the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen said:

The British North America Act, 1867, is usually
referred to as the compact of confederation. This
expression has its sanction in the fact that the
Quebec resolutions, of which the Act is a transcript,
were in the nature of a treaty between the provinces which originated the dominion.
At the time of confederation these provinces had
before them two proposals for union of a widely
different nature. There were those who considered
that the most advantageous arrangement would be
a legislative union under which the law-making
power wouId be centralized in one parliament, following the British precedent up to that time.
There were others who believed that the best
arrangement would be a federal union, with a
federal parliament charged with authority over
matters of a general nature, but preserving to the
provinces legislative control over local objects and
the guardianship of provincial interests.

Undoubtedly, the pact of confederation is a contract and there are rights involved therein not
represented by the Parliament of Canada.

This is in line with Professor Arthur B.
Keith's opinion expressed later, in 1931, that
the House of Commons does not speak for
the provinces.
Some doubt, as we have seen, has been
created as to the power of the federal parliament in obtaining amendments to the constitution by joint resolution of both houses,
in matters of provincial jurisdiction or in
matters of disputed jurisdiction.
On page 17 of the minutes of the committee's proceedings the chairman called
attention to a view put forward by Professor
Keith, in which the latter says:
It was most expressly recognized in 1907 by the
Imperial government that the Federal constitution
is a compact which cannot be aitered save with
the assnt both of the dominion and the provinces.

That was a quotation from Responsible
Government and tic Dominions, page 256.
Now may I quote from a statement by
Dr. Beauchesne:
Yes, there was a compact before confederation.
It was emboied in the Act, and that Act has
created a situation botween all the provinces.

words are carefully repeated in section 2 of the
Manitoba Act, in the preamble of the Order in
Council admitting British Columbia to the Union,
in the preamble of the Order in Council admitting
Prince Edward Island, in section 3 of the Alberta
Act and in section 3 of the Saskatchewan Act.
It follows that the British North America Act,
as it stands today, after having been in force for
many years, may be compared to the charter of a
society in which the dominion and the provinces
are members and none of them should be listened
to by the British Parliament if it tried to alter
that charter without the consent of the others.

Here are some extracts from a letter and
memorandum sent by the Honourable Howard
Ferguson, when Premier of Ontario, to the
then Prime Minister of Canada:
On behalf of this province I desire to protest
most vigorously against any steps being taken by
the Dominion Government, or the Imperial Conference, to deal with the provincial treaty until
the matter has been submitted to the provinces
and they have had ample time to give the subject

Honourable senators of Liberal leanings
will certainly approve of any statement by
the late Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe.
I quote now from speeches made by him on
February 18 and 19, 1925, to be found at
page 297 to 300 and 335 to 337 of the
House of Commîîuîon7s Debates of that year:

Ou"stion
C-i [cderatio n was achieved and the new Parliament
was opencd in 1867. Does ho believe that two years
afterwards, in 1869, for instance, this parliamîent
could have fairly reasonably amended the B.N.A.
Act or have askcd the Imperial Parliament to
amend it without the consent of the four original
provinces? Could he fairly say that that could have
been done two years after the opening of this parliament? If it could not be donc ai that time, could
it be donc twenty-five years afterwards, or even
fifty years afterwards, without the consent of the
contracting parties in the pact of confederation?
I want to convey to the house one or two points
and I desire every one of my colleagues net to
lose sight of this. First, the B.N.A. Act itself is net
only the charter of the Dominion of Canada; it is
just as much the charter of the provinces of Canada.
We derive our powers fron the British North
America Act; so do the provinces. They have no
constitution other than the B.N.A. Act; all their
powers they derive from that Act. Would it then
be fair for us to arrogate to ourselves the right to
change the Act which is just as much the constitution of the provinces as it is our own? Second, my
honourable friend speaks of protection to minorities. That is net the only thing in the B.N.A. Act in
which the provinces are interested.
They have

their powers. Have we a right to amend the constitution without their consent, in the way for
instance, of taking away from them some of the
powers which have been theirs since confederation.

Sir Robert Borden, then leader of the
opposition, speaking in the same debate, used
the following words:

a colourable device, or a pretence. If on the true
view of the legislation it is found that in reality,
in pith and substance, the legislation invades civil
rights within the province or in respect of other
classes of subjects otherwise encroaches upon the
provincial field, the legislation will be invalid. To
hold otherwise would afford the dominion an easy
passage into the provincial domain.

Parliament then took the necessary steps to
secure the consent of the provinces. At the
time of passing the necessary resolution, the
Honourable Senator Dandurand, as leader of
the government in the Senate, stated that the
necessary consent of the provinces had been
given. I would not for a moment suggest that
the honourable leader deceived the Senate;
but months later, at the next session of parliament, when the correspondence between the
Prime Minister of Canada and the provincial
Premiers was tabled, it was seen that even if
such correspondence showed some consentand this could be denied-it was not a legal
and constitutional consent at all.
It has been said that several amendments
Honourable senators, what constitutes conto the British North America Act were made

was a product of representatives from all the provinces as such, and not as representatives to a
Dominion Parliament. The government of this province is of opinion that the Dominion Parliament
shculd not act in the matter of obtaining constitutional changes, without the sanction of the provinces
to its proposais to the Imperial Parliament.

SENATE
Dominion, Provincial Powers Ruled not
Exchangeable.
Halifax, June 12.-The Nova Scotia Supreme
Court in a majority decision today ruled that the
province cannot delegate its constitutional powers
to the dominion and the dominion cannot delegate
its constitutional powers to the province.
In other words, the effect of the ruling is to
confirm the constitutional authority of both dominion and province. For instance, it would be unconstitutional and illegal for the dominion to accept
a delegation of traditionally provincial educational
powers and by the same token the province could
not accept a delegation of traditionally federal
bank control powers.
The division of powers as between dominion and
province also covers the field of taxation and
kindred matters.

The last amendment was on the Redistribution Bill, making null and void the clause of
our constitution which was limiting to sixtyfive the number of seats in the province of
Quebec, and constituting that number the
quotient for seats in the Dominion electoral
districts. The provinces were not consulted
before securing the amendment.
A question was put by the honourable
senator from Kingston, (Hon. Mr. Davies) as
reported at page 190 of the Official Report of
Debates, Tuesday, November 1, 1949, as
follows:
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable

a right to amend their constitutions?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Davies: They have gone that far?
Hon. Mr. Farris: All of them. The only reason
that we have not that power is that in 1931, when
the Statute of Westminster was passed, this dominion was not prepared to agree on any method of

amending its own constitution, and at the request
of this country the power was left where it has

always been. . . . It was our decision that it was
preferable to leave the Act as it was until such
time as Canadians were able to agree among themselves as to how they wanted the constitution
amended, and as to what safeguards and restrictions should be put around it.

I wish to ask the honourable senator and
the other members of the Senate to pay

taken from the brief submitted by Mr. Scott,
Professor of Civil Law in McGill University,
Montreal, when he appeared before the
Special Committee in 1935. It states:
South Africa is a particularly interesting example
to us, I think, bcause that dominion has a racial
problem and a minority problem comparable or
analogous to that in Canada; and yet, after begin-

ning with an imperial statute in 1909 as the basis
of their constitution, which contained special guar-

antees for minorities, special entrenched clauses,
they have now re-enacted that statute as their own

constitutional Act, as a statute of their own parliament, and have thus destroyed the legal basis of
the safeguards for minorities which were found
in the earlier Act.

The South Africans now admit

that the adoption by them, by their own parliament, of their own constitution, puts it into the
category of an ordinary Act of parliament in so
far that in future it could be changed legally by the
procedure of an ordinary Act. But they have
stated in the debates and discussion of that change

that, where minorities are protected, they will continue to respect that protection, relying in future
not on legal protection, but simply on one another.
I hope the authorities I have cited will
support, in your opinion, the view I hold that
this proposed power to amend our constitution cannot and should not be granted without the consent of the provinces.
I have stated that the federal members
were not the proper representatives of the
provinces on matters of provincial rights.
But there is a body which was specially
created to represent the provinces in our
parliament, and it is the Senate. This was,
as I tried to show you on previous occasions,
the main purpose of making the Senate an

not repeat what I have said so often. You
know your responsibilities as well as I do.
Read again what was said by the mover
of this resolution, and which I have quoted.
You have been listening to the address of
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). He hopes that there will not
be abuses of this power if secured. It is a
pious hope and we will pray with him that
his wishes may be realized.
But, honourable senators, already encroachments have been made on provincial rights.
With the increased power, the federal government may go much farther. Remember the
bill passed a couple of years ago, making
the
works. Remember
public

address made by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South on that occasion, when
he said that he hoped that his bill would not

only indications of what can be donc. We
hear much about social security, of requests
to the government to help. Again, if this
government supplies the money for social
purposes, may it not, as a consequence,
encroach on provincial rights, contrary to
the wording of the judgment I have cited?
Before I conclude my remarks I wish to
refer for a moment to a supposition made by
the honourable mover, in reference to the
Senate. I was surprised when I read the
address the following day to find such a
statement, coming from the great lawyer he
is. You know very well that the only channel
to reach the English Parliament is through

honourable senator made, if the House of
Commons would vote for the abolition of
the Senate and the Senate were to refuse
to accept this resolution, there would be no
channel to reach the government at Westminster. There would be nothing before that
government. And if, by an abuse of power,

NOVEMBER 8. 1949
the United Kingdom government were to
pass such an amendment contrary to section
4 of the Statute of Westminster, it would
mean the end of the commonwealth of
dominions. Canada would not stand for such
abusive methods.
No, honourable senators, this Senate is in
no danger if we just carry on our work
according to the best traditions of this body.
We are members of a branch of parliament
created to represent the provinces. Let us
represent the provinces and protect their
rights when they are in danger. It is the
right of the provinces to be consulted on
such an amendment to the constitution as is
embodied in this resolution. Let us see that
they are consulted. After all, a conference
is to be held about two months from this
date. Is this parliament in danger of losing
anything if this resolution is delayed until
after that conference? If there is any doubt
about the power of this government to secure
this amendment without the consent of the
provinces, why not submit the question to
our Supreme Court? The next sitting of the
Supreme Court is fxed for early February
1950 three months hence. Our constitution
has stood for over eighty-two years; would
a delay of a few months create havoc?
May 1 revert to the subject of the Senate
before I close this long address? I have
read suggestions that the Prime Minister
might appoint some Conservatives to the
Senate. I have a suggestion to make. Why
should not an agreement be made that at no
time hereafter will the number of senators
representing the opposition in this chamber
be less than the present total of fifteen. This
would assure to the government of the day
a large majority, and a sufficient opposition,
modest in numbers, though not necessarily
in quality. In the event, which unfortunately
must be faced, of a vacancy in the present
representation of opposition senators, the
leader of the opposition in the Commons
would confer with the then Prime Minister
and name one of his followers to be
appointed to the Senate.
But do not forget, honourable senators,
that at one time after confederation there
were only two Liberal members in the Senate,
and the Senate has survived. The Senate will
continue to be the most important branch
of parliament if, under the protection of our
constitution, whether. or not it is amended,
it will simply play its role in our government.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. P. R. DuTremblay: Honourable senators, the subject that has been discussed by
the honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte) is of great importance to the
whole of Canada as well as to the various
provinces.
45785-17

As honourable senators know, in 1841 there
took place a union of Upper and Lower
Canada, with each province having equal
representation. At that time Lower Canada
had a larger population than Upper Canada.
Later, some difficulty was encountered in
carrying on this form of government, because
the leaders of the government were failing
to obtain a majority. In 1848, it was declared
by Lord Elgin, the Governor, that a government required the support of the majority
in the House, and that was the beginning of
responsible government in Canada. Some
time later Upper and Lower Canada, New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia decided to unite
and become the Dominion of Canada. There
is no doubt that the province of Quebec, where
the French element predominated, knew that
its representatives would be in the minority
in the federal parliament.
However, confederation was put into effect
by the Fathers of Confederation with a view
of enlarging and benefiting Canada. They
tried to formulate a policy that would meet
the desired requirements, and satisfy the
different elements entering confederation.
They held numerous meetings and passed
various resolutions which they thought should
be accepted. The difficulty was to preserve
the rights of the minority at the time. After
the resolutions had reached England they
were changed to some extent, and there was
submitted to the British government a proposition that was considered to be a good one.
There is no doubt that very careful attention
was given to the rights of the minority in
this country, and, as honourable senators are
aware, the conclusion arrived at was that the
best kind of government for this country was
a federal system; that is, a central government and various provincial governments,
each having its own rights and privileges.
At the same time the use of the French
language was preserved in Quebec. There
is no doubt that it was understood by the
Fathers of Confederation that the privileges
of each province would be upheld.
To assure that the minorities would be well
represented in the central government, it
was decided that both French and English
would be the official languages of parliament.
These various suggestions were incorporated
in laws passed by the British Government.
The British Government made no undertaking that the law would never be changed,
and we know that the federal government has
on various occasions requested and obtained
changes in the constitution respecting matters
pertaining to the dominion. The best protection that the provinces have regarding their
privileges is the assurance that they can count

SENATE
on the members of both houses of parliament.
Parliament will see that the understanding
between the provinces at confederation will
be lived up to.
As a country Canada has made certain
progress, but in order to acquire greater freedom we must be the masters of our own
constitution. In other words, we should not
be obliged to go to another country to seek
authority to alter our constitution. Great
Britain has always treated Canada well, but
we desire to be free among the nations of
the world and to have the right to change
our own constitution. The essential characteristic of a nation is freedom to change its
own constitution. As the British Empire and
Commonwealth developed, more and more
freedom was given to each member country.
We have now decided that the time has come
when we should have the power to change
our constitution as we wish, without being
obliged to ask permission of the Imperial
Government. That does not mean that when
we have that power we shall no longer continue our association with the other free
nations of the commonwealth. Nothing of the
kind is intended.
I agree that nothing should be done which
would encroach on the privileges and rights
of the provinces, and I have never heard
anyone suggest that anything of that kind
should be done. What we are trying to do is
to become as independent as possible, within
the commonwealth. As I say, we want to
have the right to change our constitution
without seeking permission from the Imperial
Government in England. The Imperial Government has treated us very well, but still
it is not proper that an independent nation
should have to ask permission of some government other than its own when it desires
to amend its constitution.
It has always been taken for granted by the
federal government in this country, regardless of what party was in power, that our
parliament had the right, without consulting

the provinces, to apply to the Imperial
Government for a change in the constitution
pertaining to the federal jurisdiction. On
one occasion the provinces were consulted,
when the purpose of the desired amendment
was to increase the amount of yearly payments to them. But in general the federal
government has not asked the provinces to
approve amendments to the British North
America Act. Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
George Etienne Cartier, who themselves were
among the very originators of Confederation,
believed that the federal parliament had the
right, without reference to the provinces, to
apply directly to the Imperial Government
for a change in any part of the British North
America Act affecting the federal jurisdiction.
I hope that when Canada is given absolute
right to amend her own constitution nothing
will be donc to encroach upon the rights and
privileges of the provinces. I do not think
that anything of that kind could be done,
because if at any time a province feared that
any of its rights were being taken away, or
threatened, it could apply to the Supreme
Court of Canada for a ruling. There is to be
a conference between the federal government
and the provinces, and I hope that at that
conference some means will be agreed upon
for protecting provincial rights. After all,
whenever a province has considered that its
rights were in danger it has had to apply to
some tribunal for protection of those rights.
Is it not proper that the Supreme Court of
Canada should in future be the tribunal to
which the provinces may apply? It may be
that the coming conference will be able to
work out some procedure, satisfactory to the
provinces, whereby the Supreme Court, as
the final court of appeal, will give them a
greater measure of protection in years to
come than they have had in the past.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
AMENDMENT
ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY-MOTION
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Farris, that an humble Address be presented
to His Majesty, requesting an amendment to
the British North America Act, 1867.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
my first duty is to thank the house for permitting me to postpone my speech from last
Thursday. I was prepared to speak on
Wednesday, but I found myself too tired to
enter into the debate.
I want to congratulate the member from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) upon the
splendid address he made in moving this
resolution. I also offer my congratulations to
the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and the senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) upon their addresses.
Other
speeches have been made in this debate, but
these three affected me most, and that is why
I mention them.
This is a great moment in our history. It
is the first time since confederation that there
has been any attempt to amend he method of
dealing with our constitution. True, through
the years some thirteen or fourteen amendments have been made to the British North
America Act, some of them with the consent
of the provinces and some without; but all of
of these were more or less of an inconsequential nature, and in general they received
almost unanimous approval. I know that
everyone was not in favour of the 1946
amendment, but it largely affected only the
federal parliament. The present proposal, as
I say, is the first real attempt to change the
way of amending our constitution.
I wish first to read a few words from a
radio address made by the Right Honourable
the First Minister (Right Hon. Mr. St.
Laurent). On May 14, 1949, he said this:
We Liberals also believe that a method should
be worked out to amend our constitution in Canada.
That won't be easy.
We do not want the Canadian constitution to be
too rigid, but we do want to make sure it contains
the fullest safeguards of provincial rights, of the
use of the two officiai languages, and of those other
historie rights which are the sacred trust of our
national partnership.
45785-17J

With those words I entirely agree. They
state the issue. But the resolution before us
does not offer a means of solving that issue;
it does not carry out the promise implied in
the words I have just read. In another place
the First Minister was challenged to deny
that we already have the power to amend our
constitution, and he replied we have the
power but that the people of Canada do not
understand that. That was not what he said
in his radio address.
A good many senators and others have
stated that this resolution is a milestone on
the road to Canada's independence from control by another country. The argument is
that we are a great nation and that we should
have the power which is sought through this
resolution, the power to amend our own constitution. Yes, but the problem is how to do
it. In 1931, when the Statute of Westminster
was drafted, the government of that day asked
the Imperial Parliament to consent to the
insertion of a proviso that Canada should not
have the power to amend its own constitution.
That consent was given, and there was no
dispute over that action.
Our constitution is roughly divided into
three parts. The first deals with the rights
and powers of the dominion; the second, with
the rights and powers of the provinces. One
portion of the Act deals partly with dominion
and partly with provincial powers, I am not
referring to that. The third part, which is
very important, deals with education and
language.
I am not one of those who say that the
British North America Act was a compact,
and that it cannot be amended except by getting the consent of the four original provinces. I do not think that position is legally
sound. I do, however, believe that the men
who brought about the British North America
Act understood that its conditions would not
be changed. Had they antici.pated for a
moment that anyone could vary its provisions,
they would not have agreed to the constitution.
One has only to read the history of Upper
and Lower Canada to know the attitude of the
people in those provinces before confederation. I have not looked up the facts in this
respect, but I think there were seven or eight
governments in as many years in the two
provinces. One government could not remain
in power more than three or four months.
This continued until conditions became
impossible. The real beginning of confederation was when such dyed-in-the-wool politicians as Sir John A. Macdonald and the
Honourable George Brown walked across the
floor of

the house

and shook hands, and

agreed to try to improve the situation.

SENATE
Sir Georges Etienne Cartier from Quebec
was just as able as any member of parliament from that province today, and he was
just as keen to protect provincial rights. On
the other side of the boundary, in Ontario,
there were Sir John A. Macdonald, the
Honourable George Brown and A. T. Galt,
who were equally anxious to safeguard their
provincial rights. In the Maritimes, Tupper
and Tilley had the same ambitions.
The statement made by the honourable
leader of the government in this house (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) a few sessions ago in the
debate on, I believe, Dominion Day, impressed
me more than anything I have ever heard on
the attitude of the Maritime provinces
towards confederation. He said he could
remember that in days gone by, his grandfather, on the first of July, would hang the
flag at half mast. With that incident in
mind, no one can make me believe that the
people of that section of the country were
not very keen to have the British North
America Act protect their full rights and
privileges.
Why did those early statesmen who metfirst at Charlottetown and later at Quebecto draw up a constitution to submit to the
British Parliament, decide to make provision,
for a Senate in Canada? Why did they not
just ask for a House of Commons. Some may
answer that it was because Great Britain had
its House of Lords. But I would point out
that there is one provision relating to the
House of Lords which does not apply to the
Senate of Canada, namely-and I would ask
my newspaper friends to note this-that the
constitution of the British House of Lords can
be altered by swamping that house with
members. That could never happen to the
Senate of Canada. The government of this
country today can appoint eight new senators, and that is the limit to which it can go.
It is the contention of some newspapers that
the Senate is not very keen to pass this
resolution requesting an amendment to the
British North America Act because it might
affect the position of this body. That suggestion is just tommy-rot. There is not a man
or woman in this house who, as far as the
position of the Senate is concerned, cares a
rap whether the motion passes or not. I agree
with the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that once we have
the right to amend the British North America
Act it will be harder to change the constitution of the Senate, because we will then control any amendment.
The day may come when there will be a
socialist government in our House of Commons, as there is in Britain today. Should
that happen, does anyone for a moment think
that the British Parliament-having already

amended the constitution of the House of
Lords-would refuse to amend the constitution of the Senate? I may be a hypocrite, but
I think the British Parliament would accept
such a resolution if it came from a socialist
government in Canada. When I read the
speeches of left wing members in England,
who say that they are maintaining Canada by
buying her grain, I am not at all sure what
the British House of Commons would do in
the matter of future amendments to the
Canadian constitution.
Let us see what the issue is. Macdonald
and Brown, in speeches from which I can
quote, if necessary, point out how this chamber was constituted. It consisted of twentyfour members from the Maritime Provinces,
twenty-four from Quebec, and twenty-four
from Ontario; and in 1915, witih the consent
of all provinces, provision was made for
twenty-four members from Western Canada.
Equal allotment was made to each of these
four sections of Canada. Honourable George
Brown was hostile to Quebec. I make that
statement with no disrespect to his memory,
and I do not mean that his hostility was
personal, but it is a fact of history that he
was politically hostile. The people of Quebec
voted against him; the people of Ontario
voted for him. Yet Mr. Brown consented to
this method of protecting provincial rights.
Wherever, as in Britain and New Zealand,
the whole country is under a single government, it is possible to swamp the second
chamber with appointees favourable to the
party in power. The upper chamber represents only property and individual rights.
But in Canada, as Mr. Brown pointed out, the
Senate represents not only property and individual rights and freedoms, but the provinces
as well. If one reads the reports of the
debates, and particularly the statements of
Sir John A. Macdonald himself, one can come
to no other conclusion than that the intention was to give the Senate a limited representation from the Maritime Provinces, from
Quebec and from Ontario, with the object of
protecting the rights of those provinces.
Under the circumstances our duty is plain.
If we believe that the resolution proposed,
whether in itself or by implication, is likely
to menace provincial rights, it is our duty
as senators-a duty much greater than
devolves on members of the popular houseto see that those rights are protected. It is
no answer to this contention to say that members of the other house are elected from
Quebec, or Manitoba, or some other province.
The fact is that they represent the country in
a different way; they represent majorities,
and majorities sometimes act tyrannically:
therefore the Senate was made the protector
of the provinces and provincial rignts.

NOVEMBER 9, 1949
My objection to the amendment proposed
is not based on legal grounds. I do not believe
it is beyond the powers of the Dominion. I
am not one of those who believe that if we
pass a bill on the lines of this resolution, and
parliament is vested with the right of amendment, any powers will be taken away from the
provinces; in my opinion, if such a thing were
attempted, the Supreme Court would prevent
it. I am not trying to paint a one-sided picture; I am willing to admit all that should be
admitted. But this amendment does not go to
the crux of the difficulty. Last evening the
honourable senator from Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. DuTremblay) said that when this change
has been approved we shall be entirely free
from control of our constitution by Great
Britain. That is not my opinion. The rights
which the Fathers of Confederation tried to
protect-namely those in respect of education and the use of the English and French
languages-still remain within the jurisdiction of the British Parliament. We are as
much tied to them as we ever were.
Now, what did the people who drafted
the constitution of the United States find?
They discovered that their greatest problem
was how to amend that constitution. Honourable senators will recall that in 1935, before
a parliamentary committee, Mr. Skelton set
out the four different ways of amending the
American constitution. One way is this. If
two-thirds of the states request a constitutional amendment, a vote of all the states
has to be taken. If three-quarters of the
states voice approval, the amendment will
carry. However, that method of amending
their constitution has never been tried. One
method that has been tried is to have both
the House of Representatives and the Senate
vote, by a two-thirds majority, for a constitutional amendment. When this has been
done, the amendment is then submitted to
the states, who must reply within seven
years, and three-quarters of the states must
approve the amendment in order to make it
effective.
Australia has its own constitution, and
the system of amending it is a little different.
It can only be amended under two provisions.
The first is that there must be a majority in
favour of the amendment in the House of
Representatives. Then the Senate must
approve of the amendment, and finally it is
submitted to the states. Another way is for
the House of Representatives to pass an
amendment, which the Senate may amend or
reject. If the Senate amends it, the House
of Representatives may accept that amendment or refuse to do so. If the Senate rejects
the amendment, a year later the House of
Representatives can pass the same amendment again, after which it is submitted to

the six states of the Union, four of which
must vote for it if it is to become law, and
the majority of the total vote in the whole
of Australia must be for the amendment.
In my opinion the bill before us is just
"eyewash". It will enable some politician
to get up on a backwoods platform and
declare, "We have exerted our right as a
great nation; we can now amend our own
constitution". Well, we may be able to amend
our constitution, but only with respect to
some thing about which nobody gives a rap.
It has been said that the Senate is here as
a protection in certain cases. But can we
resist? I would say to anybody from the
Maritime Provinces or Quebec that a vote in
another place can swamp any action on the
constitution by this house. Let us suppose
that the House of Commons wants to abolish
French as an official language. Let us say
that the proposal is carried in the country,
and a bill to effect this end is passed by the
House of Commons. The Senate could refuse
to pass the bill, but the government could go
to the country again, and if it won, would
be able to resist? I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think so. It has
never happened that an un-elected house has
been able to resist such a thing.
This amendment does not go to the crux of
the matter, which is ability to amend the constitution ourselves. The day we pass such a
legislation, confederation will truly become
a reality. Possibly it would require a twothirds vote of the House of Commons and the
Senate. I may be wrong, but I think the
present government could get that kind of a
vote now. Then it would have to get a
certain vote from the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A popular vote?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no. I did not say that.
The provinces are affected, and there would
have to be some provision for amending our
constitution similar to that in the United
States and Australia. There would have to
be some provision whereby, in addition to
the popular vote, approval by a certain number of the provinces would be necessary.
Two of these provinces would have to be
Ontario and Quebec, because they have more
than 60 per cent of the population of Canada
and are represented in the House of Commons by 155 members as compared to 107
members from the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. Euler: These provinces may not
always have a majority.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish you were right, but
I think they will always have a majority of
Canada's population. British Columbia and
Alberta may some day have many people,

SENATE

but agricultural provinces such as Manitoba
and Saskatchewan will never have large
populations. This is so, not because people
are going elsewhere, but because of the
improvement of farm machinery. For
instance, when I was a boy a gang of fifteen
men worked on one thresher. Today only
three men are required to do the job.
Honourable senators, I do not think any
provincial government would dare to suggest
an amendment to the constitution. I know
I should hate to be a member of a government which did. Canada now has ten
provinces and if the eight smaller provinces
consented to an amendment to the constitution, what would be the situation of Ontario
and Quebec? I do not think that Canadians
would consent to any amendment which
would coerce a province into doing something
that it did not want to do. Each of us has
read what the Fathers of Confederation went
through, and even our discussions here have
taught us how important it is for future
Canadians that, whatever we do with our
constitution, we should not create disunity.
Ve have great unity in Canada now.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has been a growing
unity. I am not going to give credit to any
particular party for this, because I presume
that such men as Macdonald, Laurier and
Borden have all contributed their share. My
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) made a fine reference to this the
other night, and I agree with what he said.
Honourable senators, I am willing to vote
for this resolution, but I do not believe it
really means a thing. Canada is to hold
a dominion-provincial conference in January,
and I think this amendment, if approved, will
do the conference a lot of harm. It has been
suggested that we will not be able to get
Alberta or Quebec to agree. I do not know
about that. I presume that if somebody
from Nova Scotia had been speaking in this
chamber in 1865 he would not have agreed
to all of the Quebec resolutions; and, shortly
afterwards, when an election was held in
Nova Scotia, Sir Charles Tupper was the
only advocate of confederation elected. This
was an indication that the province did not
like what had been done, but it was converted later. I cannot imagine that our
public men of today are any smaller than
were those at the time of confederation, and
I do not believe the provinces would refuse
to meet the federal government in a conference called to consider the whole constitutional problem.
We are a great people, with a great country.
We played an important part in the First
World War and the Second World War, and
our representatives are prominent in the

activities of the United Nations. Our statesmen were the first to suggest an Atlantic pact;
our people were the first to offer help to
other nations in need. As soon as war broke
out in 1914 we became one of the allies fighting Germany, and we did the same thing in
1939. The party in power at the outbreak
of the First World War was not the same
one that was in power when the second war
broke out; but in each instance the action
taken was the same, for Canadians saw
clearly and at once what the issues were. We
have an advantage over the Americans, in
that our friendship and connections with the
British and other European peoples-the
French, particularly-enable us to see earlier
than do our neighbours to the south just what
is involved in conflicts between certain
countries of the old world.
As I say, I do not believe that the government of any province would refuse to participate in a conference if one were called by
the federal government with a view to working out a method whereby the dominion and
provinces might carry on in harmony. I
admit that it would be difficult to work out
a method, but I believe that the problem
should be attacked now. For a good many
years there has been a steady growth in the
spirit of unity among our people, and it seems
to me that that fact alone would go far to
ensure the success of a conference.
Somebody may say to me "Suppose your
province of Manitoba was opposed to an
agreement with the other governments." Well,
if the proposal put forward by the other
governments was reasonable, I know what
would happen to any government in our
province which rejected it. At the very first
opportunity the people would turn the government out of office. I believe the same is true
of every other province. Take Alberta. Some
people suggest that that province would not
be keen on joining in a general agreement
with all the other provinces. Well, owing to
the situation in Alberta, the provincial government there is undoubtedly a strong one,
but I cannot think it would withhold its
consent to a reasonable proposal. Similarly,
if a draft agreement whose terms were clearly
in the interest of the whole country were put
squarely up to the Government of Quebec,
I do not believe that government would
reject it. In the discussions preceding confederation Quebec's representatives came to
an understanding with delegates from the
other parts of the country, and I see no
reason to believe that present representatives
would act in a different spirit.
I am greatly disappointed that the Prime
Minister did not carry out his suggestion of
calling a conference with the provinces, for
I am convinced that this would have been

NOVEMBER 9. 1949
in the best interests of the whole country.
If you split a measure into two or more parts
and get one part passed separately, it becomes
more difficult afterwards to get the remainder
passed. Suppose there is a conference with
the provinces in January, and they cannot
reach an agreement. They may agree upon
legislation to clarify provincial rights, but will
they agree upon how the constitution may
be amended? That is the underlying issue.
The federal government may have no difficulty in securing approval of proposals that
conform to the rights of the provinces as
set out in the British North America Act and
its amendments and in judicial decisions, but
there will be trouble over any proposed
change affecting questions of education and
language, and the representation of the less
populous parts of Canada in this chamber.
I do not think there is any doubt about that,
and I say that the whole subject should have
been discussed before this in an endeavour
to reach a basis of agreement satisfactory
to all parties.
Honourable members, I presume that this
subject will come up for consideration here
as long as most of us live. The Senate has a
greater responsibility to Canada than has any
other legislative chamber. Its members are
appointed for life. Before we come here most
of us have had a good deal of experience in
public affairs and in business or professional
life, and we are already aware that Canada
is an important country in world affairs. We
realize that our people would like Canada to
be recognized among other nations as a free
and independent country, with power to
chart its own course. Canadians do not like
having to admit before the United Nations
or any other international organization that
our country is dependent upon Great Britain.
Of course, we know that it is not, though
in a legal sense Britain still has some control
over our legislation. However, when making
changes in this matter, let us move slowly,
and be careful not to destroy the good will
existing among our people. Let us be very
careful lest we raise an issue that will take
years and years to live down.
My memory goes back quite a long way,
and I am going to make a reference to the
general election of 1926. I am not mentioning this for any political reason. I think the
Conservative party was very foolish in accepting the responsibility of forming a government just before that election. If the then
leader of the Conservative party had declined
the premiership and his predecessor in office
had gone to the country, the people would
have had a chance to express themselves on
certain issues that, as it happened, were
overshadowed. For when the Conservative

leader formed a government and the Governor General granted his request for the dissolution of parliament, the then leader of the
opposition contended that the granting of that
request, in the circumstances, had raised a
consitutional issue. The election turned on
that, and the people of Canada made no mistake in the decision they gave. They showed
that they wanted Canada governed in accordance with the practices established under its
constitution.
Constitutional rights are dormant in this
whole matter now before us. If it were only
a question of dollars and cents we should
have no great trouble in dealing with it.
We could get over any problem caused by
selling our wheat too cheaply, or our butter
at too high a price. But constitutional issues
are more difficult. We are naturally opposed
to anything that threatens to interfere with
our freedom. I am all for the right of
Canada to amend its own constitution. The
problem is how to devise a formula satisfactory to the federal and provincial governments for amending the constitution, and
some formula is necessary in order that we
may be saved the necessity of facing difficulties in future.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
the debates on the Supreme Court Bill and
on this resolution have produced a considerable similarity of argument. In both debates
we have heard a good deal from gentlemen of
the legal profession, but I now make bold to
utter a few remarks, for, after all, as a layman I represent a very large number of
people in Canada. One thing that concerned
me as I listened to the lawyers was that each
of them could have taken the opposite point
of view and made an equally convincing
argument.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The senator from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) gave us an
interesting address, and he was all for change.
I would like to remind him that not all change
is progress, as the last President Roosevelt
once pointed out. On one occasion some
people were urging him to do a certain thing
because it was new and progress. He said it
might be new, but it was not progress. I
enjoyed the very fine address of the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), but I do
not agree with what he said. And I do not
agree with my own leader (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. Copp: We do not blame you.
Hon. Mr. Horner: However, that is not
unusual for me.
I am reminded by the honourable senator
from Churchill of the prayer of the Pharisee;
"I thank God that I am not as other mern".

SENATE

The honourable gentleman talked about our
great country and the progress we have
made. He pointed to the increase in the population, the wealth in the trade of Canada and
so on. I would remind him that during the
past ten years a great deal of our trade has
come about by reason of the fact that a large
part of the world was devastated by war.
Under those circumstances, we have been
able to dispose of large quantities of manufactured goods and food. Had Canada the
right kind ofHon. Mr. Euler: Government?
Hon. Mr. Horner: -the right kind of statesmen, we would have a population of a hundred million today. When we speak of our
progress we should remind ourselves of the
plight of small islands in some parts of the
world where soil has to be carried in baskets
to cover the rocks.
Many years ago the three million people
then in Canada had the finest heritage in the
world. In those days if a person suggested
that the government should keep a man's
father and mother, by means of an old age
pension, lie would have been chased off the
farm; and no one ever expected the government to help him support his children.
What was the heritage of this country?
How have we handled it, or how have we
given it away? Let us not forget the Ashburton Treaty, concerning the area which is
now the State of Maine. Then let us ask
ourselves why Alaska, at the other end of
the country, is not part of Canada. That vast
empire, which extends down almost to Prince
Rupert, should be part of Canada. A member
of the other house recently expressed our
position in these words: "We have done those
things which we ought not to have done, and
we have left undone those things which we
ought to have done".
I ask honourable senators to seriously consider what we have done in the way of building railways in Canada. We built one great
road at high cost, and then proceeded to build
a second paralleling the first.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend?
Was the loss of Alaska or Maine attributable
to the Canadian government?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, it

was, at

least

partly so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No. It was the British
government.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, I maintain it was
partly Canada's fault.
After building two railways paralleling
one another across Canada, we have left
vast areas in the north country without any
rail service at all. I know of one instance
where the Canadian Pacific Railway was

granted a charter to extend its line thirty
miles north to serve a farming community
where the settlers had families of as many
as fourteen children. The right-of-way was
surveyed years ago, but the thirty-mile extension has not yet been built.
The Peace River district, which has one
of the largest coal deposits in the world,
has for years been promised a railway to the
Pacific coast. The old objection is that the
products of that area cannot profitably be
brought to Montreal or Toronto. I say
honourable senators, that cities like Montreal
and Toronto should be created in that district.
Sir John Boyd-Orr, a world authority on
food, claims that the main cause of wars is
the lack of food. Yet our government is
responsible for a sitting-on-the-doorstep
policy of immigration in this country, and
refuses to allow large numbers of people to
come to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not arguing that
point.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But it is the fault of the
government that we have not got cities like
Montreal and Toronto in the vast northern
part of this country. As a layman, I am not
satisfied with the progress Canada has made.
The honourable lady senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) told of how five
noble women from western Canada appealed
from the Supreme Court ruling concerning
the right of women to sit in the Senate. I do
not hesitate to say that western Canada, with
all its immense wealth and resources, is left
without proper parliamentary representation.
The people in the four western provinces
agree to the principle of self-determination,
and if things continue as they are, I would
not be surprised to see those provinces break
away from Canada. The West has no money
to build railways into its northern parts,
where food can be produced in abundance for
the population of Canada; yet this country
sees fit to bring a man from Paris to tear this
city to pieces-to tear down the Union
Station and the Daly building, and spend
enormous sums, for what? I appeal to the
government to go slowly in this project,
because Ottawa may not be the capital of as
large a country as it expects.
In passing I wish to mention the Hudson
Bay Railway, and to remind honourable
senators that the West may have to appeal
for justice in that case.
A former honourable Speaker of this chamber said that honourable senators should
express their own ideas, and not the thoughts
of someone else contained in newspaper
articles. I have taken courage from that suggestion, and am now expressing my own
thoughts and not the policy of any party.

NOVEMBER 9, 1949
If Canada is ever to take her place as a
great nation in the world, she must set about
providing for those who cannot provide for
themselves. The vast north country is an
empire in itself, with large areas of fertile
land, minerals and timber-and for fifty years
there has been the promise of a railway.
Some farmers in that district have to transport their grain 500 miles to the railway at
Edmonton, to be shipped to the market at the
west coast. This summer I visited some areas
in the far north, and there met farmers who
for a quarter of a century had lived seventyfive miles from a railway. I repeat that with
such need in certain parts of the country, the
expenditure of huge sums on this beautification scheme and the tearing down of buildings
in Ottawa, where there is no possibility of
growing one cabbage to feed the hungry
world is one of the most ridiculous things
Canada has ever undertaken. The man who
engaged Mr. Greber to do this planning, for
a generous remuneration, once represented in
the other chamber one of the northern constituencies so much in need of rail service.
Speaking for myself only, I am against this
proposal to amend our constitution. I say the
country is not yet ready for it.
The motion was agreed to, on division.

ing in unemployment of about 200 workers?

To this the answer is that the government
has received representations regarding the
anticipated effect of the devaluation of the
British pound upon the pottery industry. The
government has been informed that some
reduction in employment has taken place
recently in a plant in Medicine Hat. It is
clearly too early to say how the devaluation
of the pound will ultimately affect the position of the Canadian industry.
The second part of the inquiry is:
If so, are steps being taken to make it possible
for the Canadian potteries to compete with the
British potteries?

In view of the answer to the first part of
he inquiry, the only reply I can make to this
atter part is that as it is too early to deter[nine what the ultimate effect of devaluation
will be, and that no steps have been taken
to enable Canadian potteries to compete with

HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
MOTION

Ehe Senate resumed, from Thursday, Nov,mber 3, the adjourned debate on the motion
of the Honourable Senator Roebuck that the
government be requested to submit to the
forthcoming Dominion-Provincial Conference
on the constitution a draft amendment to the
British North America ActHon. Wishari McL. Roberison: Honourable

senators, following the presentation of this
resolution by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), the
Qssistant whip (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) adjourned

Respect for and observance of these rights and
freedoms depends in the last analysis upon the
convictions, character and spirit of the people.
There is much to be said for the view that it
would be undesirable to undertake to define them
before a firm public opinion bas been formed as
to their nature. It is not evident to your committee
that such an opinion has reached an advanced stage
in Canada. There is need for more public discussion before the task of defining the rights and freedoms to be safeguarded is undertaken.

The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity has performed a public service by
introducing his resolution and giving honourable senators an opportunity to discuss the
matter. He has rendered a contribution particularly to that class of people whom I may
call new Canadians, who perhaps are not quite
as impressed as the rest of us with the principles and traditions behind our constitution,
and who may wish to see some provisions
written into our statutes. I therefore highly
approve and commend the contribution my
honourable friend has made. There are, however, one or two aspects of the question which
I should like to put before honourable senators
for consideration.
The resolution requests that the government submit to the forthcoming DominionProvincial Conference on the constitution a
draft amendment to the British North America
Act for the purpose of adding to the Act,
part XII to be known as "The Canadian Bill
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms". My honourable friend pointed out
that the phraseology of the resolution was
not his alone, but that much of it was contained in a resolution passed by the United
Nations, to which, of course, we subscribed.
I wish to draw the attention of the house
to the fact that the forthcoming DominionProvincial Conference, commencing January

NOVEMBER 10, 1949
10, 1950, is being called in pursuance of the
Prime Minister's letter to the premiers of
the provinces, "to consider a method of
amending the constitution in Canada". In
accordance with that invitation the delegations of the provinces and of the dominion
which attend will be prepared to discuss that
question only. As the subject is a complex
one, the feeling on the part of the members
of the government is that other complex and
controversial matters should not be introduced at that time. I think the cogency of
that conclusion is self-evident; and if my
honourable friend shares in this view I would
like him to consider whether it would be
wise to press his resolution, at least in this
particular respect. As I have said, the government feels unable to introduce any new subject at the conference; and it would seem to
me that if the conference is able to accomplish
what it has set out to do, without attempting
anything further, we may congratulate ourselves upon the progress that has been made.
The next point I want to make is this.
I was not present when my honourable friend
spoke on his resolution but, I note he said
that he would like the house to give it consideration. I am sure the house should and
will do so. He also suggested that after
the resolution had been discussed here it
should be sent to an appropriate committee,
where evidence could be heard. Assuming
that the remission of the matter to a committee is not accompanied with a specific
request that it be referred by the government to the forthcoming conference, I would
have no particular objection to this course
if it meets with the approval of the Senate.
But if the resolution were referred to a committee after a reasonable period, say a week
or so, had been devoted to its discussion, the
time necessarily required for organization
and the summoning of witnesses would make
it unlikely that the committee could hold
any hearings this session. Moreover, I would
point out that the activities of the Finance
Committee, and the program already before
the Banking and Commerce Committee,
including the consideration of the National
Defence Bill, when added to the other business which will come before us when the
"log-jam" on the other side is broken, will
involve a lot of work in the next two or three
weeks.
I suggest that my honourable friend consider first, that the government feels that it
cannot accede to that part of his resolution
which asks it to submit this matter to the
forthcoming conference; and second, that, as
far as the immediate future is concerned,
at least one of the members of the joint
committee who would like to speak to the
resolution is not yet prepared to do so. In
45785-1Sj

the meantime, if no other senator is ready
to speak, I shall ask the government whip
to again adjourn the debate, in order to
accommodate at least one honourable senator
who would like to speak. I do this in the
hope that others who are familiar with the
subject will contribute to the discussion as
it goes along.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien the debate
was adjourned.

November 15, at 8.30 p.m. -If we have a
great deal of legislation before us, I think we
should have a longer week-end in which to
study it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
may I say a word in reply? I frankly admit
that I have not much legislation to present

to the Senate. I shall have two or three
bills, none of great importance, to introduce
at the first of next week. The reason I have
suggested resuming on Monday night is that
there is a considerable amount of work to
be done in some of our committees. For
instance, we have arranged a meeting of the
Finance Committee for ten-thirty Tuesday
morning for the consideration of a very
important matter, and it is hoped to have
a meeting of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, after the Senate rises on Tuesday
afternoon, when representatives of the
Department of National Defence will be
present. If we make a practice of adjourning
the Senate from Thursday afternoon until
Tuesday evening, there will not be enough
members available on Tuesday to carry on
the necessary committee work. I have always
made it a point not to ask honourable members to come back here when there is nothing
to do, and I have no hesitation in saying
that there is important work to be done in
the Finance Committee on Tuesday morning.
The opinion of members of the committee is
that the work should be proceeded with. I
must ask that when we have work to do we
come here and do it.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, with
due respect to the leader of the government,
I think that his statement is not logical. It
is, of course, the duty of committee members
to be present when their committees meet, and
I am sure that a considerable number of us
will be at the Finance Committee on Tuesday
morning, whether or not the Senate sits on
the preceding evening. For the life of me
I cannot see why the fixing of a committee
meeting for Tuesday morning requires a sitting of the Senate Monday evening. In order
to be on time for that sitting I have to leave
home Sunday night. This is not merely a
personal matter, for a number of other senators are in the same position. We could
remain at home until Monday night and still
be in Ottawa on time for the committee meeting next morning. There will not be more
than ten or fifteen minutes' work to be done
in the Senate on Monday night, and I fail to
see why that could not be left over until
Tuesday.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
may I remind this honourable house that a
motion for adjournment is not debatable.

Hon. Mr. Euler: With respect, Mr. Speaker,
I do not think we are discussing a motion for
adjournment.
The Hon. the Speaker: If I remember correctly, I put the motion which was moved by
Honourable Senator Robertson and seconded
by Honourable Senator Copp.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understood the motion to
be that when this house adjourns today it
stand adjourned till Monday evening. That,
I think, is not a motion for adjournment.
However, I have said what I wanted to say.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion of Hon.
Senator Robertson, seconded by Hon. Senator
Copp, that when this bouse adjourns today
it stand adjourned until Monday, the 14th
of November, at 8.30 in the evening.
Hon. Mr. Frrland: Honourable senators, I
moved an amendment that the Senate adjourn
until Tuesday night. That is seconded by the
honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson).
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved in amendment, by the
Honourable Senator Ferland, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Paterson, that when the
Senate adjourns today it stand adjourned
until Tuesday, November 15, at 8.30 in the
evening.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators. may I
intervene for a moment at this stage? We in
this house who come from the Eastern and
Western provinces number 48, and our homes
are too far distant for us to travel back and
forth over the week-ends. So when the Senate
adjourns on Thursday afternoon we have to
stay here and wait till it meets again, which
is often not until Tuesday. That gets to be a
little tiresome, but we always are asked to
consider the convenience of members from
the two central provinces. The senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) says that in order
to be here Monday evening he must leave his
home the night before. Well, if he wishes to
be absent on Monday evening he may, for
every senator is allowed fifteen days' absence
during a session. Senators who live in the
Montreal district do not have to leave home
until about 4.30 Monday afternoon in order
to arrive in time for a sitting at 8.30. Perhaps
if I lived in Montreal or Toronto I would
strongly support the amendment, but as it is,
I feel that some consideration should be shown
once in a while for senators whose homes are
in the East and the West, and who have to
stay here day after day, week after week, as
long as the session lasts.

NOVEMBER 10, 1949
Hon. Mr. Euler: I certainly would be in
favour of coming back Monday night if there
was any real work to be done. The point is
that we do flot do anything on Monday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Quite a few of us do work
on the Divorce Committee, which has been
meeting four days a week-Monday, Tuesday,
Friday and Saturday.
Hon. Mr. Maraud: But practically no work
is done at Monday night sittings, which
usually last for only a f ew minutes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Whether the Senate sits on
Monday evening for five minutes or hall an
hour, the fact is that unless it does meet
Monday some of our distinguished friends
from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario
will flot he here in time for committee meetings on Tuesday morning. They are recognized
as men of great ability and we certainly need
their assistance. I should be loath to see anything happen that would deprive us of that.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question,
honourable senators, is on the amendment
moved by the Honourable Senator Ferland,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Paterson, that when this house adjourns today it
stand adjourned until Tuesday, November 15,

Hon. Mr. Sinclair: A point of order, Mr.
Speaker.
The amendment was discussed
bef ore there was a seconder, and I think it is
out of order to put the amendment now.
The Hon. the Speaker: I feel that the house
would prefer to vote upon the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: What is the decision on
the point of order, Mr. Speaker?
The Hon. the Speaker: My decision is that
the point of order is not well taken. I had
not concluded my remarks when the honourable senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Ferland) rose to speak. The question is on the

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I have
in my hand a copy of the report of the
Special Senate Committee of 1918, appointed
to determine the rîghts of the Senate ini
matters of financial legisiation. This report
contains the views of such prominent constitutional authorities as the late Eugene
Lafleur, K.C., the late Aimé Geoffrion, K.C.,
and the late John S. Ewart, K.C.
I am sure that this report would be helpful
to honourable senators when discussing constitutional amendments in the next few
years. As it is not a lengthy document, I
would ask, with leave of the Senate, that it
be reproduced as an appendix to today's
Hansard.
The Hon. the Speaker: 1 would informi the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that a reprint of this report has been
ordered, and copies will be distributed at a
later date.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
The Senate adjourned until Monday,
November 14, at 8.30 p.m.

TRADE WITH THE WEST INDIES
INQUIRY AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. J. J. Kinley rose in accordance with

the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to
the restricted state of trade between Canada and
the West Indies, and inquire as to what steps, if any,
have been taken by the government to improve the
situation.
He said: Honourable senators, when I gave
this notice I had in mind the weak position of

sterling exchange and the subsequent devaluation of the pound sterling by Britain and
other countries, and I thought that this was
a matter of considerable concern to the people

of Canada, especially to those of the Maritime Provinces. Since the notice was given
I have had communications which indicate
that along the coast, among fishermen and
those who do business in the West Indies,
there is considerable concern with regard to
this matter. I have also been spoken to by
several honourable senators who say they
have a special interest in this question, and
by members of the House of Commons who
have informed me that they are looking for
more information with regard to this situation, which seems to concern their constituents.
This inquiry gives us an opportunity to
discuss the subject of Canada's trade with

the West Indies. It is a subject of concern
to Canada generally, but it is of vital concern
to the Maritime Provinces, including the new
province of Newfoundland.
Trade with the West Indies has been a
major maritime

activity

since our earliest

days; it created industry both afloat and
and was
employment,
ashore, provided
always a vital factor in the economy of the
Maritime Provinces; so much so that this
trade is now considered a natural heritage
of the people long associated in this trade.
My native province of Nova Scotia was outstanding in marine activities, which were
greatest in the days of the sailing ship. Vessels were needed to carry on the fishing
industry and to market the products of the
fisheries and the forests. They were vital for
transportation. The West Indies was the
natural market for salted fish. This was a
route by sea to the south, and Nova Scotia
built the ships, manned them with her own
sailors, and carried the products to these
distant islands.
In those days the ocean was the best highway there was, and Nova Scotian vessels provided the fastest means of water transportation. Shipping developed enormously with
world-wide activity. Hundreds of squarerigged ships were built in Nova Scotia for
trade in the West Indies alone. They sailed
to the islands of the Caribbean with fish, lumber, farm products and manufactured goods,
returning home with cargoes of sugar, molasses, rum and -tropical fruits. They also carried large quantities of salt for our fisheries.
Our ships were good coasters and foreign
carriers. At that time Cuba and Porto Rico

belonged to Spain, and there were no coasting
laws to interfere with shipping to American
ports. A profitable trade circuit consisted of
the carrying of fish to the West Indies, sugar
to Boston, and general cargo home. This was
the golden era for the Maritimes. It passed
with the advent of steam and iron ships, but
our fisheries struggled on because of necessity, and trade with the West Indies was
continued.
After years of struggle the fisheries have
increased and fishing has again become a
leading industry in the Maritimes. Suddenly,
however, we find our industry imperilled, not
because of our weakness but because of our
strength as compared to others with whom
we carry on trade. The conditions are artificial and unstable, and we fear real difficulties are near at hand.
To give honourable senators an idea of the
potentialities of the West Indies market,

I will list the populations of the various parts

the trade between
British West Indies
On comparing them
first half of 1948, it

is apparent that our imports from the British
West Indies are increasing and our exports
to them are decreasing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Our imports during the
first half of 1948 amounted to $17,852,791,
and our exports to $31,390,072. It is apparent
that our exports to the British West Indies
decreased by nearly $8 million, and our
imports from them increased by about the
same amount.
The record for the market outside the
British area for 1948 is as follows:
Cuba ......................

Honourable senators know that the arrangement made in 1946 with the British Government is due to expire in 1949. That government bought sugar from all the British
possessions for the purpose of allocating the
supply, and our needs were included in the
allocation. I find that in 1948 we bought
from the Fiji Islands $8,275,231 worth of
imports-which I am told was mostly sugar
-and we sold to that colony only $491,908
worth of exports. It appears that the West
Indies biggest export is sugar, and that that
country is having difficulty with Great Britain
in getting its price for sugar. From the
changing trade arrangements in relation to
the marketing of sugar, it would appear that
we have shifted our trade somewhat from
the West Indies Islands.
The whole problem arises from Great
Britain's adverse trade balance, which in 1948
was almost $388 million. But there were other
considerations.
Our adverse balance with
the United States for 1948 was $305 million.
One must remember that by no means all
earnings appear in the trade statistics-ocean
freight for instance. Canada does not carry
much of her goods across the ocean; they are
carried largely by the sterling countries.
There is a big insurance business in Canada,
both marine and property, the figures for
which do not appear in the trade statistics.
Also there is ocean travel. Many people
travel to Great Britain and there spend their
dollars. There is also the factor of colonial
balances.
If we look at the figures we will find that
we imported in 1938 from Malaya to an

SENATE
amount of $21,878,318, and exported to that
country in the same year to the extent of
$1,709,056. I am told that the imports consist mostly of rubber, and are apt to diminish
in the future because we are depending more
on our production of synthetic rubber.
The figures for 1948 further show the
following figures:

Gold Coast ...............

Those are some of the other considerations

I mentioned a few moments ago.
Taking everything into consideration, I
think that what we gain in Great Britain by
way of favourable trade balance, we lose by
way of adverse balance of trade with the
United States. One almost cancels the other.
We must remember, however, that by means
of a special arrangement, Canada's trade with
Great Britain has been largely stimulated by
the Marshall Plan. What we really object to
is being shoved out of our natural market in
the West Indies, from which we import to a
large extent, and to which in turn export a
great deal, including fish and lumber from
the Maritime Provinces.

I am not familiar

with the lumber industry, but I have lived
alongside the fishing industry all my life and
know the

importance

of the West Indies

markets for salted fish. In fact, I do not know
where else it can be sold, except perhaps in
the Mediterranean area or to some of the
South American countries.

In my opinion the

salted fish market in the West Indies is vital
to the economy of the Maritime Provinces
and Newfoundland. The total export of fish
from Newfoundland in 1948 was $35 million
of a total export of fish by Canada of $90

million. Canada's sale of cured fish to the
West Indies in 1948 was as follows:
British West Indies ..................
Cuba .................................
Porto Rico ............................
Dominique Republic .................
H aiti .................................
Total ..........................

$3,298,000
2,200,000
926,000
746,000
570,000
$7,740,000

Newfoundland's export of cured fish, during
this period amounted to $7,477,000, of a total
export of $20 million.
Salted codfish is subsidized in the British
West Indies to the extent of from -3 to -8
cents per pound. This subsidy was increased
somewhat after devaluation. This creates an
artificial and insecure condition for trade; in
fact, Jamaica trade authorities are strenuously
endeavouring to get a cheaper supply from
soft currency countries, and it is known that
the Jamaica trade authorities are trying to
bring pressure on the Board of Trade to
induce the United Kingdom cod exporters to

supply their needs.

They also claim that

their subsidy funds should be used more to
encourage the local fishing industry. In this
regard I have a letter, received only today,
from a big fish exporter in the Maritimes.
I quote:
Trinidad was always an excellent market for Nova
Scotia codfish but due to devaluation of the pound
sterling Canadian codfish prices have advanced 36
per cent there. Previous to devaluation the Food
Controller of Trinidad had purchased at least 500
butts of codfish of 448 pounds each net every
month but due to devaluation our last shipment of
all Nova Scotia exporters was:
250 butts pollock, 448 pounds each net
125 butts codfish, 448 pounds each net.
Meanwhile the Food Controller of Trinidad had
called for tenders for 8,400 cwt. of ling and 3,600 cwt.
of saithe from the United Kingdom in order to save
Canadian dollars, and we are advised that a substantial quantity has been secured from this source
for shipments during November, December and
January, so it looks as if Nova Scotia will practically be excluded from that market due to devaluation . . .
The Newfoundland exporters and most Nova
Scotia exporters are withstanding the pressure from
foreign markets using American eurrency to reduce
codfish prices by 10 per cent, the amount of Canadian dollar devaluation, although this pressure for
this reduction is very persistent and strong at the
present tirne, most of the codfish sales being made
are at lower prices than those existing before devaluation.

A big competitor is likely to be Norway,
where currency is low. Just as soon as there
is an over-supply of fish there will be no sub-

sidy, and furthermore, the devaluation, as is
shown, makes it apparently advantageous at
the moment for the West Indies to seek other
sources

of

supply.

They

must

remember,

however, that Canada is a good customer of

the West Indies, and has been for generations;
and I think our records and experience all
go to show that it is eminently advantageous

for the West

Indies to

deal largely

with

Canada.
I think Norway at one time subsidized her
ships to meet competition. Perhaps Canada

could do that; the subsidy would be paid in
our own currency, and would at least bring
in new money from outside.
It would be an awful economic blow to the

Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland if
there were a deterioration of the market for
cured fish in the West Indian Islands. The
situation has been such for some time that
they would buy very little merchandise from
us if they could buy from sterling areas; but
fish being so important a food product has
been given more consideration. With regard
to other food products, I may say that when
I was in the West Indies I saw ships from
Austrlia lying at the wharf delivering farm

products from that faraway country, and a
press report last week reads as follows:
Indies to Trade with Australia
Sydney, Australia, Nov. 2: The West Indies is
willing to transfer Canadian and American trade-

NOVEMBER 14, 1949

iormerly

worth

$50,000,000-to Australia,

G.

E.

deMontbrun, Managing Director of a Trinidad im,porting firm, said tonight.
He said he hoped to buy $1,000,000 worth of goods
for his firm in Australia. Devaluation of the pound
had made American and Canadian prices so high
they were out of reach of the West Indies, he
added.

So while devaluation has only started, we
already have a vision of what it can do, not
only to the fish trade, but to the general trade
of Canada. The marketing of our farm
products will be much more difficult, even
in the West Indies, and our manufactured
products are practically shut out already,I know that personally from my own business.
However, news comes to us that some of the
British West Indian Islands are talking of a
federation, with a constitutional freedom
similar to that of Ceylon. It is a lively subject in the West Indies press, and there is
quite a bit of confusion in their thinking.
For instance, British Guiana has practically
decided not to go into the federation. Some
of these islands are more prosperous than
others, and, as we had our troubles in regard
to confederation, they are having their
troubles too, and it may be a long time before
they work thern out satisfactorily. I do not
think Canada would lose anything if the
West Indies became a separate economic unit.
The islands of Cuba, Haiti and Porto Rico
should be more favourable to us, especially
if they are able to supply a portion of the
immense amount of sugar we import.

It may

be that when we in Canada return to buying
our own imports of sugar the results will be
beneficial to our West India trade. It has
been suggested that the present arrangement
may not be renewed. Perhaps the time has
come in that respect when we should look
after our own interests.
With regard to manufactured goods
imported into the British West Indies, I think
it must be recognized that the policy is to
buy nothing from the hard currency area
which they can purchase in the sterling area.
Up to six months ago certain articles of food
produced in Canada and which could not be
bought from the sterling area, were going
quite freely into the West Indies. But that
is not the case with manufactured goods. It
is true that there was a quota of a kind, permitting a volume of Canadian exports based
on what previously had been exported
within a certain period. But at that time
most Canadian firms were either engaged in
war work or in the process of reconstruction
and change-over to peacetime operation:
having no quota, they were deprived of
admission to the West Indian market. I wrote
to the sales manager of a firm of which I am

president and asked him, "Will you let me
know about West Indies trade at the
moment?" He answered:
A reply to your request for a statement on our
present trade with the West Indies would be covered
by the statement that there just isn't any.
As you know, before the present monetary restrictions, we shipped steering gears, windlasses, hoists
and other deck machinery as well as fuel tanks,
marine engines, galley stoves and many others of
our manufactured products to practically all the
British islands in the West Indies, as well as to
British Honduras and British Guiana and also to
the French West Indies and Netherlands West Indies.
Since the last war we have had many inquiries
from our old customers and some new ones in that
territory and it is quite evident that they are as
anxious to trade with us as we are with them. Our
most recent inquiry was from Captain T. C. Barnes
of St. Barths. F.W.I. who imports through his agent,
Mr. E. Pereira, St. Kitts, B.W.I., the adjacent
island. His order, dated September 28, was for a
steering gear for a vessel with six inch rudder head,
72 rigging blocks and 30 gross of grommet rings
and his letter stated that he was Interested in a
Diesel engine. Not including the engine, his order
would amount to about $650. We wrote him that
we would require payment in Canadian dollars, and
suggested that he establish a credit with the Royal
Bank of Canada in St. Kitts so that his agent there
could take delivery of the shipment on arrival. At
the same time we wrote to trade and bank officials
for advice regarding the payments in this order.
As yet we have received no reply.

When I was in the West Indies last winter
I visited our agent in Barbados. They have
quite a fishing fleet under sail there, and it
appeared to me to be a splendid market for
marine engines. I went before the controller
to see if engines could be sent in there, and
he said be would think it over and let me
know. He finally turned down my request.
I then suggested to him, "Let me send some
goods on consignment, and you can pay me
when things get better", but he replied that
he could not do that. Well, my agent had an
old vessel plying between different ports,
carrying coal and other goods from one island
to another in the West Indies. He wanted
enough auxiliary power installed in his vessel
to enable him to putter along when there
was no wind. I conceived the idea of getting
a load of molasses for his vessel, to be
delivered to a port in my country where I
have some friends in the wholesale business.
I then said to the controller, "Would you
allow him to use the freight money he receives
to install the engine in his vessel?" and he
said no.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Who said no?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The controller in Barbados.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The controller of what?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Then my agent advised
me that the molasses shippers told him they
could not give him a load of molasses because
of an agreement they had made with Canadian National Steamship Company. He was

254

SENATE

told that this company had to carry all the
molasses or freight rates would be increased.
We have made several trade agreements
through the years. Sir George Foster made
one in 1912, and the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) was one of the
signatories to the West Indies Agreement of
1926. The steamship service was part of that
agreement. These agrements were based on
preferences, and Canada went to considerable
expense and built a fleet of steamships at the
instigation of Sir Henry Thornton. Unfortunately the war brought an end to many of
the ships, and only two, the Lady Nelson and
the Lady Rodney, are left. These beautiful
ships are still travelling to the West Indies,
but I would say that if we are to build newer
ones they should be faster. The vagabond
freighters we have recently built to ply to the
West Indies carry a limited number of passengers, but they are much faster and more
modern.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is their speed?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Fourteen and eighteen
knots.
As I say, the steamship service was part of
the West Indies Agreement of 1926, and the
government of Canada agreed to provide an
all the year round fortnightly service, passenger and mail, to Canadian ports. The
vessels were to call at the Leeward and Windward Islands, Bermuda, Trinidad and Demerara. In addition, there was established a
freight service to St. Kitts, Antigua, Barbados, Trinidad and Demerara. Towards the cost
of this service the representative of these
colonies agreed to pay £29,000, and if calls to
Tobago were cancelled their contribution was
to be reduced to £1,500. The Government of
Canada also undertook, for the western group,
a fortnightly service of mail, passenger and
freight ships, calling both ways at Bermuda,
the Bahamas, and Kingston, Jamaica, alternating with a fortnightly schedule directly
between Canada and Kingston, Jamaica. The
representatives of the colonies undertook the
following contribution towards such services:
per annum
Berm uda ...............................
£ 2,000
Baham as ...............................
2000
British Honduras ......................
2,000
Kingston, Jamaica .....................
12,000
From this it can be seen that Canada went
to considerable expense to establish trade
with the West Indies. The steamship line was
evidently built with the idea of securing
stability and continuity of service. But look
at our present position. That the situation
is disturbing the British West Indies is shown
by a press report that I have in my hand
about a West Indian federation. I do not
think that Canada would lose anything if
this federation should take place. However,

that is in the distant future, and we need to
do something now to bring about a healthy
situation.
Honourable senators, I was particularly
pleased that Newfoundland joined confederation. On March 27, 1946, which was the first
time I spoke in this chamber after being
appointed to the Senate, I spoke of the advisability of bringing Newfoundland into confederation. I said:
I have come to the conclusion, honourable senators, that in the national interest and also in the
interest of our fisheries we should try to induce the
dominion of Newfoundland to come into Confederation ...
In the Maritimes there is a feeling that Newfoundland is a competitor in the fishing business, and
that we should be inviting trouble by bringing her
into Confederation. I do not think there should
be much fear of that, because ber fishing vessels
have equal privileges with our own.
True, the
fishermen of Newfoundland have a little advantage
in that they have no income and corporation taxes
to pay. But I do think the very fact that they are
producers of the same kind of goods as we produce,
and competitors with us in world markets, should
encourage us to work together as one great country.

I wonder if the people in other parts of

Canada realize how much the prosperity of
the Maritimes depends on our exports,
especially fish.
We cannot eat our total production at home.
Rural Ontario consumes less than six pounds
of fish per person a year. The cities do a
little better. For instance, Toronto consumes
about 17-9 pounds of fish per capita yearly,
but the yearly per capita consumption of
meat is 135 pounds, and of sugar, I am told,
100 pounds. Then from a press report I read
that Canada's growing manfacturing industry
had its biggest year ever in 1948. It turned
out products of a gross value of $11,800,877,000, an average of nearly $950 for every
man, woman and child in the country. The
value of the production was 17 per cent
higher than in 1947, a record year up to that
time. This is a really wonderful record, compared with the figures for other years, and it
is clear that we must retain our markets.
What other countries must do from weakness
we should be able to do from strength. Money
circulating in our own country is not lost,
and I think we shall be obliged to stimulate
trade by subsidies. Then we should at
least be able to keep our own money in
circulation and bring in new money from
activities created and sustained.
A question that has often occurred to me
is: What is export trade? Well, export trade
consists in producing goods and performing
services for people in other lands and receiving goods and services from other lands in
return. The exchange of goods and services
creates an ocean trade, and if you have a
balance on the right side you feel that you
have a good export trade. That being so, it

NOVEMBER 14, 1949
occurs to me that as we have only a little
more than 12 million people in this country
it would be wise to bring in good classes of
people from other countries and have them

work and increase our consuming population,
and they would also add to our national
importance when we are bargaining for export
trade. It seems to me that selected immigration is the first thing that Canada should
undertake for the purpose of expanding her
trade and at the same time helping to make
this country more self-sustaining. Canada
could easily maintain 25 million people, and
I think we should make it our objective to
bring our population up to that level in the
near future.
We all approved of the British Trade
Agreement. Honourable senators will remember the so-called Ottawa Trade Agreement
that was made in 1932, I think, when Mr.
It largely
Bennett was Prime Minister.
superseded other agreements that we had
made with British Empire countries. The
monetary agreements of recent years are of
great importance to parts of Canada. It
is certainly necessary to market the wheat
of Western Canada, for instance, and the beef,
pork, butter, cheese and other farm products
of Central Canada and other agricultural
areas. But I cannot see how Nova Scotia will
profit very much from these monetary
Britain will not take our
arrangements.
salted fish, and there is nothing else we can
send from the Maritimes, except a little
lumber. In the present confused state of
world trade, with the emphasis on the
balancing of dollars and sterling, the interests of our fishermen and other people along
the Maritime coast are in danger of being
squeezed out of their small trade with the
West Indies, which is really only a North and
South exchange of goods.
We would not like to see British trade
operate as a factor in keeping us out of the
West Indies market. Special consideration,
I submit, should be given to our trade with
the West Indies. I think that our Department
of Trade and Commerce should point out to
the British authorities that Nova Scotia and
the other Maritime provinces have for generations traded with the West Indies and have
based their production on the existence of
markets there. Therefore, in whatever is done
in an attempt to balance the dollar situation,
special consideration should be given to the
maintenance of trade between the Maritime
Provinces and the British West Indies.
Cuba and Porto Rico are also important
markets that could be improved from our
standpoint. Newfoundland has a very important fish trade with Porto Rico. When it is

considered that we have a large adverse balance of trade with the United States and that
the Americans do not compete with us in the
West Indies market for salted fish, it might
be expected that they would help us to market
our goods in the islands of the Greater
Antilles. Cuba's economy has always been
closely allied to that of the United States, and
Cuba is very partial to American trade. However, we have a good fish trade with Cuba,
and it should be encouraged and developed.
Porto Rico is a part of the United States, and
devaluation of our currency will not hurt us
in that island. I am told also that there is
a great chance for improved trade with the
Dominican Republic. As you know, we took
our sugar trade away and transferred it to
the Far East. It seems to me that we should
make greater use of our purchasing needs for
tropical goods to extend the West Indies markets for the fish and other products of the
Maritime Provinces.
I do not like subsidies, but they are in
vogue, and really they are only a distribution
of our own currency among our own people.
If properly administered, subsidies help to
increase employment and mercantile activities. As honourable senators know, there
is at present an authority for a floor price on
fish. If the fish business got very bad, the
government could say to exporters, "You
must pay the fishermen this floor price, and
we will make good the loss you sustain in
marketing the fish abroad."
Strange things are happening these days;
and what we used to think could not be done
is a conimon occurrence now. We have
learned a good deal about money in late years.
For example, we have learned that money
is not wealth, but is only a medium of
exchange. I remember reading once that
Montagu Norman, former Governor of the
Bank of England, said that the money business had got into the realm of mystery.
We are strong enough to be able to see to
it that our trade with the West Indies is continued and expanded. It is a give-and-take
business which is mutually beneficial to the
people directly concerned.
The British West Indies have problems.
With the possible exception of British Guiana
most of the islands have export trade deficits.
This does not take into consideration the
tourist traffic. The Aluminum Company of
Canada has bauxite deposits located in British
Guiana and sends quantities of that product
to Canada, and that helps to create a favourable trade balance for that colony.
The facilities for doing business in the
West Indies are poor, especially in the smaller
islands. Their methods are primitive, and
the natives frown on the use of machines.
Over-population is becoming a problem, and

SENATE
the living standard is suffering. The old
question of the use of machines creating
unemployment has been argued many times;
but I would point to the United States, the
most highly mechanized country in the world,
where there is also the highest standard of
living. Economists say that the use of the
machine does not destroy employment, but
on the contrary creates employment. Some
of the British West Indies have wharves
and docks. Honourable senators will remember one, for instance, at St. Lucia, where I
believe the Germans torpedoed the Lady
Nelson during the war. There is a good
pier at Grenada, and also at Trinidad and
British Guiana. It should be pointed out
that at British Guiana the waters of the
Demerara River have brought down so
much silt that our boats can only go in with
half load. At Barbados large boats have to
lie off shore.
Canada might very well extend help, in the
form of loans, to improve trade conditions
with the West Indies. I recall that after the
First Great War we lent money to Roumania
and it was not repaid. Loans were made to
many European countrics, and we got little
out of them. Today we are lending money,
and we do not know whether it will ever
be repaid. It seems to me that because of
the proximity of the West Indies to the
American continent we could spend some
money to advantage in stimulating trade
between that part of the world and Canada.
We do not know how permanent will be
the trade advantages to be derived from
currency devaluation. Only time will tell.
In the meantime we should make every
effort to preserve trade that is natural and
reciprocal. That applies to our trade with
the West Indies, in which the Maritime
Provinces are vitally interested. I trust,
therefore, that our government will give this
matter full consideration.
Some Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, before the debate is adjourned, I should like
to ask my honourable friend from Queen'sLunenburg a question. I did not understand
what he referred to when he mentioned the
British Agreement.
What did my friend
mean by that?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: There have been three
agreements. The one in 1912 was made, I
believe, by Sir George Foster.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But my friend said that
Canada had an agreement with Britain which
was detrimental. To what agreement does
he refer?

Hon. Mr. Kinley: I refer to the agreement
whereby Britain undertook to take so much
of our wheat, bacon, cheese and so forth at
a price to be negotiated with our government.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: A bilateral agreement
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes. I say that we in
the Maritime Provinces do not benefit very
much by that agreement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Nor do we in the West.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not wish to continue
the debate, but I say quite candidly that I
have heard a lot of heresies tonight in which
I do not believe. My honourable friend
said that the British Wheat Agreement was
detrimental to the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That was what my friend
indicated.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: But I did not say it. My
remark was that it was of benefit to the
West.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But not to the Maritime
Provinces.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I said it was not as
beneficial to the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You said that it did net
b enefit the Maritime Provinces at all.
My honourable friend should read in the
daily papers what the British leftist members
of the government say: that they are going
Io ruin Canada because they are keeping her
by paying a high price for her wheat. Everybody in Canada knows that we lost money
on the price paid under the wheat agreement
as compared with the world price.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have had a loss of
between $350 million and $1 billion during
the period of the operation of the agreement.
The point which my honourable friend did
not touch on is that the sterling areas cannot
deal with us profitably because we are faced
with a proposition because the United States
choose to sell only about 10 per cent of their
total production outside of their own borders.
The other 90 per cent is disposed of within
their own territory. As a result, from 1886
to the present time the United States have
refused, by way of tariff arrangements, to
allow any part of the rest of the world to sell
to that country. All that the United States
are doing today is lending money to keep the
trade moving.
My honourable friend suggests that we
should lend money to the West Indies to
improve harbours and extend subsidies. Such
arrangements would only be temporary and
could not operate successfully under our

NOVEMBER 14, 1949
economic conditions. The world today faces
a situation which many people refuse to
recognize, namely, that Canada and the
United States have a surplus of goods to sell
which we must dispose of at a certain price
in order to maintain our standard of living,
but that the rest of the world has not sufficient
money to buy those goods. As long as that
situation continues we will have trouble.
Instead of making a speech to the Senate,
my honourable friend would have done much
better had he arranged a dinner engagement
with the Minister of Trade and Commerce,
and had that honourable gentleman tell him
what he proposes to do concerning Canada's
trade policy.
During the period from 1939 to 1948 there
was no difficulty in selling our goods to the
world. As long as Canada and the United
States lent their money by the millions and
billions of dollars, the rest of the world could
buy their goods. Now the shoe is starting
to pinch. My friend complained that the
Maritime Provinces could not sell their lumber and fish. I would point out that the rest
of the world cannot buy our goods at the
prices we must ask in order to maintain our
standard of living; and up to the present time
our people have refused to recognize that
problem. True, the government has given
certain subsidies. The price of butter is being
controlled, and now the western farmers are
demanding a floor price for wheat and cattle.
I am just wondering how soon someone will
ask for a floor price on manufactured goods.
As long as we lend money to Great Britain
and the European countries they can buy
our goods, but we have come to the end of
the road. Our currency is running out. The
government is already promising to put on
more restrictions.
I should have liked to hear my honourable
friend say something about the policy of the
government to meet the world-wide trade
problem. The honourable Minister of Agriculture has said that he hopes to renew the
agreements with Great Britain. I may be
wrong, but I do not believe the left-wing
labour members in Great Britain would talk
as they do if their government intended to
renew those agreements. Yet there must be
people in that country who like that kind of
talk, or we would not hear it. These men
are grossly misrepresenting the facts of the
case-facts known to every one of them.
Crossman, who is a well educated man-a
graduate, I understand, of Oxford-knows as
well as anyone that what he is talking is all
nonsense. He knows that the agreement we
made with Great Britain was wholly for their
benefit. We have received no word of thanks.
It is time that some of the leading British

Conservatives, who are the main opposition
party, and other supporters of the right-wing
in British politics, showed publicly some
appreciation of what Canada has done. I do
not know how a person like myself-and I
regard myself as a representative of the
common people--can be induced to buy
British goods when prominent people in the
United Kingdom make such nonsensical statements as that Britain is maintaining the
Canadian economy by buying our wheat when
she is buying it at half price. My honourable
friend from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) might as well realize that they will
never provide a market for the fish of the
Maritimes. The very day the wheat agreements came before this house I pointed out
that upon the expiration of these agreements
the British Government, far from making a new deal which would give us a profit,
would force us down to the very lowest figure.
Maybe someone will say, "Senator Haig, you
have no right to talk like that, because there
are in Canada many people who come from
Great Britain and who believe in the British
connection." Quite so, but everything in my
experience has confirmed my belief that the
Britisher is a hard bargainer-a very hard
bargainer; and if we are to get on in the world
we had better be hard bargainers too. Britain
is now negotiating with Russia for her grain,
and with Sweden for her pulpwood.
I think my honourable friend should have
pointed out these things, and he might have
admitted that some blame attaches to our
government. They were told what was
coming. If I may be pardoned a personal
reference: yesterday a newspaper reporter
said to me, "Mr. Haig, how did you guess
that the federal election would be on the
27th of June, 1949? You announced it, you
know, on the 3rd of February, but we thought
you were just jollying the boys along. How
did you guess the date so exactly?" I said,
"It was the simplest thing in the world. The
fact was 'writ large' in all the trade journals,
all the official interviews, all the trade
returns of this country, that the government
was riding into a storm, and they knew that
they would have to get to the people before
the storm broke; so as the latest date possible to them in June was the 27th, they went
to the country on the 27th of June".
Hon. Mr. Howard: And they had pretty
good results.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And they had good results,
as I thought they would when I predicted
the date. I said that if they picked June 27th
there would be trouble for their opponents.
But I am quite sure that the 27th of June,

SENATE
1950, will not be as propitious a date from
their point of view for an appeal to the
country.
I listened attentively to the speech of the
honourable senator for Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley), and I was delighted with it, but I
was disappointed that he did not offer any
solution. I have little personal knowledge of
the West Indies. However, when I visited
the islands a year ago as a representative of
Canada I was surprised at their trade possibilities. I can understand why the people
of the Maritime Provinces take pleasure in
trading with them, because the people are
very nice to deal with.
The honourable senator should have suggested how our trading problems are to be
solved. The people of the province I have
the honour to represent are seriously concerned about the prospects of marketing
their grain, their cattle and their hogs.
Probably the United States will buy our cattle and hogs, but they are not likely to want
our grain. A large part of the corn crop
which was harvested in the fall of 1948 in
the United States is still in bins, and the 1949
crop is coming in. All the grain crops of
last year remain unsold in American granaries, and now more grain is arriving. Somebody suggested the other day that the United
States would have to draw its wheat and
corn out into the Atlantic and dump it there.
I notice, too, that India is proposing that the
United States give them a large supply of
wheat. The word they use, "lend-lease" is
more polite than "gift", but the meaning is
the same.
I am concerned at the prospects for export
business. I appreciate the difficulties of the
Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland: they
affect the rest of the country. As yet,
Ontario and Quebec have not felt the pinch,
but I warn honourable senators from those
provinces, who are a little slow in realizing
the situation, that the outlook for the disposal of our primary products is not good.
The farmers of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and
Alberta are depending upon the government
to put a guaranteed price on their wheat. I
do not profess to be a financier, but it is my
belief that no country in the world can continue for any length of time to guarantee the
price of any product. Sooner or later it is
the world price which will be the dominating
factor. I am aware that in the United States
definite prices have been established for
grain, cattle, and other commodities.
It
remains to be seen how long they can be
maintained; maybe until 1952 when President
Truman has offered himself for re-election.
We in Canada may continue to sustain the
price of apples and some other commodities
of which production is comparatively small,

but we cannot long afford to do it for wheat,
fish or forest products. To me, as one Canadian, the situation is disturbing, and I want to
hear from the government what their policy is.
In this morning's Toronto Globe and Mail,
on the financial page, I read a reference to
a speech made by Mr. Donald Gordon in New
York a few days ago. What is the response
of the government to that statement? The
Minister of Finance denied that he had anything to do with the speech; but he knew
about it, he had a copy of it. I wonder what
answer the government can make to the
speech made by the honourable member for
Dufferin-Simcoe during the budget debate.
We need more trade: where is it to come
from? Already my honourable friend from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) is complaining that a large pottery plant in his city
has been closed down. It will not be long
until the honourable member from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill), who sells
props for the mines, will find that his business
is falling off. I think the goveroment leader
or some of his able confreres should tell us
what they are going to do to meet this problem, what encouragement they can give to
our people to meet whatever the future may
hold for them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: As a champion of the
farmers, is the honourable member opposed to
the government of the country protecting the
farmers against low prices by subsidizing
their products?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad my honourable
friend asked the question. As I said before,
no government can do that very long.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I asked a question. Will the
honourable senator reply, yes or no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer. Don't worry;
don't get excited.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not excited.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not the first time I have
been asked questions in this house. The
government may carry on that policy for
three or four years, but they will come to
the end of the road. With world conditions
as they are, big business cannot continue to
make the profits they are getting now. Where
are they going to sell their manufactures?
Not in Great Britain, which is now buying
extensively from the continent, and will buy
from Germany-the very nation it has been
fighting-once Germany gets on its feet. That
is what the British have always done.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They are buying from
Russia.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As my honourable friend
says, they are buying from Russia. They are

NOVEMBER 14, 1949

also buying from Czechoslovakia, from Yugoslavia, and all the other countries "behind the
curtain".
Hon. Mr. Baird: There is no sentiment in
business.
Hon. Mr. Haig: None at all. I agree with
you. But our government can only subsidize
wheat for perhaps a year or two because
subsidization can only be carried on when the
world has lots of money and has to buy
wheat. As an economic novice, I am not in
favour of continuing subsidies that cannot be
continued under any system of economy,
because ultimately world trade always governs the price that can be paid. There may
come a day when we from Western Canada
can say to the manufacturers of Ontario and
Quebec, "You have got to lower your prices
and admit foreign goods into Canada or else
we cannot sell our goods to other countries."
How can Great Britain buy goods from us
unless she can sell to us? How can I buy
goods in a store if I have not earned the
money with which to buy the goods? That
is the situation. No nation can maintain its
trade by subsidization, and Great Britain is
finding that out now. If it were not for
American loans the British people would be
bankrupt. They would be starved to death.
They thought they could subsidize anything
and hold it up, but they are finding out
differently, and are being forced to quit.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to
discuss this matter for so long, but I was
disturbed by the speech of the honourable
senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley). I appreciated the facts he gave,
because I know that he is probably as well
qualified as anybody in this chamber to give
us facts and figures about trade in the West
Indies. But I waited in vain for him to give
us a solution to the problem. He did blame
the government for making what we call the
British Wheat Agreement, but that is all. How
are the sterling areas to buy goods from us
when they have no dollars? I hope that before
this debate is concluded somebody on behalf
of the government will tell us what their plan
is to meet the present world trade situation.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I am not going to speak on behalf of the
government, for I am not in the government,
but because I have been watching Canadian
trade conditions and the actions of the government in regard to them. It would seem
from the words of the last speaker (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that the government is doing nothing
whatever for trade; but fron where I sit and
from wlat I see in the trade figures, I would
say that the government has done a good job
for the trade of Canada. Our country now

has a trade whose exports and imports are
practically in balance, whereas there is unbalance of trade in some other countries. I did
not know that this debate was coming on
tonight or I would have brushed up on my
figures. However, speaking from memory I
will give general figures that are correct. Our
trade with the United States in 1947 showed
an unbalance of nearly a billion dollars. Our
government took action at that time and
started to straighten out that unbalance, and
today it has been reduced to less than onehalf a billion dollars.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For this year?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: For this year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You mean 1948?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The latest figure-for
1948. They are continuing ta reduce the
unbalance of trade. One way to settle the
matter would be to drastically reduce imports
from the United States, but so far they have
not done that. The total trade of Canada has
increased during the same time that the government has funneled through trade to other
countries to balance their trade. At the present time there is a businessman's committee,
a dollar sterling committee, headed by Mr. J.
S. Duncan. This committee is doing a splendid
job. Throughout, the government has taken
Canada's trade and has tried to place our
purchases where they will balance sales to
other countries. That is the way they cut
down this unbalance with the United States.
In addition to restricting purchases from the
United States we have sold more to the
United States; but the government is
endeavouring to buy more from Great Britain.
In order to balance trade it bas encouraged
the importation of machinery, automobiles
and any other goods it can get from the
United Kingdom. We have trade with the
West Indies, and I think if my honourable
friend from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) were to compare the latest figures
with those of 1939, they would show up
pretty well.
It is true there will be dislocations at
times, but to charge that the Dominion
Government or the Department of Trade and
Commerce is sitting aside and doing nothing
is far from the truth. The government is
energetic in its efforts and is doing an
excellent job.
While we are at it, I think we might just
as well see what the 'government has done
with regard to finances as compared with
other nations. Even the United States has
not done the job that Canada has done. This
year they forecast a five and a half billion
dollar unbalance.

260

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but you must remember that they take into account the moneys
they send to Europe.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Surely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that covers it. We
did not give any.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Yes, we did. Out of
the $5 billion that went to Europe, we gave
one and a quarter billion. At the same time
we cut down our national debt half a billion,
whereas the United States has increased its
debt. I think ours is a good record for any
government. Our standard of living is high.
By paying off our debt we are building up
a cushion, so that if we have to give some
assistance to our industries, farmers, fishermen and others, the government will be in a
strong financial position to do it.
As far as the policy on subsidies is concerned, I think the government are in agreement with the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), because they have been cutting
down subsidies. Subsidies are only a palliative
and not a cure. They are used when the
workers in any line in some part of the
country need help to carry on for a short
while. I might say that as the government's
financial position improves it will be better
able to grant these subsidies.
On the West Coast we are probably concerned in export trade more than any other
part of Canada-even more than the Maritime Provinces-because while the export
trade of Canada is roughly from 33 to 35
per cent of the total, our trade in British
Columbia is 65 per cent export and 35 per
cent domestic trade. We are watching trade,
and we know that the trade of the world
is constantly shifting. This is not a new
experience. There was a shift of our lumbering business during the Bennett regime in
1932, and there will be shifts again in the
lumbering and other industries. The manufacturers of some products in the export field
have enjoyed such good business that they
have forgotten their local markets. I do not
want to mention any names, but there was a
lumbering company in British Columbia
whose exports to the United Kingdom ran
roughly to 70 per cent of their total business.
Well, the market died out, and the United
Kingdom did not buy any more of that firm's
product. They had said they would, but they
did not. This large concern, who were manufacturers of plywood, had to lay off one-third
of their employees. But instead of discharging the rest, they determined to make a real
effort on the local market, and decided to
spend $25,000 a month on advertising in
Canada. They arranged with jobbers to send
men on the road, and they paid half of the
salesman's salaries and expenses. Well, after

about four months that plant was running at
full capacity. The jobbers said to the company: "Please stop your advertising campaign,
for we have more business than we can
handle". The plant is still running full time,
supplying its products to purchasers in this
country. That is an instance of what can be
done by real initiative in selling. I think
the trouble in many lines of business is
caused by the lack of a good selling campaign.
A country-wide campaign is now being
started to increase the consumption of fish.
Canada exports more fish than any other
country in the world, yet our per capita
consumption is the lowest in the world. Why
do we not eat more fish? The answer is
that we have never done a really good selling
job. I believe that the present campaign
will induce Canadians to eat more fish, and
that in this way we shall take up a good deal
of the slack in our export.
Nova Scotia is not the only province that
has bad an apple surplus, for we have had
one in British Columbia. But here again
our people gave a lot of thought and hard
work to the sales end of the business, and
they have been quite successful. As a matter
of fact, we rather chaffed our friends in the
Maritimes when it became known that the
only apples on sale in the new province of
Newfoundland were from British Columbia.
That market was not obtained by sitting
down and asking the government to do something. It was enterprise which enabled the
sellers of British Columbia apples to do
business with Newfoundland, in spite of the
competition that would naturally be expected
from Nova Scotia, which is relatively close
to the island. I am not suggesting that British
Columbia knows more about selling than
other provinces do. On the contrary, I am
suggesting that the people in the other
provinces can do just as well if they will
continue to seek new markets.
I would like to say that this government
has been most co-operative in trying to assist
the British Columbia lumber industry-with
which I have been closely associated-and
also the fishing industry, in selling their
products on the United Kingdom market and
any other market where government help
could be given. When the going got tough,
as it is right now, the lumber companies
formed sales organizations. They are all
working together on the common problem
of selling their product wherever it can be
sold, anywhere in the world. So far as I
know, no subsidy has ever been paid on
lumber for export. During the war it was
sometimes said that the price obtained by
the government for wheat sold to Britain
was less than the farmers could bave got
elsewhere. Well, in those days the lumber
industry, not only in British Columbia but

NOVEMBER 14, 1949
in every other province, obtained on the
export market many times the price obtainable on the domestic market. In fact, at
times the mills suffered a heavy loss on
their domestic business. That was a contribution which meant much cheaper construction of houses and other buildings in Canada
than would otherwise have been possible.
No subsidy was paid by the government,
but the industry subsidized the construction
of houses and other buildings.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Houses have gone up in
price to three times their pre-war value.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I think you will find
that is chiefly because of increased labour
costs. The cost of lumber that goes into a
house is only a small percentage of the total
cost.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Lumber that was sold
locally at $12 per thousand feet before the
war went up to $100. That is a direct factor
in the high cost of housing. Our grain was
taken from us at a low price, but the lumbermen got four times the former price for their
product.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The lumbermen of
British Columbia did not get four times the
former price.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is what we had to
pay on the prairies.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The extra price there
may have been due to transportation costs
and charges made by local lumber yards,
but the domestic price at the mills was held
down by the government to at least $15 or
$20 a thousand feet less than the export price.
If that is not a subsidizing of lumber by the
lumber industry, I do not know what it is.
I am sorry that I was not prepared to take
part in this debate. In closing, I just wish
to repeat that the government has not subsidized the export of lumber, but has done all
it can to help the industry obtain new markets. Officials of the Department of Trade and
Commerce and of our own government in
British Columbia co-operate with the industry's own sales organizations every day, and
they are getting results.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
the question raised by the honourable senator
from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
relates to our trade with the West Indies. He
claims it is in a rather restricted state, and
he wants to know what the government is
going to do about it. My honourable friend
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
poses the same question, only with a great
deal more vehemence. He was extraordinarily accurate in reading the stars as to the

date of the last election, and perhaps he
could also read in the stars the solution to
our trade problem.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not my duty.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: He calls upon the government to do something. The honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) states
that the government has really done a great
deal about thisHon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and that on the whole
we have been pretty fortunate.
After that bit of light talk, I wish to say
that I think it is important that we should
understand-at least, I certainly want to
understand-the causes that have led to the
present unbalance of trade and how it can
be cured. There is no doubt whatever that
this condition has resulted from the terrific
dislocations created by the war, mainly in
Europe. Before the war we always sold more
to Britain than we bought from her, and we
always bought from the United States more
than we sold to them. There is nothing new
in our importing from the United States
today more than we are selling to them. That
has atways been our position. But before
the war currencies were convertible. The
surplus pounds that we got from Britain
could be changed into United States dollars
and used to pay for the excess of imports
from the United States over our exports to
that country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Is it not true that prior
to the war the sterling area other than Britain
sold us more than Britain did?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That may be so. I did not
expect to take part in this debate, butHon. Mr. Haig: My friend always gets up
after I make a speech.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: For instance, the sterling
area sold us rubber, tin and similar commodities.
I wish to go back to my theme, which was
somewhat interrupted by my honourable
friend's question. I repeat, we were always
in the position of buying from the United
States more than we sold to them; but because
our currencies were convertible, we could
pay for the surplus purchases from that
country with surplus pounds which we earned
in Great Britain. That arrangement has gone
for the time being-gone with the wind.
We must understand that for five years,
during the recent war, Great Britain's
exports to the world practically ceased. Her
factories were not producing the boots and
shoes and electrical equipment which could
have been sold in other parts of the world,

SENATE

but were making airplanes, guns and munitions. That tremendous upset in the British
economy could not be corrected in a few
years. Other countries of Europe suffered in
the sarne way, but to a lesser degree. Canada
recognized that problem when she agreed to
lend Great Britain a million and a quarter
dollars. Our loans since the war to Great
Britain and European countries total almost
$2 billion.
The United States saw the problem, perhaps, from another point of view. It did not
want western Europe to go down in despair
and anarchy, so the Marshall Plan was
evolved. The simple reason for it was to
bolster the economy of Great Britain and the
European countries; and to try to get them
back on their feet.
We may be critical of Britain's domestic
policy. Personally, I think she has made some
rather serious mistakes in the conduct of her
domestic affairs. Now that these credits are
running out, the question is whether she can
build up her exports to Canada within the
next few years to the point where, when the
Marshall Plan is through, we can again
resume our trade with her on other than a
charge account basis. The Marshall Plan is
nothing more than a charge account, and the
seller country operates in the same way as
did the merchant in the early days of the
West, when he sold on credit to farmers or
individual citizens. We all hope that Great
Britain and the European countries will soon
get back on their feet and again be good
customers of ours.
My honourable friend from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) stated a very
definite problem. He said that we should
sell fish and lumber to the West Indies and
take sugar in return, But, he added that the
Fiji Islands sold $8 million worth of sugar to
Canada. I would point out that Fiji is in the
sterling area, and when it sells $8 million
worth of sugar in Canada, that amount of
dollars goes into the sterling area to buy our
wheat, lumber and so forth. I do not think
we can do very much about such a situation,
and it is futile to criticize the government
because it is not curing it. The nations
of the world are caught in the grip of strong
forces, and it is going to take a long time
to adjust matters. Unless the Marshall
Plan is carried on, or some similar plan
is adopted, we are going to have trouble
selling our products to Europe for many years
to come. If we do not continue our loans to
Great Britain we may have difficulty in finding markets for our products. We should set

our own house in order, as far as it is possible
to do so, against that day.
I agree with the attitude of the honourable

leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) on the question of the wheat agreements. The honourable
member from Queen's-Lunenburg asked why
the Maritime Provinces did not enjoy a
similar agreement for the sale of their
products. I have never been a protagonist
of the wheat agreement between Canada and
Great Britain, becaus-e it cost the farmers of
western Canada several hundred million
dollars.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is questionable.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
from Queen's-Lunenburg, and the province
of Nova Scotia, got substantial benefits from
that agreement for the very reason that the
Canadian flour mills bought wheat on the
sane basis as that under the British agreement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They got it for less.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, they did.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: They made a good profit

at the price.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Did the people of

western Canada get the same benefits?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Then why did not
the Maritime Provinces get something?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: J am merely saying that
had the markets been open, so that we could
have sold our wheat to the world, my honourable friend from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) and my honourable friend from
Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan)
would have paid a good deal more for their
bread during the past four years than they
have paid.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: My honourable friend
should not overlook the fact that while the
domestic consumption of four was made
from wheat bought at the basic price of about
70 cents, there was also a processing tax,
which meant an increase in the cost to the
consumer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: In the end, the price

was practically the same as that at which
it was sold to Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is truc that the govern-

ment paid a subsidy, but the price paid for

NOVEMBER 14, 1949
wheat which went into Canadian consumption was fixed on the basis of the British
wheat agreement; therefore the consumers in
Canada benefited to that extent.
Before I sit down, honourable senators, I
wish to say that this imbalance of trade, or
this so-called dollar problem, is not something which can be cured by some sleight-ofhand on the part of a government here or
Before we have passed
anywhere else.
through these troubled times we will have to
exercise all the patience and forbearance we
can bring to our aid.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard the debate
was adjourned.

CANADA'S TRADE
EXPORTS AND

IMPORTS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
with the leave of the Senate, I should like to
put on record some figures about which I was
asked last night, and which I could not then
present up to date.
In 1947 the total value of Canadian exports
to all countries was $2,812 millions, and of
all imports $2,574 millions, leaving a favourable trade balance of $238 millions. We
exported to the United States in the amount
of $1,057 millions, and imported $1,975 millions, making a deficit of $918 millions. To
the United Kingdom our exports were $754
millions, and we imported $189 millions, the
United Kingdom deficit being, therefore, $565
millions.
In the nine months ended September 30.
1949, our exports to the United States were
$1,039 millions, and our imports from that
country were $1,471 millions, representing a
deficit for nine months of $432 millions as
compared with $918 millions in the previous
twelve months. Our exports to the United
Kingdom amounted to $529 millions, and our
imports, to $240 millions, or a difference of
$289 millions for nine months as compared
with $565 millions for the full year 1947. It
is difficult to express the statistical position
in terms of a full year, because, owing to
devaluation, imports from Britain will be
greater than they would have been otherwise;

while our exports to the United States will
increase and our imports from there will
decrease. But leaving these considerations
out of account, our total imports in the current year are estimated at $2,889 millions,
and our imports at $2,665 millions, representing a total trade for Canada in 1949 of $5,554
millions, against a total of $5,386 millions in
1947.
HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS

MOTION
The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 10, the adjourned debate on the
motion of the Hon. Senator Roebuck, that the
government be requested to submit to the
forthcoming Dominion-Provincial Conference
on the constitution a draft amendment to the
British North America Act.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak to this motion, I wish first
to state that I am fully in accord with the
suggestion made in this chamber last week
by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that the time is not fitting for this
particular motion to be accepted. In that
regard I wish to take the liberty of reading
the motion, because if it were not withdrawn
I should have to oppose it. Although it contains a number of articles, the main part is
as follows:
That the Government be requested to submit to
the forthcoming Dominion-Provincial Conference on
the Constitution the following draft amendment to
the British North America Act:
1. The British North America Act, 1867, is hereby
arnended by adding thereto the following part,
which shall be known as "The Canadian Bill of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."

By this motion we ask the government to
submit to the conference with the provinces
which has been called for January 10,
certain amendments to the constitution, which
in effect would require the ten provinces to
surrender some of the rights which are
theirs. As pointed out by the leader of the
government, the conference has not been
called for that purpose. In a letter of the
Prime Minister dated September 28 last, he
asks for this conference "with a view to
working out a method of amending the constitution in Canada which would be satisfactory to all Canadians". That is the sole
purpose of this particular meeting. It is not
to decide or discuss what changes should be
made; it is merely to set out conditions under
which the constitution may, as deemed necessary and advisable, and with the consent of
the provinces, be amended subsequently from
time to time.

NOVEMBER 15, 1949
I propose to give a brief history of this
whole question of human rights as it has been
considered before the United Nations. But
first, may I compliment the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
as the leader of the government has done, for
having brought this matter, through this body,
before the public at this time; and this I do
while not agreeing with the substance of the
The honourable senator from
motion.
Toronto-Trinity in his speech on the motion
made particular reference to Mr. B. K. Sandwell, the chairman of the committee dealing
with human rights in Canada. I hope that
neither the honourable senator who has
moved this motion, nor Mr. Sandwell, whom I
hold in very high regard, will feel that my
opposition, or that of any other senator, is
motivated by any feeling of personal animus,
or that I am lacking in appreciation of the
work that men like Mr. Sandwell have done,
over a long period of years, to bring about
good will within Canada.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) also mentioned
the joint committee of the Senate and House
of Commons, which for a couple of years
studied this question of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, and he expressed disappointment at the lack of definite action
taken by that committee. Well, to some
extent I accept responsibility for the disappointment that has come to my honourable
friend, because not only was I a member
of that committee, as he was, but on one
occasion I suggested that the proposal-it
was then only a proposal-made by the
Human Rights Commission of the United
Nations, and which was before our parliamentary committee for study, was not properly speaking so much a basic Bill of Rights
as it was a political doctrine or statement
of general policy which might be adopted by
a political party as the basis of its work in
its own country. My point was that at that
time it was not a definite Bill of Human
Rights which could have been put into a
constitution, because of the fact that a constitution is a document which might be subjected to dispute or question from time to
time in the courts of the land. That is a
point we must be careful about when we are
amending the constitution to provide for a
Bill of Rights.
Article 56 of the Charter of the United
Nations is nearly always referred to in any
discussion on human rights. It reads:

Now, Article 55 contains three different
sections or proposals. The article begins as
follows:
With a view to the creation of conditions of
stability and well-being which are necessary for
peaceful and friendly relations among nations based
on respect for the principle of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, the United Nations
shall promote:

Then follow three clauses, a, b and c, of
which I shall read only the third:
c. universal respect for, and observance of, human
rights and fundamental freedoms for all without
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.

That is one of the purposes contemplated
by Article 56, in which all members of the
United Nations pledge themselves to take
joint and separate action in co-operation with
the organization for the achievement of the
purposes set forth in Article 55.
It has been stated by at least one noted
philosopher that a democracy is the worst
form of government, because in a democracy
a minority is always subject to the will and
dictation of a majority. I am not going to
enter upon a detailed discussion of that
question, but I want to say that every member of the Canadian parliament can with
complete justification rise and deny that
statement. If I may introduce a personal
note, I would point out that I am a member
of a minority and have lived most of my life
in two Western provinces, British Columbia
and Alberta, where I have been active in
business and politics since 1907. I am in
what might be called a double minority, for
I have a name that most of my constituents
could not pronounce, and in religion I am a
Catholic, living almost surrounded by people
of non-Catholic faiths; but at no time whatever have I suffered in the slightest degree
because of being a member of a minority in
racial or cultural origin and in religion.
As I have said, I wish to place on record
some of the steps that have been taken by
members of the United Nations with respect
to human rights and fundamental freedoms,
and the measure-for as yet it is only a
measure-of success that the United Nations
organization has so far achieved. The Commission on Human Rights was established by
the United Nations in June or July of 1946,
but it was not until December 1948, that is
after practically two and a half years of work,
that it succeeded in having the Declaration of
Human Rights accepted by the General
Assembly of the United Nations. That declaration is not a covenant. The Commission
on Human Rights was empowered to draft
Ail membersa declaration of human rights, and a covenant,
That is, all members of the United Nations. which in itself would take the form of a
charter with a more or less binding effect
-pledge
themselves to take joint and separate
action in co-operation with the organization for the upon the various member states of the United
achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55.
Nations which accepted and signed it, and

SENATE
the commission was also empowered to carry
out measures implementing the covenant
after it had been signed. But so far, although
eleven months have passed since the Declaration of Human Rights was accepted by the
United Nations, no further successful step
beyond the making of that declaration has
yet been taken. And that declaration is only
a recommendation to the world, particularly
to the members of the United Nations.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? Would he tell us
what stand Canada took when the declaration
was presented to the United Nations?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I intend to do that,
Senator.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The Commission on
Human Rights has not yet agreed to the
covenant or the measures ýto implement it;
and after these things have been agreed upon
by the commission, it will have to present
them to the General Assembly of the United
Nations for acceptance.
And now I come to the question as to what
stand Canada took. To begin with, Canada
was not a member of the Commission on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
and when the commission first presented a
proposed declaration to the Economic and
Social Council-not to the General Assembly
of the United Nations-Canada abstained from
voting. However, when that declaration was
formally presented to the United Nations,
Canada voted in favour of its acceptance.
That was at a meeting of the General
Assembly of the United Nations, and on that
occasion the Canadian delegation made a
statement, which I will read by way of a
direct answer to the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis):
Before a vote is taken on the Draft Declaration
of Human Rights in the form which it has now
taken, I wish to make clear the attitude which the
Canadian Government adopts, generally, towards it.
In the first place, we regard this document as one
inspired by the highest ideals; as one which contains a statement of a number of noble principles
and aspirations of very great significane which the
peoples of the world will endeavour to fulfil, though
they will make these efforts variously, each nation
in its own way and according to its own traditions
and political methods.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Who made that statement?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am not sure who
headed the Canadian delegation, but that is
the official statement made on behalf of the
Canadian delegation to the General Assembly,
December 10, 1948. The statement continues:
So far as the position of Canada in regard to the
maintenance and extension of human rights is concerned, we shall, in the future, as we have in the
past, protect the freedom of the individual in our

country where freedom is not only a matter of
resolutions but also of day-to-day practice from
one end of the country to the other.
The freedoms to which I refer have developed in
Canada within the framework of a system of law
derived both from statutes and from the judgments
of the courts. We have depended for the protection
of the individual upon the developments of this
system rather than upon general declarations. Because this method is in accord with our tradition,
we shal continue to depend on it and to expand
it as the need may arise. While we now subscribe
to a general statement of principles such as that
contained in this declaration, in doing so we should
not wish to suggest that we intend to depart from
the procedures by which we have built up our own
code under our own federal constitution for the
protection of human rights.
In this regard, there is a special circumstance
which applies to Canada. When some of the articles
of the Draft Convention were adopted in committee
the Canadian delegation abstained, explaining that
the subject under consideration was in some of its
important aspects within the field of provincial
jurisdiction in Canada.

I pause here to direct this passage to the
particular attention of honourable senators,

because of the nature of the conference of
January 10-a conference of federal and provincial representatives to deal with ways and
means of amending the constitution.
I wish to make it clear that, in regard to any
rights which are defined in this document, the
federal government of Canada does not intend to
invade other rights which are also important to the
people of Canada, and by this I mean the rights of
the provinces under our federal constitution. We
believe that the rights set forth in this declaration
are already well protected in Canada.
We shall
continue to develop and maintain these rights and
freedoms, but we shall do so within the framework
of our constitution which assigns jurisdiction in
regard to a number of important questions to the
legislatures of our provinces.
Because of these various reservations on details
in the Draft Declaration, the Canadian delegation
abstained when the declaration as a whole was put
to the vote in committee. The Canadian delegation,
however, approves and supports the general principles contained in the declaration and would not
wish to do anything which might appear to discourage the effort, which it embodies, to define the
rights of men and women. Canadians believe in
these rights and practise them in their communities.
In order that there may be no misinterpretation of
our position on this subject, therefore, the Canadian
delegation, having made its position clear in the committee, will, in accordance with the understanding
T have expressed, now vote in favour of the resolution, in the hope that it will mark a milestone in
humanity's upward march.

That quotation is from a statement made
by the Canadian delegation to the General
Assembly of the United Nations in December,
1948, when the declaration was adopted. As
I pointed out, that declaration is simply a
recommendation made by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Every member of
the United Nations did not vote for it, but
nobody voted against it, although there were
half a dozen or so abstentions.
I have already pointed out that the Human
Rights Commission of the United Nations has
not yet reached agreement upon the proposed

NOVEMBER 15, 1949
covenant, nor upon measures of implementation. A resolution relating to the preparation
of a draft covenant and draft measures of
implementation was passed by the General
Assembly after the declaration was issued.
The General Assembly, considering that the plan
of work of the Commission on Human Rights provides for an international bih of human rights, to
include a declaration, a covenant on human rights,
and measures of implementation, requests the Economic and Social Council to ask the Commission on
Human Rights to continue to give priority in its
work to the preparation of a draft covenant on
human rights and draft measures of implementation.

With one exception, that is the last quotation I intend to make, because I support the
suggestion already made by the leader of the
government that this motion should not be
adopted, by reason of the fact that it definitely declares that the government should
make certain representations to the forthcoming conference. But I desire also to show
that Canada generally is in definite agreement with the aspirations contained in the
declaration, and that I am sure all provinces,
as well as the federal authority, will do
everything humanly possible to improve
present conditions. Whether such further
action will require an amendment to the constitution-as I am inclined to believe-must
depend on the view taken by federal and
provincial authorities of the subject in its
entirety as it affects Canada.
In this connection I wish to read Article 30
of the declaration. I believe that a knowledge of it would create greater confidence in
the minds of members of the provincial legislative assemblies and ministers of the various
This, the final
provincial governments.
article, reads as follows:
Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted
as implying for any state, group or person, any
right to engage in any activity or to perform any act
aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and
freedoms set forth herein.

"Herein", of course means within the declaration itself.
Now, honourable senators, I thank you for
your courtesy, and would reiterate that I,
like the leader of the government and others,
while deeply appreciating the work which
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
and those associated with him are doing along
this line, firmly believe that at this time, in
view of preparations for the conference next
January, this motion should not be proceeded
with. I thank you.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, in
rising to say a few words on this motion, I do
so more in support of the general principles
enunciated in the resolution than of any particular view on the question of whether or
not the resolution should be referred to the

coming conference of January 10 next. I
believe that the honourable senator who
introduced this resolution has an open mind
on that subject, but feels that this is an opportunity to have a discussion on the general
principles involved. So, as a former member
of the Joint Parliarnentary Committee on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
I should like to say a few words in addition
to what has already been said, and perhaps
approach the subject from a slightly different
angle frorn that taken by my male colleague.
Encouragement to do this stems from two
sources. The first is ta be found in section
12 of the resolution, followed by article 4,
which states:
Everyone has the right to recognition throughout
Canada as a person before the law.

I perhaps have particular reason for
stressing that sentence in Article 4. Since
the right of appeal to the Privy Council has
been abolished, and since it has been decreed
that it would be unwise to have the rule of
stare decisis with regard to previous decisions
of the Privy Council written into our statutes,
it is comforting to know that if this resolution ever becomes embodied in the constitution of Canada, members of my sex will still
be considered "persons".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The second source from
which I derive encouragement is the preamble
to the charter of the United Nations, which

affirms belief in equal rights of men and
women the world over. And the delegates to
the United Nations have taken action toward
recognizing this faith in a tangible way. In
February 1946 the Commission on Human
Rights, whose president at that time was
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, appointed a subcommission to make a survey of and recommendations concerning the status of women,
and its report was turned in to the Commission on Human Rights in the spring of
1946. I should like honourable senators to
listen to one of the subcommission's main
recommendations. I must confess that I read
it with a smile. It says:
Members considered that the work of the subcommission should last until the point had been reached
where women the world over were on an equai
footing with men in ah fields of human endeavour.

Well, that is wonderful theory, but if the
members of that commission sit until it is
achieved in actual practice, they will have
imposed a life sentence upon themselves and
their successors.
That women have an interest which is certainly equal to that of men in the whole question of peace and war-which, after all, is
the basic issue underlying all foreign policy
-is, I think, conceded by everyone. That

SENATE
being the case, it seems to me only logical that
every country should give its women adequate
representation at all international gatherings.
We in this country are inclined to be rather
smug about our thinking, which we believe to
be advanced as compared with that of a
country such as, say, India. Yet while Canada has this year for the first time sent a
woman delegate to a meeting of the United
Nations General Assembly-my colleague
from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson)Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: -the fact is that for two
or three years India has had women representatives at the United Nations Assembly.
Not only that, but last year the delegation
from India was headed by a woman, in the
person of Madam Pandit, sister of Prime
Minister Nehru of India; and, as honourable
senators know, she has since been appointed
Ambassador from India to the United States.
Just in passing, I might also call attention
of honourable members to the fact that the
women of Canada did not receive the franchise until after the First World War, although
many years prior to the outbreak of that war
Finland, Norway and New Zealand had
granted to the women of their respective
countries full political equality with men.
I do not know that we in Canada have anything to be very complacent about in this
respect.
The latest report from this subcommission
of the United Nations tells us that women are
serving with cabinet rank in eleven countries, and in many instances have also diplomatic recognition as ambassadors and ministers to foreign lands. Finland, incidentally,
was the first country in the world to grant
suffrage and representation in parliament to
its women. Today, forty of Finland's two
hundred members of parliament are women,
and one of these women has been chosen by
the President to be Minister of Health, Welfare and Social Services. So it would appear
to me that in the matter of human rights as
it pertains to recognition of women as persons, without discrimination as to sex,
Canada lags sadly behind some other
countries.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) spoke of the fact,
which was also referred to by the honourable
gentleman who preceded me (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), that very little, if anything, was accomplished by the joint committee of both houses
on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
I agree with that statement. It seemed
exceedingly difficult to get started in that
committee. I recall asking at either the first
or second meeting of the committee if we
could be given the United Nation's definition

of fundamental freedoms, so that we would
have at least something tangible towards
which to work, and I was told that up to that
time the United Nations had not been able
to agree upon a definition which would be
acceptable to the various participating countries. I think we can readily understand that.
Ideas of what constitutes freedom vary widely
in different countries. But while we in
Canada may not be able to influence directly
the thinking of people in those countries
whose ideology is different from ours, there
is much that we can do in our own land. We
can, as has been suggested in this resolution,
embody in our laws, we can embody in our
national way of life, all those ideals of human
rights in which we profess to believe and to
which we so glibly give lip service, but which
we often are slow in putting into practice.
May I give just one example? The Joint
Parliamentary Committee on Indian Affairs,
of which I was a member, held sittings over
a period of three years. I think members of
this house who sat with me on the committee
will agree that the briefs presented to us and
the evidence given by witnesses representing
various Indian bands from coast to coast
showed that by no stretch of the imagination
could it be said that in our treatment of these
Canadians of Indian descent we have always
embodied all the principles of human rights
of which we now talk so freely.
On the question of protection of individual
rights against governmental encroachment,
the honourable senator who introduced the
resolution (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made the following statement, as reported at page 217 of
the Senate Hansard:
The present generation of Canadians have been
through two great wars, periods of stress and crisis
in which the safety of the nation overshadowed for
the moment the rights of the individual, and in
which our organization for total war necessitated
an economic planning and control to an extent previously unknown. The danger now is that these
encroachments on individual rights may become
permanent.

To show that this tendency is not confined to
Canada, may I read you a short paragraph
from an editorial in a recent issue of Saturday
Night, published in Toronto, entitled "Freedom is Important":
The keynote of the great speech made by General
Dwight D. Eisenhower in the recent Herald-Tribune
Forum in New York was the call to every American
"to consider, so far as each of us can, the probable
effect of every new governmental proposal upon
our personal freedom." There is no task to which
Americans and Canadians alike more greatly need
to be called in this bewildering age. There is no
task to which less attention is being given.

Here then, both in the statement made by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
and the statement made by General Eisenhower, and the comment on General Eisenhower's statement by Saturday Night, lies

to call this matter to the attention not only
of members of this house but of the public at
large.
Turning just for a moment to another
phase: the honourable senator who leads
this house, in speaking to this resolution had
this to say, as recorded on page 246 of the
Senate Hansard.
He spoke of the service which the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity had
:endered in bringing this question to the
attention of the house. Then he said:

ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES BILL
SECOND READING
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 147, an Act to amend the
Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) to handle this
bill.
Hon. J. A. McDonald moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases
Act, which is Chapter 6 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927. The Act was first
passed by parliament in August 1903. The
Federal Department of Agriculture, under
both Liberal and Conservative governments,
with the co-operation of provincial departments of agriculture and, in many cases, of
farmers' organizations in the provinces, have
done a truly great work in public health in
carrying on during the years under the
provisions of this legislation. I am sure
honourable senators will agree that in this
way much has been done to prevent the
importation of diseased stock and in cleaning
The
up our herds of diseased animals.
department has actively tried by one means
or another to remove many contagious
diseases, and has accomplished a great deal;
but I cannot help feeling that so far as Bang's
disease is concerned the departmental policy
has perhaps not gone far enough in cleaning
up our herds throughout Canada. I know
some districts that are still heavily infested
with Bang's disease. As honourable senators
know, humans who drink milk from cows
infected with Bang's disease may contract
undulant fever, which causes a lot of human
suffering and, in some cases, death. Bang's
disease can be pretty well controlled by
vaccinating the cows and by the carrying
on of work among herds throughout farming
communities, under the direction of the
department. I feel that in order to successfully clean up Bang's disease the department may have to adopt a policy similar to
that followed for control of tubercular cattle,
and offer some compensation for the reactors.
The purpose of this bill is to provide additional compensation to the owners of cattle

which when tested are found to have bovine
tuberculosis, and whose carcases when sent
to the slaughter house are condemned as unfit
for human consumption and sent to the tanks.
Up to the present time the only compensation
given to owners of such carcases, when condemned as unfit for food, has been the price
of the pelts, which has averaged about $10.
If this measure which we have before us
today is approved, in future the carcases
which are tested for bovine tuberculosis and
condemned as unfit for consumption and sent
to the tank, will be paid for on the same
basis as other reactors which have been
similarly tested, but whose meat has not
been injuriously infected and is sold to
abattoirs as canners or cutters. I believe
that the present price for that meat is about
11 cents a pound.
Since April 1, 1947, the average compensation received by the farmer for animals
that have reacted to the bovine tuberculosis
test has been about $60 per head for the meat,
plus from $38 to $40 paid by the Minister or
someone appointed to represent him under
the Act.
This bill proposes to repeal paragraphs (a)
and (b) of subsection 2 of section 14, and
also section 15 of the Act. These sections
14 and 15 have to do with the fixing of the
maximum price which may be paid by the
minister or his representative for animals
that are diseased. These changes honourable
senators, will not affect the maximum
amounts paid on horses and cattle.
Paragraph (a) of section 1 of the bill provides that a maximum amount of $200 will
be paid for pure-bred animals, and $100 for
grade animals. For the benefit of the honourable member from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), I may say that for the purposes of
this legislation "pure-bred animals" means
registered and standard-bred animals. Paragraph (b) states that in the case of cattle $100
will be paid for a pure-bred animal and $40
for a grade animal.
Some increases are allowed for sheep and
swine. In the case of swine the allowance is
$50 for a pure-bred animal and $30 for a
grade animal. This is an increase of $15 for
grade carcasses. In the case of sheep, the bill
provides for the payment of $50 for a purebred and $20 for a grade animal. The latter
is a small increase of $5 a head.
If the bill is passed, section 3 will give the
department the authority to pay for carcasses
consigned to the tanks the compensation
which I have mentioned, retroactive to April
1, 1947. On inquiry as to why that date was
selected, I was told that during the recent
war years very little testing was carried on

NOVEMBER 16, 1949
because it was almost impossible to get
experienced and skilled veterinarians to do
the work; and that f rom about April 1, 1947,
area testing was resumed. Since that time
the authorities have found a great many
reactors, especially in some of the beef areas
where testing was not done previously.
I have not all the information before me
in detail; but I remember either reading, or
being told by one of the federal officials, that
there were some 5,369 reactors the carcasses
of which, when slaughtered, were condemned
and sent to the tanks. As I explained previously, the only salvage the owners would
get on such animals would be the value of
the hides, an average of about $10 each.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They would not make
margarine out of those, would they?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
the meat of those animals is condemned as
unfit for consumption in any form.
I understand, that from April 1, 1947, to
September 30 of this year some 55,000 animals
have been destroyed following the tubercular
testing. Compensation has been paid in the
amount of approximately $2,050,000, which
is an average of about $38 per animal. In
addition, the owners of that stock-excepting
those who owned the 5,300 odd head which
went to the tanks-received the meat value
of the animals as canners or cutters, about
$60, plus the $38 to $40 paid by authority of
the Act. In other words, the owners of that
stock received an average of about $100 per
head.
Should further information be required, I
would suggest that after the bill receives
second reading it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
think it scarcely necessary to refer the bill
to committee. It is an important measure,
and I can understand, as has been explained
by the honourable senator for Kings, the
reasons for making certain payments retroactive to April 1, 1947. I agree with my
honourable friend that there have been a
great many reactors during the past two
years, and I look forward to the day when
al cattle in Canada will be tested for tuberculosis and Bang's disease. This procedure
is not only in the interest of the health of
animals, but also of the health of the people.
From my knowledge of the livestock industry, I entirely approve of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before this bill gets second
reading, I should like to ask one or two questions. Perhaps the answers could be delayed
until the committee meets.
45785-191

What astonishes me about the bill is the
change that has taken place in the amounts
allocated as compensation for the slaughtering of certain classes of animals. If you look
at the sections which are being repealed,
you will see that in the case of pure-bred
animals, the amount payable is reduced from
$300 to $200, for each horse, and from $150
to $100 for each head of cattle. There is
a change in the new section whereby purebred cattle are segregated from grade cattle;
but in my opinion the prices now offered are
wholly inadequate. For instance, take the
reduction from $150 per head to $100 in the
price to be paid to the farmer for pure cattle.
I know that in the province of British Columbia grade cows are selling just now at $250,
and purebreds at prices up to $500. While
under this section you propose to reduce from
$150 to $100 the amount payable to the farmer
for horses, you allow him $50 for a pure-bred
ram. In other words you are going to pay
him more than he could get on the open
market were he to sell that ram alive for
breeding purposes. As one who knows something of what he is speaking about, I would
like more information on the matter.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: As I said in trying to
explain this bill, there is no change in the
maximum compensation that can be paid by
the Department of Agriculture. Under legislation in force since 1923, the figures mentioned
by the honourable senator who has just taken
his seat are correct, namely $300 in the case
of pure-bred horses and $150 for grade
animals. But section 15 of the Act-which
is to be repealed-went further and provided
that the compensation was to be only twothirds of that maximum. The minister could
not pay any more. So on the basis of twothirds of these amounts-$300 and $150-we
arrive at the figures named in paragraphs (a)
to (d) of section 1 of the bill before us. There
is no change, by way of reduction, and there
has been none since 1923; in fact, this bill
will allow of small increases for swine and
sheep.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. As I understand the
bill, the owner of a reactor which is still fit
for beef, will get this compensation as well
as whatever price the animal brings on the
market.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McDonald moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND READING
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill D-6, an Act to amend the
Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. Rober±son: I have asked the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to look after this bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, except for
section 1, this is a simple bill, and its provisions are not of an important character.
Section 1, which I am sure will appeal to
all honourable senators, will have the effect
of decreasing to some extent the customs
duties leviable upon the importation of certain
commodities into Canada. It is designed in
particular to assist Great Britain to export
certain commodities more freely to this country, under circumstances which I shall outline
in a moment.
Section 1 of the bill amends section 35 of
the Customs Act by adding to it a new subsection which reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may order that import
duties of a country of export shall be disregarded,
in whole or in part, in estimating the value for
duty of goods of any kind imported into Canada
from a country specified in the order.

Honourable senators will see from reading
this subsection that it relates only to goods
which originate in one country, are exported
from that country to a second country, at
which time customs duties are imposed, and
are later exported from the second country
to Canada. The particular class of goods
which this legislation is designed to cover is
for the most part liquors.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did you say liquors?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
An Hon. Senator: This will be interesting.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am advised that West
Indies rum and Irish whiskey are imported
in large bulk quantities by England, that
they are aged and bottled in England, and
thereafter are exported to Canada. The
same is true of ports and sherries which are
exported, respectively, from Portugal and
Spain to England and of certain South African
and Australian wines which are imported
into England, bottled in that country, and
thereafter exported to Canada.
Under the present customs legislation, when
those commodities are imported into Canada
they are valued for customs duty and sales
tax by adding not only their original value
when imported into England, but also the
extremely high customs duties which England

imposes upon these importations. These duties
are very largely not customs duties at all, but
are really excise duties and luxury taxes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is it not also true that
these commodities are imported in bulk into
Canada, and are watered in Canada and
then sold?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
from Blaine Lake is a better expert on
watered stock than I am.
As a consequence of the practice I have
outlined, these commodities when imported
into Canada, are subject to custons duties
and sales tax based on the inflated value
resulting from the addition to the original
value of the large customs duties imposed
upon them in England. As I say, this in fact
is really a luxury tax.
The section provides that in cases of this
kind the Governor in Council, in fixing the
value of these commodities for import duty
and sales tax in Canada, may, by regulation,
disregard in whole or in part these so-called
customs duties that have been imposed on
another country. This will mean that it will
be easier for Great Britain to export more
of these commodities to Canada; there will
be less sales tax to pay on them when they
enter this country, and to that extent it will
help British exports to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is there any guarantee
that the price to the ultimate consumer in
Canada will be correspondingly reduced?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid that I
cannot give such a guarantee. What happens
of course is that when these commodities
enter Canada, after the Dominion has dealt
with them they fall into the hands of the
provinces and the provinces impose quite
substantial taxes upon them. Although the
customs duties and sales taxes imposed by
Canada will be reduced-if and when the
Governor in Council makes regulations
in accordance with this section-I am
afraid that I cannot give my honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) any
guarantee that there will be a reduction in
the price to the ultimate consumer in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: When these commodities come into Canada after passing
through Great Britain, do they bear the
designation of their country of origin?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They go first from their
country of origin to Great Britain, and after
processing or bottling there, they are exported
from Great Britain to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Do they preserve the
identity from their country of origin?

NOVEMBER 16, 1949
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not quite understand my honourable friend's question. They
are very often processed, bottled and matured
in England.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Do they then come
into this country as English goods?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, and the point is
that they have to be valued for customs and
sales tax purposes in this country on the
basis, not of their original value, but on their
original value plus the large excise taxes put
upon them in Great Britain when they are
taken into that country.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: How do we determine
the original value?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: This is established in
the same way as the customs duties. The
invoice will show what the original value
was.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Would this legislation
apply to raw material manufactured in England and exported to Canada? I have in mind
such commodities as textiles.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. It only applies to
goods imported into one country and exported
from that country to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Then that should apply
in the case of textiles imported into England,
manufactured there, and then exported to
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is true. It might
apply in that case, but I doubt whether the
Governor in Council would take advantage
of this section in the matter of textiles,
because they are not subject to the enormous
and excessive customs duties I have referred
to.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why do they not enumerate
the commodities to which this section will
apply?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suppose it is because
the circumstances may change from year to
year, and the class of commodity sought to
be covered by this legislation might vary
from time to time.
Honourable senators, this is the only section
of the bill which I think is of general interest.
The other sections are more or less matters
of mechanics. Two sections result from the
fact that the old Act refers to an Assistant
Commissioner of Customs, and that the position has been abolished. Section 4 of the bill
provides a simple means by which, in the case
of seizure by the Customs authorities, an innocent person who may have some interest in
the seized article, such as a motor car or a
ship, may present his claim before the courts
of the country.

Hon. John T. Haig: I want to thank the
honourable senator frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) for his splendid explanation of this
bill. I read the bill fully, but I did not
appreciate how far it goes.
Honourable senators, it is not a good principle in legislation, especially in tariff legislation, to give the government power by order
in council to reduce the tariff, unless the
items are set out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They have that power now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but why should we
continue a bad practice, especially in a case
like this, where there is such a wide difference of opinion? I am not sure that the
people of Canada are so anxious to help trade
with Great Britain that they will want to
do this thing. I can understand a desire on
the part of our people to increase trade with
Britain in commodities that are largely processed in that country, but I am not at all
sure that they are anxious to build up the
kind of trade which has been referred to.
A good deal of joking is done about the
commodity mentioned, but many people are
opposed to its use, and there is being spent
upon it a lot of money which in a year or
two we may wish we had not spent. It seems
to me it would have been better for the
government to have set out in the bill just
what it intended to do. It is not necessary
to have a cabinet committee to decide
whether liquor is to be admitted at lower
rates than at present-and what this bill
really amounts to is a reduction in the taxes
on the admission of liquor into this country.
I do not know whether the house wishes to
vote in favour of that kind of proposition or
not. I am speaking for nobody but myself,
and I feel that liquor is not one of those
commodities whose importation should be
increased. If we wish to increase our purchases from Britain, let us buy more goods
whose purchase price will be distributed
among people employed in manufacturing
industries over there.

I do not see why there should be a reduction in the Dominion Government's tax on
liquor, unless the present tax is abnormally
high. I think that as a matter of fact it is
abnormally high, and that the provinces also
make a very substantial profit on the business. The probable effect of this measure
will be to increase the provincial revenues
from liquor. The liquor commissioner in
Manitoba, who is a very honest man,
admitted that the province-as was pointed
out by my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)-dilutes its whisky
with water, and therefore has more to sell.
The minister was asked in the legislature at

SENATE
Winnipeg: "What are you going to do about

it?"
money."
I do not think the bill will increase Canadian business by one dollar, and in any
event I would not want to see any increase
in the liquor business. To speak candidly, I
personally would not be in favour of it.
People who buy liquor can afford to pay
for it, and it is a good source of revenue.
It is a much better thing to tax than personal enterprise and ability, upon which our
present taxation law bears so heavily.
I wish to make it clear that I am speaking,
not for my party at all, but for myself alone,
and that I am not very happy about the
proposed amendment. To be quite frank,
I am very unhappy about it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) if there is any particular reason
why rum should not be imported directly
from the West Indies instead of being routed
by way of the British Isles? I know that
sherry comes from England, because it is
blended there. Rum has to do with the
subject of West Indies trade, which we were
discussing a day or two ago, and I had
understood that Bacardi and certain other
brands came into this country direct from
the West Indies.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am unable to give a
definite reply to my honourable friend, but
I take it that Great Britain has had many
hundreds of years' experience in ageing and
bottling rum, and that a good deal of the
West Indies rum imported into this country
was first shipped to Britain to be processed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: A few years ago I
happened to be in Cuba, and I was told by
the Bacardi people there that the strength
of rum depends, not upon ageing, but upon
a process used in the manufacture. I may
be wrong in this, but my understanding is
that ageing is not necessary for rum, though
it may be for some other liquors.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Scotch whisky, for instance,
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to call
attention to another point. In the past Great
Britain's commercial supremacy was based
upon the purchase abroad of raw materials,
which were imported, processed, and then
shipped to other countries. That was done
under the old-time policy of free-trade. But
that policy was abolished. England went
back on the ancient principles of Cobden,
Bright and others, and imposed tariff taxes.
My honourable friend says that the commodities covered by this bill are, upon entry

into England, subjected to excise and other
taxes, including luxury taxes-to the point,
I presume, where the trade is being killed
by taxation. Now, as I understand it, we
are asked to reduce our taxes in order that
Britain may maintain hers. I am not at all
sure that a reduction in our federal taxes
on these commodities will be followed by an
increase in provincial taxes. Rather, this
reduction might permit Britain to maintainor even increase-taxes which otherwise
circumstances might compel her to decrease.
Quite aside from the commodities themselves, I do not know that I like the principle
involved in the bill. I am, of course, in
favour of reducing taxes, particularly tariff
taxes. I never did like them and I never
will.
Any reduction in tariff taxes is always
welcomed by me, but I do not like the reason
for this reduction.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Honourable senators, I
think Newfoundland has perhaps a unique
method of processing wines. English houses
that put up port wine ship it in pipes, as
they are called, from Oporto to Newfoundland, where the wine is aged for a period
of six months or a year. It is then reexported to England, to be bottled and sent
out under the respective firms' names, one
of which, Newman, is perhaps known to
everyone here. Rum also is aged, in wooden
casks, and the trip across the sea from the
West Indies to England would undoubtedly
have a beneficial effect upon it.
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I confess that I have no detailed
knowledge of the bill which has been
explained by my honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). Additional
information on points that have been brought
up might be obtained from the department.
The effect of the bill may be largely confined
to the items that my honourable friend mentioned, although I do not think the intention
was that it should be confined to these
exclusively. I suppose that the abnormally
high excise taxes imposed on goods imported
into Britain for export later would of necessity apply only to those that are to be processed, for otherwise they would no doubt
be allowed to remain in bond in order to
avoid the payment of any excise tax whatever upon them in Britain. Apart altogether
from the question of whether it is desirable
for people to consume more or less liquor,
the bill gives the Governor in Council authority to pass regulations under which there may
be fixed a much lower value for duty purposes than may be fixed under the present

NOVEMBER 16, 1949
law. Regardless of the individual item concerned, I think it is desirable to have a lower
value for duty purposes.
Otherwise we
create hidden tariff protections, such as the
United States employs, and about which we
are so critical. I am rather intrigued about
the amount of hidden tariff protection there
is in our own Canadian regulations, and I
should like to see the principle embodied in
this bill extended, for the sooner that is
done the better will be our economic
structure.
Whether the provisions of the bill would
apply to items other than liquors, as was suggested by the honourable senator from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud), I cannot say
definitely; but the point raised is a pertinent
one. Undoubtedly the bill would have the
effect of reducing tariffs on goods coming to
Canada from Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: I do not see that section
1 of the bill applies particularly to liquor.
It is a very general provision that we are
placing on our statute books, and although
I am sure that the present government will
apply it for the protection of our industries
and the labour employed in those industries,
I point out that this law will probably remain
on our statutes for a long time, and it might
be wise, therefore, to consider it further in
committee and make sure that it does not
apply to such industries as the textiles industry. We have already heard that the woollen
industry is very much perturbed about the
competition of British-made goods. In the
case of woollens, the raw material is imported
into England, manufactured there and
exported to this country, where it competes
with the product of a very prosperous industry. The same principle would apply to
cotton textiles. The British manufacturer
imports his raw materials from our neighbour
to the south, or from Brazil or Egypt. He
then manufactures cotton goods, which, if
exported to this country, might ruin a large
labour-employing industry in Canada.
I repeat that it may be wise to refer this
bill to a committee for further study.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, as
was explained so well by the senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), the purpose
of the legislation is to make it easier for the
British to export goods to Canada. The
ultimate purpose, I suppose, is to provide
Great Britain with more dollars.
The thought occurs to me that England
could lower the cost price of her raw materials
by reducing her import tariffs and excise
duties-if that is one factor which contributes
to the cost on which we charge so high a
duty-and the goods would then come to
Canada at a lower price. This would not

affect England's efforts to get more dollars.
That seems to me to be the logical way to
handle the problem.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The answer is that she
needs the money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If England would reduce
the costs on her side, instead of asking Canada
to lower its tariff, she would get just as many
Canadian dollars.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, this
is an important bill, and notwithstanding the
lucid explanation made by the honourable
senator for Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
I for my part should like to have more time
to study it. Copies of the bill have been
distributed to us only since we came into
the chamber this afternoon, and I think the
bill deserves more study.
I am not sure that I will speak on the bill,
but I now move the adjournment of the
debate so that I may consider it further.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Ross was agreed
to, and the debate was adjourned.
SURPLUS CROWN ASSETS BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill E-6, an Act to amend the
Surplus Crown Assets Act-(Hon. Senator Robertson).

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) to handle this bill.
Hon. J. G. Fogo moved the second reading
of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the Surplus
Crown Assets Act was passed in 1944 for
the purpose of providing machinery for the
disposal of surplus Crown property, and was
not limited to surplus war assets.
The
purpose of the bill now before us is to continue on a peacetime basis the arrangement
which originated under the 1944 statute for
the disposal of such property. It is intended
that the Act shall continue in operation in
order to provide for the disposition of Crown
assets as they become surplus. The amendments contained in this bill bring the Act
up to date for operational purposes, and
embody certain provisions which experience
has shown to be desirable.
Prior to World War II there was no single
agency of the government for the disposal of
excess property. Each department disposed
of its own. The government is now satisfied
that a separate agency for this purpose is
good business and in the public interest. The
agency must of course continue to do the
job of disposing of war surplus assets.

SENATE

ambiguous. At any rate, whatever doubt
there was about what constituted "surplus
Crown assets" has been cleared up, I think
by the proposed definition, whereby the term
is made to mean property which a department shall report as surplus to the minister.
So now the question of what is or is not a
surplus is a matter for the department concerned: it becomes a surplus and comes under
the operation of this Act only when the
department declares it to be so.
In clause 2 of the bill, which is a re-draft
of section 3 of the original act, there are
certain exceptions set out. The effect of the
amending bill, therefore, is to place all surplus Crown assets, other than those excepted
under the amending bill, in a position where
they will be dealt with by the disposal agency.
The other principal amendment, which is to
be found in clause 5, is to change the name of
the continuing body from "War Assets
Corporation" to "Crown Assets Disposal
Corporation".
Although all honourable senators have had.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Not Winnipeg?
The present Act created two bodies. One
was the Crown Assets Allocation Committee,
the function of which was to advise, first,
the minister, and second, the War Assets
Corporation, which was the actual selling
agency. The committee has functioned since
1944. It has dealt with the orderly reporting
of surpluses by government departments, the
reception and consideration of such reports,
and the making of specific recommendations
to the War Assets Corporation regarding the
disposal of property. The committee also has
settled certain procedures to be followed by
government departments in making reports
of surpluses, and has dealt with such reports
as I have mentioned, in most cases by transferring the property to the War Assets Corporation for disposal. Having regard to the
volume or quantity and the wide variety of
the property which became surplus at the
end of the war, it was thought desirable in
setting up the Crown Assets Allocation Committee to make it a representative body.
Consequently, pursuant to the original Act,
appointments were made to this committee
of representatives of labour, and agriculture
and of consumers or householders, as well

NOVEMBER 16, 1949

Hon. Mr. Fogo: No; I think only in the
places that I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The important places!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I notice that Montreal was
not mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Nor Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have no surplus assets
in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: At one time the chief place
of business was in Montreal. It was removed
to Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They got out as soon as
they could!
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Incidentally, this bill
changes the place of the company's head
office from Montreal to Ottawa.
I think there is only one other item in
which honourable senators may be interested,
and that is that the sales for the current fiscal
year are estimated to amount to $12 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does that money go into
current account?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I believe that the amount
realized from sales is turned over to the
Receiver-General and becomes part of current revenue.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And the $400 million
received for property already sold have gone
the same way?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I think so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Naturally. Why not? Where
else could the money go?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: To sum up: I submit that
the bill, as I have pointed out, is intended
to simplify the machinery and to continue an
agency which experience has shown to be
useful and efficient for the purpose for which
it was designed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wonder whether my
honourable friend is sure that all the money
which has accrued from sales of assets bas
gone into current account? I very much doubt
it. The War Assets Corporation has been selling all kinds of things-commodities, and as
bas been pointed out, lands in British Columbia and elsewhere. Surely the proceeds of
land sales go into capital account.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it has all gone into the
current account.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
we have had quite a clear explanation of this
bill, but I presume that it will be sent to
committee for further study. It seems to me
that it is important to scrutinize the powers
that may be granted to those who will
administer this legislation.
45785-20

Section 7 of the bill provides:
Section 12 of this Act is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
(1) The minister may authorize the corporation
to exercise or perform any or all of the functions,
powers or duties of the minister under section five.

That is not of particular importance, but
subsection 2 reads:
(2) Subject to specifie or general instructions of
the minister, the corporation may
(a) convert surplus Crown assets to basic materiaIs;

Does this mean, for instance, that the corporation could set up a factory of some kind
to process or do something with assets that
may be transferred to it?
Then paragraph (b) reads:
(b) purchase, lease or otherwise acquire real or
personal prcperty for the purpose of its operations
and sell, lease or otherwise dispose of such property;

What is the significance of the corporation
being given power to "purchase, lease or
otherwise acquire real or personal property"?
Under the powers of government are we proposing to establish a new processing or manufacturing company?
Then paragraph (c) reads:
do such other acts and things as the board may
deem incidental or conducive to the attainment of
its objects or the exercise of its powers.

Honourable senators, I am not opposing the
measure, but I suggest that we should obtain
further information on these points when the
bill is before committee. It seems to me
that we are creating quite a number of Crown
companies of one kind and another. Usually,
when such companies are created, the intention is that they shall perform a specific duty
and then pass out of existence. These companies are really designed to meet emergency
conditions, but we must be on guard against
placing them on such a basis that they will
be with us permanently.
Government today is an extraordinarily
complex business. It is so complex that it is
getting beyond the grasp of the ordinary
citizen, and I am old-fashioned enough to
believe that one of the prime needs in carrying on a democratic government is to keep
legislation in as simple a form as possible.
I am not criticizing this measure, but I think
we should be given a full explanation when
it goes to committee.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I agree with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that this is an
important bill. Personally I do not feel we
have enough information before us to pass the
bill at this time. Honourable senators will
recall that at the conclusion of World War II
the War Assets Corporation was set up to
dispose of the hundreds of millions of dollars

SENATE

worth of property which Canada had bought
and acquired during the war. When the War
Assets Corporation was established, it was
looked upon as a temporary board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Its purpose was to dispose
of this property, and then it was to be dissolved. However, it looks as though the War
Assets Corporation, like many other government boards, is going to be perpetuated.
From a brief reading of the bill I take it
that this corporation will dispose not only of
property left over from the war, but of all
surplus property from other government
departments. Up to the present time I believe
the various government departments, by
auction or otherwise, have disposed of their
own property; but as I see it, we are now
going to delegate certain authority to a single
government agency, and this agency will be
perpetuated. I for one am frank to say that
I have not enough information to agree to the
passing of this legislation now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo)
whether all the money obtained during the
existence of this corporation has gone into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund? As I understand it, during the war money was borrowed
on bonds, to purchase goods and assets. When
the war was over these assets were sold and
the money was put into the current account
instead of being used to pay off the bonds.
The government claims to have paid off a
national debt of a billion and a quarter dollars, but this four hundred and eighty odd
million dollars was part of that money. Am
I right or wrong?
Hon. Mr. Fogo:

I think

the honourable

leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is
quite right. Honourable senators will find
that section 15 of the original Act provides
for periodic payments of the money by this
agent to the Minister of Finance. When
moneys were borrowed during the war, they
were not borrowed against the purchase of
particular items of war equipment. War
equipment was purchased out of appropriations which, in turn, came out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Like the honourable
leader opposite, I have been told that the
moneys received from the sale of war assets
have been applied against the general debt of
the country.
In reply to the remarks of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
respecting the powers of the company, I
would say that the amending bill reduces
rather than enlarges those powers. If you
compare the new powers with the previous

ones, I think you will find they are actually
not as great as they were before. This is
largely because the company, presumably,
will not have as broad a task in future as it
had in the past. As stated by the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), and as I think I made clear, there is
no doubt that it is intended to carry on the
agency, which has been found satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is Mr. Taylor still the
general manager of the corporation?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: No. I do not think he ever
was.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I may have made a mistake
in the name. Who is the general manager?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The general manager is Mr.
H. R. Malley, who is also the vice-president.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Mr. Berry is the man
whom the leader of the opposition has in
mind.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The president of the company during, I think, most of the period from
1944 to 1947 was John Berry.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the man.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: He now occupies a senior
position with the A. V. Roe Company. During
the war he was Chairman of the War Production Board, and after the war be was
prevailed upon to stay on and act as president
of this corporation for a time. The present
secretary of the corporation is R. P. Saunders,
K.C. In addition to Mr. Malley and Mr.
Saunders, the directors are: W. D. Low, Managing Director of the Canadian Commercial
Corporation, Major General J. H. MacQueen,
President of Canadian Arsenals Limited, and
E. R. Birchard, Vice-President of the National
Research Council. Al these senior officiais
of the company are in Ottawa.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,

speaking as a Canadian, I think that throughout Mr. Berry's period of office, up to the
end of 1947, the corporation was extremely
well administered. I am not familiar with
its operations since then. I agree with the
honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and the honourable gentleman
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that
it is a dangerous thing to authorize the government to branch out into business, and I
believe we should do everything possible
within reason to wind up this sort of thing.
In saying this I am not criticizing the government, nor, I think, were the honourable
gentlemen whom I have mentioned.
I can understand, of course, that the government may have so many surplus assets

NOVEMBER 1.
that no regular department is equipped to
handle them. My point is that we should be
on the alert to prevent participation by the
government in competitive business. I know
that in Canada a large body of thought is
against me on this. Well, the government
of another country has been engaging in
various lines of business during the last four
and a half years, and it is still trying to
take on more. Whether the people of that
country will support their government at the
general election next year I cannot say, and
in any event that is none of my business,
but I am sure that the majority of Canadians do not want to see our government
entering upon more commercial undertakings.
It seems to me quite clear that the sentiment of this country, as expressed in the
general elections last June, was very largely
in favour of a reduction in the government's
business activities. In my province of Manitoba, also, where we recently had a general
election-I am not talking politics now, for
the parties are rather badly mixed up there
-the sentiment was pretty clearly against
the participation of the government in ordinary business.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The people of New York
State did not vote that way the other day.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They will always vote in
favour of being given something for nothing
by the government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: People might do that
here too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and I am not saying
that children's allowances and other payinents by the government did not affect the
result in our last federal election. What I
am saying is that our people are not in
favour of the government entering into any
further lines of business.
It would probably be well to have this
bill sent to a committee, and I think the
minister should be there to tell us what the
government's policy is.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: May I say just one word?
I think the real question here is whether or
not we wish to have surplus assets sold by
eighteen departments or by one.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Fogo moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Roebuck, that the government be requested
to submit to the forthcoming DominionProvincial Conference on the constitution a
draft amendment to the British North
America Act.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
first of all I wish to express sincere gratitude
to the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for the time and
thought he has given to the matter we are
now considering. For two sessions it was
my privilege to preside over the Joint Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms. At all sittings of the committee
our distinguished colleague from TorontoTrinity played an active part and showed a
keen interest in the work. Other active and
keenly interested members of the committee
were the honourable senator from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) and the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis).
Yesterday each of them made an illuminating
contribution to the subject under discussion,
and I feel that they deserve our heartiest
congratulations.
I am aware of the sincerity of all our colleagues who have preceded me in this debate
and so eloquently advocated the principles
of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
and I wish to assure the bouse that I am
as anxious as they are to serve the same
sacred cause. In particular I wish to assure
our distinguished colleague from TorontoTrinity that I believe just as much as he does
in freedom-freedom of conscience, freedom
of speech and freedom of association. Like
him, I think, as he said in his speech last
Thursday-I quote from page 217 of the
Senate Hansard-"that Canada today is the
freest nation upon the earth, and in that I
do not except either the United States or
Great Britain."
As stated in the report which I tabled in
this bouse on June 26, 1948, I believe that
the ultimate and effective safeguard of our
rights and freedoms lies in a resolute and
effective public opinion. Indeed, we should
never take for granted that our liberty is
out of danger. It remains forever true that
eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
I find an example of such vigilance in the
draft bill of rights so carefully prepared by
the members of the committee which has,
for its president, the very favourably known

SENATE
editor of Saturday Night, Mr. B. K. Sandwell,
and for its secretary, my learned confrere
Mr. Irving Himel. This committee deserves
our congratulations and our thanks. Its members have contributed in a practical way to
educate the public at large in this vital
matter of human rights. The text submitted
to us fully deserves our attention, and,
because it comes to us only as a basis of discussion, it invites our friendly criticism. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) took the proper attitude
when, as appears at page 216 of the Senate
Hansard, he admitted quite frankly in his
address "the difficulty inherent in the federal
system of divided jurisdiction", and conceded-that no truly comprehensive bill of rights, applicable under all circumstances, could be enacted by
the Dominion Parliament alone without infringing
the provincial jurisdiction.

I come now to another point. When seconding this motion, the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) referred quite rightly to our partly unwritten
and rather flexible constitution. He stated
quite justly, as will be found at page 218 of
Senate Hansard, that we in Canada possess
freedoms which people with a rather rigid
constitution do not have. Our honourable
colleague showed a strong sense of loyalty
when he expressed the following doubt:
If Canadians are the freest people in the world,
we would be surrendering something by adopting
all the articles of this resolution. By adopting a
bill of rights specifically defining our freedoms, we
might be restricting rather than advancing the
objectives we have in view.

The seconder of the motion quoted, as
appears on page 218 of the Senate Hansard,
a passage extract from Dr. Ollivier, Law
Clerk of the other place, in which, after
referring to various organic statutes which
forrn our constitution, he says:

subject-matters. I have given this a good deal of
consideration and my submission is the outcome of
the consideration.

Finally, Dean Kennedy states:
I do not believe that a bill of rights is really
necessary. I think that 'freedoms" are well enough
protected in the ordinary law and, if this is not so,
it cught to be possible to change the law in the
various jurisdictions to suit occasions. I would also
like to submit that a bill of rights must, by its very
nature, be drawn up in terms which are flot terras
of art. As s consequence. there would be interminable litigation and the interpretation of the terms
would vary in a different manner with the changes
of the judiciary.
This is the experience of the
United States.

In 1947, as you remember, the Clerk of our
Joint Cornmittee wrote to ail the attorneys
general of the provinces, and to ail heads
of our law sehools, asking for their views
on the question of the power of the Parliament of Canada to enact a comprehensive
bill of rights applicable to ail Canada. In
addition to the letter just referred to from
Dean Kennedy, answers were received f romn
other law faculties and f rom various
attorneys general. Saskatchewan, however,
was the only province to favour a federal
bill of rights and to offer "'to co-operate in
the working out of any jurisdîctional problems that may arise." It must be noted that
in 1947 the Saskatchewan Legisiature unanirnously passed a bill of rights, which is
entitled "The Saskatchewan Bill of Rights
Act, 1947", and is chapter 35 of the Saskatchewan statutes of that year. But, to sumn
up, none of the attorneys general and none
of the deans of the law schools conceded to
our parliament the power to enact a comprehensive bill of rights applicable to al
Canada. Except the Attorney General of
Saskatchewan, none favoured the adoption
of a federal bill of rights.
Our Joint Committee received also written
representations from several groups and
organizations. But only a few of the brief s
submitted recornmended a bill of rights for
Canada. Under these circumstances, I believe
that we were quite justified in reporting to
this house on June 25, 1948, that it would be
undesirable to undertake to define the rights
in question "before a firm. public opinion has
been formed as to their nature. It was flot
evident to our committee that suceh an
opinion had reached an advanced state in
Canada. We insisted on the need for more
public discussions."
I welcorne therefore the opportunity which
our senator from Toronto-Trinity affords to
us to continue here our efforts for a better
understanhing of this very important matter.
I amn anxious to offer sorne constructive suggestions; but I insist before ail, that at the
present tirne our parliament should limit itself
to purely federal matters. Secondly, 1 think

that we should try to begin to agree on a
few basic principles clearly within our federal
sphere of jurisdîction and clearly acceptable
to the great majortiy of the Canadian people.
Once we have accomplished this first task, our
next step would be, I think, to embody such
principles in a short and concise declaration
of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
After that, but only after that, because we
should let time do its work, experience would
tell us if anything more should be done by us.
At ail events, we may hope that, if we adopted
such a declaration of human rights, some provincial legislatures would follow our example
and pass similar declarations.
I have already referred to the statute
adopted by the Legislature of Saskatchewan;
and without taking much more of your time,
I wish to make a f ew remarks concerning
the preamble and the main subject-matters
to be embodied in the text of the draft deciaration to which I have referred. Thus I shail
be able to indicate to our senator from
Toronto-Trinity and his friends to what distance 1 may be able to follow them at a latei
date, though now I cannot vote in favour
of the motion which is before us.
Originally the Toronto Committee for a
Bill of Rights submitted to the Joint Committee of our two houses the draft of a bill by
wbich the Imperial Parliament would prohîbit the Parliament of Canada and also our
provincial legislatures from, makinýg any laws
violating human rights. Thus "to take away
fromn parliament its sovereign power and to
return it to the source from. which it came,
namely the United Kingdom Parliarnent"',
was described by the Deputy Minister of
Justice,' Mr. Varcoe, as a "retrograde step".
The reading of the very îlluminating evidence
given before us by Mr. Varcoe should satisfy
anyone, I think, on this point. You wiil find
bis views recorded in the proceedings of our
Joint Committee of 1947, at page 84, and of
1947-48, at page 202. If I may refer to myself,
honourable senators, and cite page 180 of our
proceedings in 1947-48, you will find that
I was then opposed, as I arn today, to the
surrender of any part of our sovereignty to
Westminster. I arn convinced also that none
of our provinces would consent to such a
reactionary gesture. Until a new system is
set up in Canada for constitutional amendments in provincial matters, such a motion as
that which is now before us would require
the intervention of the Imperial authority in
order to limit the now absolute jurisdiction
which the provinces enjoy concerning property and civil rights. It would be a great
error, in the pretended name of human rights,
to give the impression to any provincial
government that we on parliament bill are

SENATE
trying to impose upon them our own conception of what is right or wrong. Let us
put our own house in order, and such a
course will have much greater force of
persuasion.
I therefore take it for granted that we limit
ourselves to purely federal matters in our
discussion of a declaration of human rights.
I advocate, as a first step, a declaration, not a
bill, because before legislating we must first
agree on some fundamental principles. I
trust that the majority of Canadians would
be able to agree on such a declaration, but
I fear that conflicting views may prevent, or
at least considerably delay, the adoption of
a bill of rights. There may even be bitter
discussions as to the proper procedure to be
followed for the enactment of such a measure,
either as an ordinary statute or as an organic
law. The question of the suspension of some
of the provisions of such an Act in case of
emergency would also arise. If we want to
achieve anything practical within a reasonable time, I am convinced that the consideration of a draft declaration of rights would be
the first step to take. But what subjectmatters should be embodied in such a declaration? We should proclaim the right to freedom of conscience, the right to personal freedom and security, the right to freedom from
arbitrary imprisonment and to a fair trial, the
right to free expression and to free association. We should proclaim the equality of all
before the law. We should also declare that
everyone has an equal right of access to
public service in our country. Finally, we
should add that all human rights and fundamental freedoms belong to every person without distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religious belief or political opinion.
Honourable senators, this is neither the
proper time nor place to discuss in detail such
a draft declaration. I must, however, tax your
patience a little more with the following comments. Such a declaration of rights should
clearly state that it applies only to all matters within the jurisdiction of the Canadian
Parliament. It should also be an act of faith,
and in a form acceptable to all good Canadians. It would be a grave error to insist on
human rights without referring either to corresponding duties, or to the Divine Source of
all rights. Without such references we would
leave to the generations to come, a very uninspiring document-only a dead letter on our
statute books.
In the immortal Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, the representatives of the thirteen American states
unanimously declared:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that al

1nen

are created equal, that they are endowed by

their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.

Honourable senators, I regret that the
Eternal Source of all rights is not mentioned
at the beginning of section 148, which the
motion before us seeks to add to our present
constitution. The proposed section 148 states
in its two first lines that:
Every person is entitled to the human rights and
fundamental freedoms herein set forth.

Then it sets out the 18 articles. Personally I
am firmly convinced that every individual is
entitled to certain unalienable rights, and I
am convinced that it is so because we are
endowed with such rights by the Creator of
all things and all living beings.
To conclude, may I quote one of the
founders of the great neighbouring republic,
and may I say with Benjamin Franklin:
I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I
live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth:
That God governs in the affairs of men. And if a
sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His
notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the
sacred writings, that "Except the Lord build the
house, they labour in vain that build it."

Honourable senators, without the assistance
of heaven, we shall succeed no better than
the builders of Babel in trying to build any
declaration or bill of rights. Any political
structure must have for its foundation the
living principles of eternal truth and eternal
justice.

The charter of the United Nations

has excluded the holy name of God from all
its provisions. But surely we Canadians,
as God fearing people, proud of our great
religious traditions, are anxious in our
national life to recognize the place of honour
which is due to the God of our fathers.
I hope that one day we will be able to
agree on a great historie text proclaiming
our faith in human rights and in universal
brotherhood, but proclaiming also in clear
and unambiguous words, our faith in God
Almighty, the Author of all rights. We
must never forget the religious origins of our
country.
It is great to be a Canadian,
because we have inherited the moral code
of our pioneers and because we have kept
their faith. It is our duty to render unto
God what is due to God, and always to
remember that we are all the children of
the same Creator, that we are the sons and
daughters of the same Father. Such great
truths we must briefly but sincerely inscribe
in the creed of freedom which it is our
mission to bequeath as our last will to those
who will come after us.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid the debate
was adjourned.

NOVEMBER 16, 1949
TRADE WITH THE WEST INDIES
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from Monday, November 14, the adjourned debate on the inquiry
of Hon. Mr. Kinley respecting trade between
Canada and the West Indies.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
the West Indies are right at the door of the
Maritime Provinces.
They stretch from
Bermuda right down to British Guiana and
British Honduras. They contain such great
islands as Jamaica, Trinidad, Antigua and
many other important parts of the empire.
Their production is complementary to
Canada's. In fact, I see no reason why we
should not welcome them as the eleventh
province, or at least have economic union
with them.
Trade between the Maritime Provinces and
the West Indies started upwards of 200 years
ago, when our forefathers left our Maritime
shores in sailing ships and went down to
the West Indies to trade, taking with them
lish, lumber and other Canadian products.
The goods were unloaded on the wharves
of the islands and the question asked in those
bygone days was: "How much rum, molasses,
sugar, fruits, etc. do we get?" A deal was
made. A few British pounds may have
changed hands, but a deal was made, anyway
and the Maritime Provinces were enriched
by importations from the West Indies, and
the West Indies were enriched by their receipt
of Canadian commodities. Since those early
days, over the years that have passed, a very
large import and export trade bas been
pioneered and built up between the West
Indies and this country. This bas meant a
heavy investment of Canadian capital. Many
ships have been built by Canadians to take
care of this trade, and the Canadian Government has granted large subsidies to promote
the trade. Thousands and thousands of our
Maritime people have become dependent for
their living on the West Indies trade.
During the war, and directly after, when
goods were scarce and money was plentiful,
we denied ourselves and made considerable
sacrifice in order to send real wealth to the
West Indies, in the form of food, clothing
and shelter, at fair prices. Naturally the
trade was one-sided: from a monetary standpoint it was in our favour. However, in the
last couple of years goods have become more
plentiful in the West Indies and we have
certainly done our part in buying any surplus
they had, as the figures will show. But there
seems to be little use in providing them with
extra dollars if those dollars are taken elsewhere and are not allowed to be spent with
us. Our pay-off is a steady loss of trade, as
indicated by the following figures.

In the year 1947 our exports to the West
Indies totalled $81 million, but in 1948 they
dropped to $58 million. Imports from the
islands over that period went up $9 million,
so we certainly did our part in trying to
increase trade with them. For the six months
of 1949-these are the only figures so far
obtainable for the present year-our exports
to the West Indies fell to $23 million, as
against imports of $26 million. And let me
point out that these figures include only the
visible trade, and take no account of the
tourist business, which runs into many
millions. It is clear that our business with
the West Indies has been reduced by more
than half.
During the last two or three years these
islands have been obliged to follow seemingly
dictatorial instructions from England as to
what nations they would trade with, and
on these instructions trade has steadily been
diverted away from Canada to other countries, whether they belong to the commonwealth or not. Even the dollars we have sent
to the islands to pay for sugar and bauxite
ore, from which aluminium is made, have
been diverted away from Canada. I have
seen lists issued on instructions from London
giving the names of countries that the West
Indies must trade with, and Canada has been
at the bottom of the lists. Today in the Maritime Provinces we wake up to find that
although we have made a very large investment in the West Indies, that investment is
to a great extent lying idle. Ships are tied
up to the wharves instead of moving goods
between the two countries. Subsidies have
been paid in vain. Those who have spent
their lives pioneering West Indies trade are
being denied a livelihood.
The diversion of the West Indies trade in
such circumstances might well be considered
a rather unfriendly act. Take the development of power in this country. Years ago,
when power was first developed in New
Brunswick and in other parts of Canada, we
began to export it across the border. At that
time our manufacturing enterprises were
rather few and far between, and therefore
we were glad to sell power in the United
States. In later years we expanded our own
manufacturing plants and needed hydro
power. But when we tried to get back for
Canadian industries the power that we were
shipping across the line, we found that the
Americans had invested a large amount of
capital in building up United States industries
dependent on this Canadian power; and we
were told that if we withdrew the power, and
those American industries were thereby
forced into idleness, it would be considered
an unfriendly act. So the power still is being
exported across the border. Now it is said

SENATE
that all the nations within the commonwealth
are on an equal basis. If so, Canada should
surely have certain empire trade rights. We
have a large capital investment in the West
Indies trade, and the diversion of that trade
away from us by other nations in the British
Empire or Commonwealth does not seem fair.
In other words, it does not seem to be a very
friendly act, for the trade in which we have
this large investment has a history of over
two hundred years.
It seems to me that strong representations
should be made to the government in England
that the West Indies trade is to a large extent,
the bread and butter of the Maritime Provinces, and that we in this country should be
consulted and given some consideration before
seemingly dictatorial demands are made on
the West Indies to divert their trade into
channels away from Canada. I do not know
whether we have been requested or not to
extend aid to our close neighbours of the
West Indies; but if we were, there is certainly
no reason why we should not extend temporary aid.
We all remember what President Roosevelt
said at a time when there was a great crisis
in the democratic world. He said that if your
neighbour's house is on fire you should give
him everything you have by way of protection-engines, fire hoses, water supply, etc.
-without any charge, because it may not be
long until you yourself will reach a crisis and
need the aid of your neighbour to conserve
your life and property.
Surely ways and means can be found to
hold this trade. Once a market is lost, its
recovery is very difficult and expensive. The
West Indies are today paying high prices in
other markets for commodities that could
easily be supplied by Canada on a far more
economical basis.
Of all the markets in the Empire, the West
Indies is the oldest and most logical one for
Canada to carry on with; but if the loss of
trade continues at the present rate we shall
be pretty well out of that market in a year
or so. This is not fair to the people of the
Maritime Provinces, who have pioneered and
worked so hard over the years to establish the
trade.
During the last year or two we have greatly
increased our buying in the West Indies.
But what is the use of this if our dollars are
diverted elsewhere and are not allowed to be
spent here? The people of the West Indies
are not even told of their dollar allocation by
the British Government. Many of them think
that a knowledge of where they stood would
be an incentive to them to try to sell more
in the dollar countries. They are being told
that Canada has large reserves of oil and that

it is very unlikely that they could sell more
oil or sugar up here. Their initiative and
ambition to trade more with Canada are certainly taken away when they do not know
where they stand as to Canadian dollars. If
they do earn more dollars, they have no
assurance that they will be allowed to spend
them here, where prices are lower than in
most countries from whom they are now
being directed to buy. The figures I quoted
tell a sad story of a steady loss of valuable
trade for Canada. They also represent a
great loss for the West Indies, for if ever a
trade was mutually profitable it was our
West Indies trade. As previously stated, the
commodities produced in our respective
countries are all complementary to one
another-our goods raised their standard of
living and their goods did the same for us.
It must be remembered that the figures I have
given cover only visible exports and imports,
and do not account for what has been spent
through the tourist trade.
The West Indies gain millions of dollars
from Canada in the tourist trade. Since the
austerity program came into force thousands
of Canadian tourists, who previously went to
the United States, visit the West Indies and
spend a lot of money there. What has become
of all these dollars that are being diverted
away from Canada?
I have before me a newspaper from Trinidad containing a verbatim report of an
address before the Chamber of Commerce
there by Mr. Arthur Shenfield, their cconomic
adviser, who came from outside the countryI presume the United Kingdom. We have
heard of these economic advisers many times
before. I will lay the speech on the table,
but I should like to refer to one or two bits
of advice which Mr. Shenfield gives as to
what Canada will or will not do. Mr. Shenfield has never been up here, so far as I know,
and I do not think he should advise these
people about Canada without making a firsthand investigation. In effect, Mr. Shenfield
says that Canada has a big reserve of oil,
and would not buy any more of that product;
also he says that we have all the sugar we
want, and that it is useless for the West
Indies to try to stimulate trade with us in
Though he speaks with

great authority and tells the traders of the
West Indies what they can and cannot do,
I have never heard of him. When asked how
many Canadian dollars were coming into the
West Indies, Mr. Shenfield refused to answer
and said that these matters were decided in
high places.
Honourable senators, because of the conditions of world trade, and particularly
because many people in the Maritime

NOVEMBER 16, 1949
Provinces depend on trade for their livelihood, every effort should be made by the
government to see that something is done to
stimulate our activities in this field. We
could at least see that the people of the
West Indies get accurate information, which
they do not seern to be getting from their
economic adviser.

SURPLUS CROWN ASSETS BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. T. A. Crerar, Acting Chairman of the

Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented and moved concurrence in
the report of the committee on Bill E-6, an
Act to amend the Surplus Crown Assets Act.
(The report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
as follows:)
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred Bill E-6, an Act to
amend the Surplus Crown Assets Act, have in
obedience to the order of reference of November
16, 1949, examined the said bill and now beg leave
to report the same without any amendment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
shall not delay the house for more than a
moment or two. The basis of this bill is the
continued delegation of government powers
to a Crown corporation. In committee we
discussed
the 'question of governmental
responsibility. It is true that the corporation
reports to the Minister of Trade and Commerce-a fact which may be said to establish
some connection with the government-and
that the corporation is provided for in the
estimates of his department; but it charges
10 per cent commission on the goods it sells,
and has the disposal of the proceeds.
If
there is any surplus on operations, no doubt
the money goes to the government, but the
fact remains that the corporation is controlled by its directors.
I am opposed to a policy of that kind; I
object to any system that delegates the
responsibility of the government or of parliament to a corporation, by whatever name
that corporation is called. It is a very, very
dangerous practice. I admit that it may be
permitted under special circumstances, when
times are good and money is plentiful. But
I predict, even though I may be accused of
saying it too often, that the storm signals
are out and there will be a different story
to tell when the estimates of 1951 come
before us. Parliament is losing control of
the nation's purse-strings when it allows
goods to be sold by a private corporationbecause that is what it amounts to-which
can recover its expenses from the 10 per cent
that it charges, and turn over the rest to the
government.

I also am opposed to making this corporation permanent. I made no objection to the
establishment of the corporation after the
war for the purpose of disposing of war
assets. I may have had something to say

by way of criticism of those assets, as being
too great or too small, but that issue is past

and gone and there is no point in reviving
it. Some may argue that it is advantageous to have the surplus assets in every
department turned over to this corporation.
But that has nothing to do with the principle
whereby the government of the country is
transferring control to a government corpor-

ation, and whereby the only restraint which
parliament can exercise is through the
minister, upon the consideration of his estimates.
I admit that a discussion can take
place at that time, but any control that may
be exercisable over the expenditures of the
department is confined, of course, to the
minister himself.
Another point of criticism is that certain
businesses are exempted from the provisions
of the bill, and that some procedures under
the Act are subject to order in council-both
of which are bad principles. All such exceptions should come before this house, or the
other, and be dealt with by parliament itself.
Probably a majority will vote for the continuation of these powers.
Nevertheless I
do not believe they should be extended, and
on behalf of those associated with me, as well
as myself, I protest against this delegation
of governmental powers to a Crown corporation.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,

Mr. Ross) has requested me to inform the

dispense with any suspicion that any member

of this house is opposed to the principles or
ideals outlined in the resolution. I feel that
every one of us is entirely in accord with
the intent of its various articles; it is when
we examine what is being actually requested
that differences of opinion arise.
The different opinion to which I hold
may be termed threefold. My first objection
to the resolution is that it is premature.
The commission on human rights and fundamental freedoms was established by the
United Nations in 1946, and it was not until
two and a half years later-that is, some
time in 1948-that the commission's declarations on human rights were enunciated in
the form of the articles now before us. But

SENATE

I may point out that at the time they were
enunciated it was not intended that they
should be implemented right away. The
articles are really a declaration of faith
embodying what it is proposed that the
members of the United Nations should place
before themselves as ideals. It was not considered probable that the articles in their
present form would be implemented. If you
will look up the records of the United Nations
you will find that the General Assembly is
planning to present, in September 1950, a
Bill of Rights drafted in more precise terms
and in a form which will be acceptable to all
member nations for implementation. So I
say to the honourable gentleman who introduced the resolution, and to the house, that
were we to request the government to submit
the present articles to the forthcoming
Dominion-Provincial Conference, our action
would be premature, for no one can predict
now just what form will be taken by the
articles to be presented by the General
Assembly in 1950.
I have a further objection. As I say, I am
attempting to deal with the matter practically.
To my mind, if there is anything that would
likely break up the Dominion-Provincial
Conference, it is just such a set of clauses
as we have before us here. To my mind, the
failure of the dominion and provincial
governments to come to an understanding in
1945 and 1946 was caused by the fact that too
many matters were placed on the table for
consideration by the premiers of the then
nine provinces. If you will look back at
what has taken place in Canada since that
time, including the legislation that we have
passed, you will observe that in the meantime we have learned a lesson or two. For
example, under the British North America
Act public health is a matter within the
legislative powers of the various provinces;
yet they agreed to co-operate in the National
Health Scheme which is now being carried
out by the federal government. How did
the federal government get the provinces to
agree to that? Well, the provinces were
consulted, one by one, and only one matter
was discussed at a time. I feel sure that
if the present resolution were placed before
the forthcoming conference it would cause
a wider breach between the federal and provincial governments than now exists. This
is aside from my further point that the conference is not being called to deal with
extraneous matters, however idealistic and
necessary they may be, but with amendments to the British North America Act.
I have placed before the house what I
regard as two serious objections to our

adoption at this time of a resolution calling
for the placing of these articles before the
Dominion-Provincial
Conference.
I also
submit to honourable senators that a brief
consideration of the articles will cause thern
to realize the difficulties which were faced
by the Commission on Human Rights in their
attempt to draft an acceptable declaration.
I believe there is scarcely a single one o
the articles which would not keep this
chamber or any other Canadian legislative
body engaged in discussion, contentious or
not, for a considerable period of time. Let
me call attention to the wording of one or
two articles. For instance, article 3 says:
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishnent.

Now I say, in no sense of levity, that I would
not have to go far to find people who would
say they are subjected to cruel treatment
when I play the Scottish national instrument.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Seriously, I should not like
to see the Senate approve of a clause like
that, unless it was elaborated and made
clearer.
Article 4 says:
Everyone has the right to recognition throughout

Canada as a person before the law.

I listened attentively to the splendid speech
made a day or so ago by the honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis),
who reminded us that it is not so long since
women were first recognized as "persons"
eligible for appointment to the Senate. But
I do not think the honourable lady or any
other senator would deny that in this country
everyone, whether male or female, is recognized as a person before the law.
I run along to article 15, which begins by
saying:
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought

Now, just how would you go about preventing

a

person

from thinking

what he

wished? For example, I might have some
thoughts unfavourable to a certain person,
but how would he know it? And if he did
know it, how could he prevent me from
having the thoughts? The article goes on to
say that everyone has the right to freedom
of conscience. Well, how can you control
a person's conscience? It simply cannot be
done. You can control the expression of a
man's thoughts by putting him in jail or, as
they do in Soviet Russia, by shooting him;
but by no manner of means can you control
a person's thoughts or conscience, for we
have not yet discovered how to read what is
in the human mind or conscience.

NOVEMBER 17. 1949
Then, article 17:
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful
assembly and association.

Well, as we know, what constitutes a peaceful assembly is a question of opinion. I have
seen, as perhaps other senators have, someone
preaching a doctrine of religion at a street
corner, and have heard people to whom the
doctrine was disagreeable claim that the
an unlawful
preacher was conducting
assembly. Incidents of that kind do occur
in this country of ours.
In commenting upon these few articles I am
simply trying to show that not only would it
be difficult to put the proposed bill of rights
into effect, but also that an attempt to do so
at this time might have an injurious effect in
other countries. Some people abroad are
closely watching what is going on in Canada.

I wonder if the sponsor of this resolution
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) would be prepared to take
action against trade unions in this country,
or even against lawyers' associations or medical societies, for infraction of this clause.
Does anyone believe that there is in this
country a government which would endeavour
to enforce such a clause? As we all know,
bar associations and medical societies have
power to prevent anyone other than their
members from practising as lawyers and
doctors. And many trade unions have closed
shops, in which persons who do not belong
to the unions are forbidden to work. By
trying to put these freedoms into words,
sentences and paragraphs, I very much fear
that we may inadvertently leave out some
of the rights and freedoms which each and
everyone of us enjoy.
I would draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that by bringing this matter
before the house the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has carried out the request of the United Nations,
which appears at page 255 of Canada and the
United Nations 1948, and reads as follows:
Recomends Governments of Member States to
show their adherence to Article 56 of the Charter
by using every means within their power solemnly
to publicize the text of the declaration and to cause
it to be disseminated, displayed. read and expounded, principally in schools-

-and other educational institutions, without distinction based on the political status of countries
or territories.

As I say, I sincerely believe that the
honourable senator has carried out that
recommendation, but in view of the fact that
the subject is premature and that the United
Nations will not consider the eighteen articles
in precise terns until September 1950, and
that it is not practical to throw the matter
into the lap of the coming Dominion-Provincial Conference, I suggest that the honourable senator withdraw his resolution.

On the order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the inquiry
of the Honourable Senator Kinley that he will cali
the attention of the Senate to the restricted state
of trade between Canada and the West Indies and
inquire what steps, if any, have been taken by the
government to improve the situation.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I ask that this motion be allowed to stand.
In doing this, I wish to say to the honourable
senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) and the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
that the delay in answering the inquiry is
not caused by indifference or diffidence on
my part. On the contrary, I consider the
subject an important one, and I wish to deal
with it accordingly, but I am not prepared
to speak on it today.
It is my intention to participate in the
debate at the next sitting of the house, but
should any honourable senator care to discuss the matter before then, I shal be very
happy to make way for him.
The Order stands.

Kinley) brings to our attention the effect on
Canada's export trade of the peculiar cîrcumstances attendîng the difficulties in which
the United Kingdom finds itself as a result
of its shortage of the means of payment
necessary for purchases in the dollar area.
It instances the fact that Canadian export
trade to the sterling areas bas phayed a
large part in the economy of our country, and
particularly of the Maritimes. Honourable
senators will recaîl that early in the war, for
exactly the same reason, the export business
of the Annapolis Valley-which for a long
time had depended on the United Kingdom
market and in 1939 had reached a value of
$8,700,00-practically ceased to exist. It is
true that as a result of special arrangements
small isolated shipments are moving to the
United Kingdom, but this is not belicved to
be an indication of a restoration of the
valuable trade which has almost entirely
disappeared.
I would remind honourable
senators that the traditional trade in long
lumber between the Maritime Provinces and
the United Kingdom, which has been conducted now for approximately 200 years
reached in 1947 a value of over $20 million,
and a year later dropped to onhy slightly more
than $5 million. In 1948 pit-props to a value
of $7,00000 were sent to the United Kingdom.
This was almost entirely a war industry, and
it came to play an important part in the
economy of the Maritime Provinces, but the
prospects of shippiiig afly in the future are
uncertain.

Then we come to the trade situation which
my honourable friend from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) so clearly and concisely brought to our attention. He pointed
out that the trade between Canada and the
British West Indies was showing signs of
diminishing.

recent cuts have been severe, and competition

The trade in dried cod with the British

until recently bas been maintained. Honourable senators, particularly those from the
Maritime Provinces, may be interested to
hear the figures on dried cod export for the
years from 1938 to the first six months of
1949. They are as follows:

I must draw the attention of the bouse to the
fact that the last figure includes $739,000
worth of fish from Newfoundland. Therefore,
excepting the Newfoundland trade in this
commodity, exports of cod for the first half
of 1949 amounts to approximately half of our
total cod exports in 1948. The notes which
I have been given by the department indicate
that additional restrictions have come into
effect very recently, and the probability is
that 1950 business will suffer adversely. To
what extent it will be reduced, I cannot say.
Under the heading "manufactured products", the item covering automobiles offers
the best illustration of the plight of our
British West Indies export trade in manufactured goods.
The export trade in automobiles was well established under the
Empire preference plan and for a number
of years prior to the war the products of
Canadian plants enjoyed a very steady and
satisfactory market in the British West
Indies.
They have now been virtually
eliminated; not only bas the supply of automobiles been eut off, but standard parts and
accessories have been subjected to most
hampering restrictions.
Undoubtedly the reduction in our exports
to the British West Indies is due to three
One, the shortage of dollars over
factors.
the entire sterling area; two, increased competition on a price basis following the devaluation of the pound in relation to the dollar;
three, the increasing availability of goods
from other countries as trading conditions
return to normal. In pre-war years, total
purchases by the British West Indies from
Canada were only about $14 million a year.
Obviously many other countries were at that
time participating in the trade of the islands.
The marked subsequent increase of our

export trade was the result of various factors,
among them the unavailability of goods from
some of the traditional suppliers.
Of the causes I have cited, undoubtedly
the first, the over-all sterling shortage of
dollars, is the most important. As honourable senators know, the United Kingdom acts
as banker for the sterling areas, and in that
role allots to the British West Indies a supply
of dollars with which to purchase our goods.
The question of how much all the sterling
areas can afford to purchase is, therefore,
vitally important. Another relevant circumstance is that until comparatively recently
the value of imports from Canada by the
British West Indies materially exceerded that
of ber exports to this country. Undoubtedly
this fact was used by the United Kingdom
authorities as an argument for the restriction
of the import of Canadian goods to that area.
But beginning with 1949, as was pointed
out by the honourable senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) and confirmed
by the honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. MeLean), a change bas
taken place. In the first half of this year we
imported from the British West Indies goods
of the value of three or four million dollars
more than the total value of our exports to
that area. If this trend should continue, as
I expect it will, it would constitute a good
argument why the United Kingdom should
increase the allocation of dollars to the British
West Indies for the purchase of Canadian
goods. At the same time one must concede
that, in circumstances of this kind, it is
difficult to consider one segment or section
of a problem in isolation from the problem
in

general.

As a result of the financial difficulty in
which the United Kingdom finds herself, she
proposes, as honourable senators, know, to
drastically reduce ber purchases from the
dollar area. But, while giving weight to the
over-riding consideration of the dollar income
of the sterling area as a whole, for which the
United Kingdom acts as banker, and to which
bo a certain extent she makes dollar allocations, it can be argued that if the position
of the British West Indies bas improved in
relation to ber exports to Canada, the dollar
allocation should be increased, just as the
reverse condition was held to justify a reduction in the dollar allowance.

be interesting to know what it is. It appears

NOVEMBER 21, 1949
to me that it would be a factor in the question
of the allocation by Great Britain of more
dollars for purchases in this country.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am afraid I have
not the information for which the honourable
senator asks. I cannot undertake to explain
the direct relation between the over-all shortage of dollars and allowances by Britain to
various parts of the sterling area. I might
however point out, as having some bearing
on the matter, the present position of our
trade with the United Kingdom. For the
trading year 1948-49, purchases by the United
Kingdom from the dollar area, including
Canada and the United States were of the
order of $1,600 millions. This amount she
proposes to reduce next year, as a result of
the stringent financial situation, to $1,200
millions. Of this sum about half will be spent
on purchases from Canada. The deficit represented by the difference between what she
buys from Canada and what she expects to
sell here will be met, first, from the balance
of the loan which we extended some time ago,
and which now may again be ùsed. You will
recall that the loan amounted to $1,250 millions. At a certain time, because of our financial difficulties, further drawings on this
credit were suspended. But with the improvement of our commercial situation, drawings
have been resumed to the extent of $10
million a month. I am advised that at that rate
the advance will have been exhausted about
the end of 1950. The balance of the deficit
is provided for by funds from E.C.A., which
are made available for what are known as
offshore purchases, including purchases by
the United Kingdom of Canadian goods.
The action of the United Kingdom in curtailing so drastically her imports from the
dollar area arises, of course, from the knowledge that our loan will have been entirely
expended at the end of next year, and that
E.C.A. assistance will expire in 1952. Strenuous attempts are being made to increase her
exports to this country and the United States,
but as yet it is too soon to say how far these
efforts will succeed.
Honourable senators, this represents the
clearest outline I can give of the over-all
trade picture and the specific situation of the
British West Indies.
The restricted state of trade between
Canada and the British West Indies is not an
isolated instance, and indeed I think in many
ways the Maritime exporter to the British
West Indies is in a relatively better position
than some of the other Maritime exporters.
The question is, what is the Canadian government going to do about it?

Under the circumstances it is very difficult
for the government to make effective representations to the United Kingdom government, other than the general one of having
the United Kingdom increase her over-all
purchases to the greatest possible extent.
Needless to say, in the difficult position in
which the United Kingdom finds herself
through the shortage of dollars, she elects
what she will buy from Canada. Naturally
she buys only those items which are most
difficult or impossible to get from the sterling
areas. It is probably true that while our
purchases from the British West Indies are a
part of the general sterling area purchases,
any marked increase from that area would
materially help the British West Indies in
securing a larger allotment of dollars from
the United Kingdom. Practically all of our
sugar will be obtained from Empire sources
this year, largely from the British West Indies.
Canadian tariff duties have been waived to
facilitate entry of approximately 600,000 cases
of British West Indies fruit juices out of
United Kingdom stocks.
I have been advised that representations
have been made as to the desirability of maintaining the maximum flow of goods from Canada to the British West Indies. This is being
done in order to facilitate and make possible
a continuation of the shipping facilities with
this area, because it must be perfectly obvious
that if two-way cargoes are not available,
the shipping facilities may be considerably
and materially lessened.
Honourable senators, the government is
particularly anxious that the volume of
exports from Canada to the British West
Indies should not drop to the low pre-war
level. As I pointed out before, the total
exports to the British West Indies were only
about $14 million a year. They never exceeded
this amount, and a grave question arose as
to whether or not the rather heavy shipping
costs being incurred by Canada justified the
relatively low export trade.
It is difficult to say what action the government can take other than, perhaps, follow
the suggestions which I have outlined.
Honourable senators should remember that
important as this trade is to those engaged
in it, and desirable as it is to maintain the
trade, other Maritime exporters are faced
with even greater problems, at least from a
dollar and cent point of view. In the face
of changing times and the difficulties this
country is bound to encounter in matters such
as this, it is indeed fortunate that alternative
markets are available. Industries should
remember, as I believe they do, the good old
principle that when you knock on the door

SENATE
off one customer and you do flot succeed, you
knock on another door of another customer.
I know off an exporter in Nova Scotia who
bas almost completely lost his export market
for lumber in the United Kingdom. 1 arn
flot certain what his export volume was, but
it equalled the whole export trade of the
Maritime Provinces with the West Indies.
Like the rest off us he hopes that in due
course Ibis United Kingdom market wil1
return, but hie has commenced to change bis
manufacturing processes in order to seli bis
product on the American market. Honourable
senators xviii realize that the major export
market for long lumber for the Maritime
Provinces, particularly Nova Scotia, has been
the United Kingdom. It has been a longestablished market, and its specifications have
been entirely different from those off the
American market, wbich contemplate more
manuffacturing. Well, this partidular exporter
I have in mind probably lost far more heavîly
in bis trade with the United Kingdoma than
did any individual exporter to the British
West Indies, and hie is now trying to establish
markets in the United States.
In connection with the exportation of fish
and lumber 1 would point out that it xvas said
in tbis bouse and elsewhere that the fixing
of our dollar at par would resuit in decreasing
our sales on the United States market, or at
least in tbe loss off a potential market. But
it must be remcmbered tbat coincident with
the devaluation off the pound sterling, tbe
Canadian dollar was devalued by 10 per cent.
Tbis resulted in a corresponding advantage
in the American market, whicb I arn advîsed
is now relatively good for botb flsb and
lumber. These are possibilities wbicb migbt
be explored, and I hope soon to introduce
]egislation in tbe Senate wbicb will indicate
that tbe Department of Fisberies will inaugurate a campaign to induce tbe people of
Central Canada, who bave flot been too well
educated about tbe value of Atlantic fish, to
cat more off tbis fisb tban tbey do at the
presenit time.
In addition, there is off course tbe general
need off endeavouring to import mbt this
country from the sterling area far more than
we bave ever imported beffore. That may
become a permanent need, and, as was said
by the honourable gentleman f rom Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), tbe problem off bow to
meet it will not be solved by any sleight
of band.
In pre-war days it was relatively easy
for us to trade witb other countries, and we
hardly ever heard off inconvertibility off
currencies. Perhaps the present inconvertibility may be a blessing ini disguise, for it
brings forcibly to our minds the fact tbat,
after ah, trade is the excbange of goods.

This xvas a point made in the interesting
speech cdelivered by the bonourable gentleman from Soutbern New Brunswvick (Hon.
Mr. M.\cLean). He reminded the house that
wben ships first sailed frorn the Maritimes
to slart trading -xvith tbe West Indies, tbey
tLook witb tborn flsb, lum-ber and otber Canacdian produets. and tbat the chief interest off
the owners off those goods was bow mucb
tropical produce they could get in return. As
the borourable gentleman said, a few British
pounds muy have cbanged hands, but tbe
ia-portant tbing was the making of n deal
for the exebange of goods between the two
countries. But now our trade bas developed
1, a point where this simple barter is no
longer practicable.
1 do not want to embark upon a very
irdricate subject, but I imagine that TLhe convertibility off currencies is governeci to a
reasonablo dcgree by balance off brade. The
nakceI fact is that if we wisb to seli more
,oods to the sterling area we must increase
our purchases from that area.
There are, rougbly, tbree ways in which
we may do this. Probably the simplest xvay
off ail is by purchasing more tropical products
xvhich do flot compete wibb commodities producedt in Canada. One obstacle to this might
be reluctance on the part off importers to
depart from their traditional sources of
^upply. For instance, a firm wbicb bas for
long, years been purchasing goods in the
United States migbt not wish to place its
orders lu an cntirely different market, like
the British West Indies. Another obstacle
migbt be reluctance on the part of United
Kîngdom authorities to permit fruit juices
and other foods to be dive-ted fromn British
consumers,, for cerbainly it cannot be said that
tbere is an excessive supply of such foods
lu Britain.
A second means off increasing imports
from the sterling area would be the purchase
in that area of a portion off the capital goods
or engineering goods whicb we now obtain
from the United States. Tbere migbt possibly be some objection to this course by
people wbo are familiar witb certain
American, goods and prefer tbem to the
varieties obtainable in the sterling area. But
this objection would probably flot be very
serlous, as the goods are imported lu any
event and do not compete with our own
products.
A third means would be increased purchases from the sterling area off goods tbat
directly compete witb products off this
country. This method would present considerable difficulty. The ffact is that tbe
people in the dollar area, and particularly
in the United States, bave given away their

NOVEMBER 21, 1949
surpluses rather than take goods in exchange.
In a recent report Mr. Dean Acheson stated
that American exports over the last thirtyfive years had exceeded imports by about
$101 billion. In matters of trade we tend to
follow the American pattern fairly closely,
and there might be strenuous objection in this
country to increased importation of goods
that compete with Canadian products. Our
attitude in this respect may be widely
divergent from the principles advocated by
Cobden and Bright, but there it is, and it
presents a very serious difficulty in the way
of increasing trade with the sterling area.
Let me try to give a practical illustration
of this. I suppose that the ports of Halifax
and Saint John are more keenly interested
than any other Canadian cities in the export
and import trade of this country with the
sterling area, especially with the United
Kingdom. By and large, the livelihood of
the people in these ports depends upon the
flow of commerce, in and out. It is of the
greatest importance to them that our export
trade with the United Kingdom should
expand; but of course we cannot increase
our exports to that country unless we buy
more from it. Up to the time when the
British currency was devalued, the chief
argument heard here against buying more
goods from Britain was that the prices were
too high. Devaluation has changed that
picture to some degree, though I have always
felt that, even if prices were competitive, it
would not be easy to increase imports of
goods that directly competed with goods
made here. For example, ocean-going ships
built in Canada cost probably 50 per cent
more than they would if built in the United
Kingdom. Now, in Halifax there is a shipbuilding plant, and I venture to say that if
my honourable friend from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) and I went
down there and advocated that, by way of
helping Britain to earn more dollars, and
thereby to purchase more lumber and fish
from the Maritimes, we should place some
orders with shipyards in the United Kingdom,
there would be a storm of protest.

one of the big problems.

Honourable senators, apart altogether from
past and present markets for our lumber
and fish, and regardless of whether the
markets we have lost in the sterling area will
be replaced by others, make no mistake that
the over-all trade picture presents a serious
problem to Canada. For the sake of argument let us assume that when our loan to
Great Britain runs out she will have been
unable to increase her exports to the dollar
area. Let us further assume that those goods
which she has regarded as essential purchases
in the dollar area have become available in
the sterling area. Under those circumstances
it becomes quite obvious that Britain's imports from Canada would cease, with the
result that the prosperity of this part of the
world would be in grave danger. Ports which
have no ships going in and out do very little
business. There may be markets in Canada
for our lumber and fish, but the problem
which confronts us transcends the immediate
dollar value and market price.
I wish to repeat something I said two
years ago, namely, that the question of trade
is one which warrants the attention of an
appropriate committee of this house. We
have here experts in all lines, particularly
in the field of trade. No person in Canada
knows more about the fish industry than my
honourable friend from southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean). His product goes
all over the world. I now suggest that when
parliament reconvenes, in a new session, an
appropriate committee should undertake to
investigate the vital problem of trade
relations.
I close by quoting a paragraph from the
concluding remarks of the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). Speaking
recently on the resolution now before us, he
said:
I wish to say that this imbalance of trade, or
this so-called dollar problem, is not something
which can be cured by some sleight-of-hand on the
part of a government here or anywhere else.
Before we have passed through these troubled times
we will have to exercise all the patience and forbearance we possess.

Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

CANADA'S IMPORTS FROM THE BRITISH WEST INDIES
NomEs:
1. Fruit Juices
During first nine months of 1949 fruit juices (orange, grapefruit and blends) in the amount of $635,188
were imported from the United Kingdom. Most, if nlot ail, of this was of British West Indian origin.
During the third quarter of 1949 grapefruit juice in the amount of 335,899 was imported direct from
Jamaica and Trinidad.
2. Sugar
During the past few years the greater part of imports of sugar for refining have switched fromn the British
West Indies to such non-commonwealth sources as Cuba and the Dominican Republic. However, in the
first eight months of 1949 the position was reversed with almost three-quarters of the Dominion's supply
coming from the British West Indies.
3. Molasses
Molasses imports during the first cighit months of 1949 have been greatly rcduccd froxn the 1948 figure,
all sources having been affectcd.
4. Bauxite Ore

DAYLIGHT SAVING
MOTION

Hon. W. D. Euler rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That in the opinion of the Senate the practice
of daylight saving should be made uniform as to
the day and heur of its commencement and its termination and that the Railways of Canada should
conform to the general practice so established.

Hon. Mr. Euler: He would not know-unless
he inquired in advance-whether Hamilton
was on daylight saving time or standard time.
He might arrive there just at the conclusion
of the meeting, or at least he would probably
be an hour late. On the other hand, if a man
from Hamilton went to London to attend
a meeting, without first making inquiry as to
the time in effect at London, he might arrive
an hour too soon. Likewise, if he went to
Kitchener, he would probably arrive there an
hour too soon; but of course that would not
be any great-

He said: Honourable senators, I am quite
sure there will be no misunderstanding as
to the purpose of this motion. It is not my

part of the government would be favourably
received by the majority of the Canadian
people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I have much pleasure in supporting the resolution just presented by the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). I
think the subject matter is a highly desirable
one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator address himself to the constitutional
question?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am coming to that point.
As to the expediency of bringing the matter
before the Canadian public and the desirability of the subject matter, I am sure there
is unanimity of opinion. Whether Parliament has jurisdiction or not, I think it is
desirable that the matter be brought to the
attention of the public. The inconvenience
to which the mover has referred should be
eliminated. For instance, the difference in
time between such cities as Hull and Ottawa,
Montreal and Toronto, and even between
cities within the province of Ontario, is a
matter of serious concern to a great many
people. Therefore I say that from the point
of view of the expediency of bringing this
question to the attention of the Senate, and
the desirability of accomplishing the intention
and purpose of this motion, I am wholly in
favour of it.
My honourable friend the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
raised a question. As my attention was
brought to this motion only as recently as
lunch-time today, I have not had time to
refer to and review the discussion which took
place with respect to the constitutionality
of federal legislation on this subject. If my
memory serves me correctly, serious doubts
have been entertained as to the power of the
federal parliament to deal with a matter of
this kind.
As I recall, the subject of daylight saving
was first introduced into parliament by Sir
George Foster, who, in the absence of Sir
Robert Borden in England, was acting as
leader of the government in another place.
At that time there were many expressions
of misgiving. I recall particularly that the
western members voiced the objection that
no matter how much you might advance the
lock you would not advance the rising of
the sun, and that the workers, who came out
from the cities or small towns in truckloads,
would arrive too early to do any useful work,
because the dew was still on the ground, and
further, would insist upon returning to their
homes long before sunset. I recall that in

the rural constituency of Lotbiniere in the
province of Quebec, for which at that time
I was member, the farmers said they liked
"l'heure du Bon Dieu mieux que l'heure de
Monsieur Borden".
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Vien: They liked the hour of our
Lord God much better than the hour of Mr.
Borden. That was the reaction among our
farmers. But when the law had been in
effect for a few years, everybody, I think,
admitted that "summer time" was of great
advantage to the vast majority of the people
of Canada; and the law which was introduced
at the time of the War Measures Act was continued without very much objection.
As regards the question put by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) I am not prepared to offer any
considered opinion. If J remember correctly,
great doubts were expressed and, as far as
I can recollect, the question was never
decided. I myself have considerable doubt
about it, because I cannot find in the wording
of the British North America Act any definite
stipulation or disposition which would
govern the case.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: "Peace, order and good
government."
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, those words cover a
multitude of sins, but they are not allinclusive.
I congratulate the mover of this motion.
It is timely: it will bring to the attention of
all concerned the expediency of adopting,
whether through the Parliament of Canada
or the provincial legislatures, enactments
which will gradually bring about a uniformity in fixing the time of the clock.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I am strongly in sympathy with the honourable senator who moved this motion-that is,
so far as the confusion caused by cities
having different times is concerned; but I
am opposed to changing the time at all.
The honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) referred to the complications
arising from daylight saving in the West
because of the dew. It is not so much the
dew as the frost which causes the difficulty.
On many mornings in May one may be held
up by frost until 9 o'clock; and if you have
hired help and are endeavouring to work
your men on the basis of a modern "day"
you lose valuable hours if you attempt to
operate on fast time.
As to the legal point, I speak of course as
a layman; but I believe the federal enactment
of daylight saving time was possible only by
reason of the War Measures Act, because a

NOVEMBER 22, 1949
year ago it was a provincial body, the Government of Alberta, which passed a law
making it illegal for anyone in that province
to alter time. Elither in so doing the Alberta
government exceeded its powers, or the
federal government has not authority to pass
legislation affecting the whole dominion. In
any case I am opposed to a change at all. If
a person wishes to have the advantage of an
extra hour of daylight, and it is his practice
to go to his office at 9 o'clock, for the life of
me I cannot see why he cannot go at 8 o'clock
instead, or why it is necessary to make these
changes from one time to the other by statute.
The daylight hours are not lengthened one
minute.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: My colleague
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) has
expressed a viewpoint on behalf of the West,
concerning the danger of the effect of frost
in connection with the handling of grain. I,
being a small farmer, should like to speak on
behalf of the farmers of Ontario. I am quite
sympathetic towards urban dwellers like the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), who has spoken properly and quite
adequately on behalf of the city men, the
factory workers, and the baseball fans who
are interested in extended evenings during
the summer months and the early fall. But
I think the fact has been overlooked that this
issue is one between what is roughly called
town and country, and that it will remain
insoluble until a great many years have
passed and the millenium has arrived,
because, no matter how uniformly this legislation may be made to apply, even to the
vast majority of the people of this country, it
cannot create a uniformity of habit and
practice on the part of dairy cows, poultry
and horses, or even of the birds that chirp at
one's window at the correct time every
morning, regardless of daylight saving plans.
Possibly those who want daylight saving
are not unlike the cock, that character of
Rostand's "Chantecler," who thought he made
the sun rise every morning when he started
to crow. We who live in the country believe
that the rooster crows when he sees the sun
rise, which is just the reverse procedure. I
am quite in favour of my honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), and those
who lead an industrial and urban life,
enjoying all the daylight saving they want;
but I still insist that in the country we have
to be governed by the laws of nature, and
respond to the awakening calls of the barnyard poultry and the demand of the cows to
be milked. Incidentally, if we were to
inquire why our railway schedules run as
they do, we would find that they are based
on Canada's fundamental and basic needs
which originated in our rural districts.

Hon. Mr. Vien: May I ask my honourable
friend whether he is not of the opinion that
if the hands of the clock are to be tampered
with, the tampering should be uniform?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think it is
possible to establish a uniform time which
would apply to all classes of this community.
Hon. Mr. Euler: We had it before.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes, but I doubt
whether it ever really applied. I know that
where I live most of the year, the farmer
pays no attention whatsoever to daylight
saving, and I adjust myself to him.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is no objection to
the farmer doing what he likes.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, it is rather difficult to keep track of the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). When we are discussing something which financially affects the city of
Ottawa he becomes an urban dweller, and
when we are discussing a matter which affects
daylight saving time and the crowing of
roosters, he becomes a rural dweller.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I have much sympathy
with the suggestion of the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), but I
do not think it is practical. The question
of daylight saving as it concerns the Kingston
area has been raised many times. The city
is on daylight saving, the country is on standard time, and that is the way it goes on.
Whether or not it is because it is a small
country, the entire United Kingdom has uniformity of time, and this includes the railways. All go on daylight time together. I
might say that during the war they even
had double-daylight saving time at the height
of the summer season.
I am wondering whether the railways of
the United States plan to change from standard to daylight time, because if we should
change to daylight time and they should not,
I think it would cause a great deal of confusion to travelers passing through such
border points as Buffalo and Detroit.
While I appreciate the idea behind this
motion, I feel that we should continue the
present system. There is no doubt that farmers dislike daylight saving time. I have
talked to many of them, and I know it
causes them inconvenience. On the other
hand, we must think of the many factory
workers in the cities and towns. They should
be allowed to have daylight saving in order
that they may enjoy baseball, golf and other
activities which are perhaps necessary in a
full urban life.

SENATE
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I should like to endorse what the honourable
member frorn Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
has said. Our farmers are rather confused
by daylight saving. For instance, sometimes
they hurry into town in the afternoons on
urgent business only to find everything closed
up. Anotiher point is that children do not
like to go to bed when the sun is still shining.
Alberta is strongly opposed to daylight saving
and has legislated against it.
I quite appreciate what has been said
about sports and the saving of electric power
resulting fron daylight saving; but farmers
are definitely opposed to it.
There would also be trouble with the railways, because in Canada we have Pacific
time, Mountain time, Central time, Eastern
time and Atlantic time, and in making out
their schedules months ahead the railways
must have regard for the way the earth goes
around the sun. If the railways had to
re-adjust their schedules in accordance with
daylight saving, the complications which now
exist would be greatly increased, and the
confusion would be tremendous.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is always
interesting because he has a habit of introducing subjects which are more or less controversial. This is one of them. There was
a move in the Manitoba legislature last year
to abolish daylight saving, and the only
reason the measure did not carry was that a
large percentage of the members represented
rural parts of the province. An undertaking
was given that a referendum would be held
in Greater Winnipeg, asking the ratepayers
whether or not they were in favour of daylight saving. This referendum was recently
held, and the majority in favour of daylight
saving was very small. I think the honourable leader of the opposition will verify this.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Was not the reason
given that it was purely to save electricity?

get up earlier in the morning and go to work
at eight o'clock instead of nine and quit at
four o'clock instead of five.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The same principle,
reversed, would apply to the farmer. He
could adjust himself to it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The farmer has no time
to adjust himself to these things. His seasons
are short; lie has to do his work in a certain
time or lie will not long remain on the land.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He can do his work in
daylight no matter what the lock says.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: He cannot train the
cows though.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) may be
better acquainted with the farm situation
than I am, but I happen to be a farmer and
I live amongst farmers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, I have been on the
farm.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Not very often. I am
of the opinion that the question of daylight
saving should be left to the discretion of the
people, but I do not see how we are going
to enforce it no matter what legislation is
put on the statute books. The people in rural
sections, who make up a large part of our
population, find daylight saving confusing,
and do not want it. As far as I am concerned, I am against it.

Hon. J. P. Howden: Honourable senators,
I am all for daylight saving. I remember
when it was first adopted in Manitoba, and
the extra hour of daylight was, I believe,
very generally appreciated. At the time I
was mayor of a small town out there. An
extra hour of sunshine in the morning is very
beneficial to children. Naturally, they do not
get up before their parents, and adults in
cities stay in bed long after daybreak.
Farmers object to daylight saving, but they

move, because the people in the rural sections,
the great majority of our population, did not
want daylight saving at all.

Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I think there would be no controversy over
this matter if the suggestion made by the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
were followed. After all, nobody disputes
that factory workers and other residents of
cities benefit by an extra hour of sunlight
daily during the summer, but in order to
benefit in this way it is not necessary to
advance the clock. Surely, in any community,
people who wish to enjoy an additional hour
of sunlight after work can begin work an
hour earlier than usual and quit an hour
sooner.
Many difficulties would be met with in
trying to make daylight saving uniform. For
one thing, even if we made the attempt, in
Canada we could not avoid confusion arising
from the fact that some states across the
American border adopt daylight saving and
others do not. It seems to me that we might
as well try to set uniform hours for the rise
and fall of tides. Out on the west coast,
where we have a lot of shipping, it is important to know when tides rise and fall, and
a mistake of an hour might cause a serious
accident.
It has already been pointed out that the
farmer gets up with the sun, in any event, so
it is not necessary to have daylight saving
time for him. And certainly people in cities
can, if they wish, arrange to start their workday in summer an hour earlier than in other
seasons. There is no question that an extra
hour of sunlight is good for children and for
factory and office workers, but the point is
that we do not need to change the clock in
order that they may get this extra hour.
Hon. J. P. Mclntyre: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to oppose the motion of my
honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), although on some three previous
occasions I have been against legislation that
he has brought before the house. We live in
a democratic country, and one of the principles of democracy is majority rule.
In my own province of Prince Edward
Island about 75 per cent of the people live
in rural sections. Last year the city of
Charlottetown wanted to adopt daylight saving, but the rural population was utterly
opposed to it. In order to prevent confusion
our government-unlike the Government of
Alberta, to which the honourable gentleman
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) referred
-declared adoption of daylight saving in the
province to be illegal. I think this was a wise

Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
question raised by the motion of the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
is one of great interest, as is indicated by
the large number of members who have
taken part in the discussion. I imagine that
almost every citizen in Canada has his or
her views on daylight saving. In speaking
to his motion the senator from Waterloo said
that he was seeking uniformity. I agree that
uniformity is desirable, but it may be obtained
in its best form without daylight saving at all.
Time is of importance to everybody, even
to politicians. I am reminded of the story
of a politician who excused himself for
making a long speech by pointing out that
there was no clock in the hall. A member
of the audience shouted "But there is a
calendar behind you."
Some sixty-five years ago nearly every
place in Canada had its own time. In that.
era, when a distance of a few miles meant
a day's travel, lack of uniformity in time
was not of such great importance as it has
become now that railroads, airplanes and
radio have made rapid travel and communication possible.
Somebody has said that the farmer does
not like daylight saving. I know that, for
I have a farm myself, and there are a good
many farms in my section of Nova Scotia.
Daylight saving would not make farmers get
up an hour earlier than usual, but their help
would want to quit an hour earlier in the
afternoon. That would mean the loss of
perhaps the best hour in the day for work
on the farm.
As I come from one of the Maritime
Provinces I must also point out that I do not
think daylight saving would be good for the
fisherman. He has to get up before daylight,
anyway. When at sea it would not matter
to him what time system was in vogue on
shore, for when a ship is out of sight of land
it is in the meridian time zone.
It was in 1878 that Sir Sandford Fleming
first suggested the general use of what are
now called standard time zones, and his suggestion was adopted in 1884. Under his plan
Canada was divided into six time zones;
and now, with the entry of Newfoundland,
we have seven. There is, I think, about
twenty-nine minutes' difference between
Atlantic standard time, which we have in
the Maritime Provinces, and Newfoundland
time, which is three hours and thirty-oneminutes behind Greenwich time.

45785-21J

SENATE
The standard time zones in Canada, in
addition to the Newfoundland zone, are
known as Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific and Yukon. Each zone includes
all the territory between two meridians,
fifteen degrees of longitude apart. Difference
in time is calculated at four minutes to a
degree of longitude, but for purposes of
convenience uniform time prevails throughout the zone. Immediately one passes over
the boundary of any zone the time changes
by an hour, backward or forward, depending
upon whether one is going west or east. Of
course, in proportion as places are situated
in a more northerly latitude, their days are
longer in summer even without daylight
saving. This is probably the reason why in
the Canadian West, where in the settled areas
the summer day is an hour or even two
hours longer than in the industrial East,
daylight saving is not in vogue.
I recall during the war years, when we
had daylight saving time one winter, that
our help in the shipyard would come to work
at 8 o'clock in the morning, and as there
was no artificial lighting they could do little
until 9 o'clock. That is a reason against
the idea of daylight saving time.
Uniformity, of course, should be the main
purpose behind any time arrangement. I can
think of no better uniformity than we have
had with standard time, since its adoption
at the Washington Conference of 1884. The
question of time is a matter of provincial
concern, and all arrangements made since
that conference, except during wartime, have
been made by the provinces. But I believe
that time is of such general concern to Canada
that we might well raise the point of provincial jurisdiction in this field, and perhaps
by arrangement come to uniformity by
federal control throughout Canada.
If there is one question which should be
federally controlled in a positive and simple
fashion, I think it is time. After all daylight
saving time is only a device to try to conform
to the habits-perhaps bad habits-of many
people. There is no reason why the people
in the cities could not get up an hour earlier,
or why the country folk should be asked to
conform to a time which is entirely strange
to them.
For these reasons I would hesitate to say
that daylight saving time has done us any
good. Workmen in our plant are largely in
favour of the summer time, as it is called in
England, because they like to have an extra
hour of sunlight after their day's work ends
at 5 o'clock. Perhaps, with the use of modern
machinery, the day will come when men will
not have to work until 5 o'clock. Some
businesses now operate only until noon on

Saturday, and others close for the whole day.
With the shortening of man's hours of labour
it may be that the workman would be in
favour of leaving time as it is.
I congratulate my honourable friend for
bringing the matter before the house. The
subject is a timely one, but at present there
is much confusion about it. On the question
of whether the Senate should recommend the
universal use of daylight saving time, I am
not sure; but above all I think that time
should be uniform.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I cannot recall a debate in this house since I
have been a member which was participated
in by so many senators as this one. I have
been wondering why there is so much
interest in the question. The reason which
occurs to me is that honourable senators
realize how precious is time. I conclude that
my honourable colleagues feel that time is
slipping away fast enough, and that we should
be content to go on God's time, therefore the
consensus of opinion seems to be opposed to
fast time.
The question of jurisdiction has come up
since 1918, when my distinguished colleagues
and others were members of the House of
Commons-I should say the other placeHon. Mr. Euler: Leave it at that.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: -and the courts have
not settled it. To my mind the question of
time comes under the control of the provinces
-I would even go further and say that it is
a municipal and even a personal right.
Whether I get up with the sun or an hour
later is a matter of personal choice. The
question of provincial jurisdiction is so sacred,
and the concern about provincial autonomy
is so strong on the part of the Premier of
Quebec, that I am sure his next open letter
to the newspapers will be to this effect: God
and I are the only ones who can fix time.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: This question is of considerable concern to the farmers. Only a
minority of the citizens of this country belong
to unions, though we seem to think in terms
of an 8-hour day and a 44-hour week. For
instance, the doctor does not belong to a
union, nor does the lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about the Bar
Association?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: As far as hours are concerned the lawyer does not quit work when
the clock strikes 5; neither does the doctor
or the farmer.
There is easy communication between the
urban and rural populations today, and sometimes the farmer goes to such cities as

NOVEMBER 22, 1949
Montreal or Toronto to hire help. If he gets
a man who has been accustomed to working
the hours fixed by a union and, who when the
farmer gets up at half-past 4 or 5 o'clock to
go to the field to get the horses or milk the
cows, insists that be will not start work at
that hour, the arrangement is impractical. As
the son of a farmer, I am sure my father
would have been very unhappy had I decided
to advance the time one hour and quit work
at five o'clock instead of 6. Of course in
those days we worked until the sun set; and
sometimes, when there was hay or grain to
be brought to the barn, we unloaded it by
lantern light.
If one visits the western provinces, as I
did some years ago, one finds that at such
places as the Pas, the Peace River District,
Prince Albert or Lake Waskesiu, which is
about a hundred miles north of Prince Albert,
the people are able to read their newspapers
on their verandahs at 11 o'clock at night.
Would the farmers there be willing to
accept a change by which time was advanced
one hour? No, sir.
In a country as vast as this, with such great
differences in latitude and longitude, uniformity or unanimity is impossible. I for one
am in full accord with those who think that
if the urban dweller wants to play golf or
attend a baseball game a little earlier, he
should exercise his right to leave his office
an hour or so earlier.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: I realize, not for
the first time, that although the war has been
over for more than four years the question
of daylight saving time has not been settled,
because each section of the community wants
to act in its own interests. Reference has
been made to the position of the farmer. One
day I asked a lady what were her views as
regards standard time and daylight saving
time. She said "It is the same thing for me;
but when I ask my cow and my bens, they
refuse to change their clocks." The same
limitation affects farmers, who cannot work
before the sun has dried the soil, or melted
the frost.
Conditions are not everywhere the same;
we can progress only by compromise. One
cannot expect to exercise a right without
regard to others; but if we co-operate, if we
show a spirit of charity and harmony, we shall
arrive at a solution while preserving the unity
of the nation, and the question of legal
constitutionality or unconstitutionality will be
of less concern. As people advance they
adopt many new methods and processes; and
instead of being controlled by our own brains
and intelligence, we are controlled in the
streets by red and green lights, and in this
matter we are controlled by a clock.

Hon. John T. Haig: I may not be here on
Friday, and present indications are that the
debate may last at least until then and that
the Senate may have to sit on Saturday in
order to finish it.
When I first read in the record that the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) was putting forward a motion about
daylight saving I said, though I did not know
its exact terms, that it would produce more
debate in this chamber than any other subject.
It has already done so. I gather from the fact
that my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) appears to be
getting ready to adjourn the debate, that
he intends to carry it on tomorrow. He raises
the question of jurisdiction. The dominion
government can institute daylight saving in
relation to all mattters which come within
dominion jurisdiction. For instance,Hon. Mr. Hayden: The railroads.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -the railroads would be
bound by such legislation; so would the civil
service, and the post office.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And the banks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And the banks. All those
spheres are within the jurisdiction of the
Dominion Government. But as regards the
hours at which schools and courts shall open,
provincial legislation would apply. So to my
mind it has always been a case of split jurisdiction in which, perhaps, the cities also are
involved. The Act passed in 1918 was not war
legislation, but an ordinary statute of the
Canadian Parliament. Our fundamental difficulty may be illustrated in this way. A man
comes from rural Manitoba to the city of
Winnipeg: he looks at the city hall lock and
sees that it is half-past eleven; be looks at
his watch, which indicates only half-past
ten; and he uses some hard language against
the citizens of Winnipeg for having such a
fool system. But in 1918 his time was halfpast eleven too, exactly the same as city time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And he never noticed the
difference.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Once uniform time is in
effect for two or three days you think no more
about it. Take the case of those of us who
live in the West. I get on the train at Winnipeg according to ordinary standard time.
That night before I go to bed I advance my
watch one hour. I arrive at Ottawa, where
we have daylight saving, and I put on my
watch another hour. During those two or
three nights or days I have a good deal of
trouble; I cannot get to sleep at 11 o'clock
because I am not used to retiring at that time;
it is midnight or past before I feel sleepy.
Half-past twelve here is half-past ten at

SENATE

Winnipeg. But inside of a week I have ceased
to notice any difference. This morning when
I rose, at half-past seven, I was not affected
by the fact that it was only half-past five
at Winnipeg. I ate my breakfast at a quarterpast eight and enjoyed it just as much as if
I had been eating it in Winnipeg at a different
hour. It is not daylight saving which has
caused the hard feelings. They have been
caused by the railroads, for instance, which
operate on standard time. A man notices that
his train leaves at 8 o'clock, and because of
the different time standards he gets down an
hour too early.
Everyone of us can remember that in 1918, a
week after daylight saving was enacted you
never heard the subject mentioned at all.
Specifically, the farmers never mentioned it.
What makes the farmer mad-and I understand how he feels about it-is that he thinks
we city people have swelled heads and
imagine ourselves to be better than he is.
That is not so. In fact most of us come
frorn the farms. I can speak with some
authority, for I was raised on a farm. But
when the farmer comes to town and finds
another system in effect, he is angry. So
would some of you be if you went into the
country to keep an appointment and found
yourself there an hour too soon. I agree with
a previous speaker that if we had a set time
authorized from the lst of May to the lst of
November, within a week everybody would
accept it and nothing more would be heard
about it.
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) says that we should get
up an hour earlier. If we had daylight
saving the farmers could stay in bed an
hour longer. They would not need to get
up at six o'clock any more; they could get
up at seven o'clock like city people do.
Believe me, I have never yet seen the farmer
who could not acquire this habit mighty
soon. He can fall into it just as quickly as
the next man.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Your
farmers is very limited.

knowledge

of

Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so, but I
know enough about them. Now, the only
reason why there is any opposition to daylight saving in Winnipeg is the fact that the
rural districts of Manitoba are on standard
time, and there is always a clash between
the two. The recent referendum in Winnipeg
proved that the majority of the people wanted
daylight saving.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It was only a small
majority.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, six out of the eight
districts voted for daylight saving. Although
I believe in daylight saving I would have
voted against it had I been there. I believe
the people of Manitoba should have an extra
hour of sunshine during the summer months,
but I do not favour daylight saving when it
results in a clash between two elements.
The honourable senator who introduced
this motion (Hon. Mr. Euler) argued that we
have got to have uniformity. In that I agree
with him, because without it the thing is a
failure.
I hope honourable senators will pardon
a personal reference. I have to go to Hamilton
on Friday to attend an important meeting
there. As soon as I knew this, the first thing
I did was to inquire whether Hamilton was
on daylight saving or standard time. Otherwise I might have landed in Hamilton an
hour early, and honourable senators will
appreciate what a strain it would be to arrive
in that city an hour too soon. Perhaps, as
there is no one here from Hamilton, I should
not say too much about that city.
We can pass this motion and still be
opposed to daylight saving or in favour of
it, as the case may be. The motion before
the house is simply a request that daylight
saving be made uniform across Canada. If
it is the judgment of the people of Canada
that we should have only standard time I will
not object, but I believe that uniformity
would be better for the whole country. As
I mentioned before, a farmer said to me,
"You city people are trying to make us get
up an hour carlier in the morning". I said
that this was not so. Then he argued that
the cows had to be milked at a certain time
of the day, and I said, "My dear friend, the
cows in Manitoba are milked an hour earlier
than the cows in Saskatchewan; the cows in
Ontario are milked an hour earlier than
those in Manitoba; the cows in Quebec are
milked an hour earlier than those in Ontario,
and the cows in the Maritimes are milked
an hour earlier than the cows in Quebec".
Hon. Mr. Dupuis,: And they are milked
twelve hours later in China.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sure. But the cows are
not raising any objection, and they are still
giving milk.
My honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) has introduced a real good
idea, and I feel that the people of Canada
will agree that the practice of daylight saving
should be made uniform on a national scale.
I am perfectly willing to have this motion
adopted. It will not change our laws, of

NOVEMBER 22, 1949
course, but it will at least give parliament
something to think about. Without infringing upon the rulesSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -I think the members of
the other place could have used five hours of
their time yesterday to better purpose had
they discussed the question of daylight saving
rather than the matters they were talking
about.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I propose to vote for this
measure because it will at least have an educational effect. If the farmers can show the
city people that they are wrong it will be all
well and good; if the city people can show the
farmers that they are wrong, that, too, will be
all well and good. The only way we can
learn who is right is to try it out all over
Canada from May 1 to November 1.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Will the city people try
out standard time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it will have to be
daylight saving. My honourable friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) reminds me of
the story Bryan told. He was asked whether
he was a farmer. He replied that he lived on
a farm-like my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)-but he said he
was an agriculturist. I am afraid that my
good friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) is an agriculturist-one who makes
his money in the city and spends it in the
country.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have not had any legislation on daylight saving since 1918, so I say
that we should try it out for the next year or
two, and if it does not prove satisfactory,
surely we shall have enough sense to
abandon it.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
the discussion so far has shown the importance of the motion now before this honourable
chamber. I think the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) should be complimented for introducing this subject, because
this is a very controversial question in the
minds of our people today.
It was not my intention to speak, but I
thought the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) made a rather severe attack, shall
I say, on the farmers, and I felt that I could
not allow his remarks to pass without comment. He has overlooked the fact that man
himself has caused the confusion by interfering with the laws of nature. For the most
part, city people are governed by the clock,

whilst the farmer may rise when he likes and
work as long as he likes, provided that nature
is taken into consideration. The farmer cannot get out in the field before the grass is dry;
he may arrange his hours as he sees fit, but he
must not ignore nature.
If we want uniformity, why not carry on
with the present system and let those who
want to start their day earlier do so. There is
nothing under the name of Heaven or on our
statute books to prevent them from doing
this. As a matter of fact, certain business
concerns today do start earlier in the morning
and quit earlier at night.
The honourable senator who introduced
this motion drew attention to the differences
of times in the matter of railway travel. May
I say that the confusion is much worse when
travelling by plane, say, from British Columbia to Ottawa. You leave on standard time
and you are only on the plane an hour when
you change your watch. You are continually
wondering whether you are on standard time,
daylight saving, Mountain time, and so on. If
we must make a change, why not make the
present time system uniform throughout? We
are more or less living by the clock, so we

I would point out to the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that the

has done a day's work before the man in the

SENATE
The practical objection to consideration of
legislation in Committee of the Whole arises
from the difficulty of getting clear answers to
questions. In order that clear and detailed
answers may be obtained in Committee of
the Whole, it is necessary that some official
sit in front of the member explaining the
measure and supply him with the required
information. That practice is followed in
the other place, but there is no provision for
it under our present rules. Under certain
circumstances I avail myself of the talent
around me and ask some honourable senator
to explain the principle of a bill on second
reading. If the senator is prepared to handle
the explanation without the assistance of
officials, the procedure is proper under our
rules. It is also workable in cases of legislation originating in the Senate. Under an
amendment to our rules, passed a year or
two ago, a minister representing his department may come to this house and participate
in a debate. That right applies to the minister only, and nobody representing him, may
appear in the house. For example, the present
Solicitor General when he was parliamentary
assistant, could not have appeared in this
chamber, but now that he has become a
minister he may appear. The question arises
whether it would be feasible to require an
honourable senator who explains legislation
to be so familiar with it as to be able to
answer any and all questions. For my part,
I would be reluctant to change our present
system.

As to legislation which does not originate
in this house, under no circumstances could a
minister or his assistant come into Committee
of the Whole and participate in the debate.
But following certain suggestions made to
me, I gave serious consideration to the question of whether or not the National Defence
Bill, which did originate in this house, and
which is now before a standing committee,
should have been submitted to Committee
of the Whole. I spoke to the Minister of
National Defence on this point, and he asked
me if that procedure would require him to
attend the meetings. In fairness I had to
admit to him that it would. Whether one
method would serve the interests of the
Senate as a whole better than the other is a
matter for personal judgment. I have an
open mind on the subject. But the system
whereby bills are referred to a standing committee-where, incidentally, both committee
members and others are allowed to ask questions direct-lhas been most satisfactory; and
no doubt that was one of the reasons why,
about three years ago, the number of members on each of our committees was materially
increased. For instance, the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, which four years

ago had no more than twenty or twenty-five
members, was enlarged to fifty, or about half
the total membership of this house, thereby
enabling more senators to participate as members in the work of the committee. Of course,
those who are not members are free to attend.
I do not think I can usefully add anything
more.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a supplementary question? Is it possible under our
rules, for any reason of policy, to submit a
bill first to a standing committee and then to
the Committee of the Whole?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, we can do that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would not that course
have both the advantages which the leader
has described?
Hon. Mr. Reid: My supplementary question
is, whether the evidence presented before the
various committees is taken down by shorthand reporters. If not, does the leader not
think it would be advisable that the rest of
us should know what is being done in those
committees?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Ordinarily there is no
verbatim record of the evidence, though on
particular occasions a stenographic report
may be requested, and ordered. Again I must
point out to honourable senators who are not
members of this or that committee, that,
althoulgh they may feel reluctant to attend,
their presence would be welcomed: there is
no reason in the world why they should not
come.
While I am not taking sides on this matter, I might observe to my honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
that a bill, even if it is considered in a standing committee and then referred to Committee of the Whole, must be piloted by somebody who is in a position to give informative
answers to those who were not at the meeting
of the standing committee. It is all very well
to have the right to ask questions, but one
cannot expect that many will be asked unless
reasonably satisfactory answers are to be
obtained in reply. At various times, when
honourable senators have asked me questions
about legislation, I have taken refuge in the
fact that I am not expected to know the
answers to all things, and that the information
will be forthcoming when the bills are sent
to committee. It will still be necessary to have
someone who is in a position to answer questions, and answer them at once, not next day
or at some later time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This subject has come up
quite often. Formerly I was a member of a
provincial legislature, and it was our practice
to go into Committee of the Whole on all
legislation. However, I admit that inuch of

NOVEMBER 23, 1949
the legislation which was so dealt with had to
do with subjects with which all of us were
more or less familiar.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has come here from
the other place, where he had much the same
experience, and where, in the case of important bills, I believe it is the practice to bring
in a resolution and have it considered in
Committee of the Whole. A lengthy discussion takes place on the resolution, then the
bill is given first and second readings and, if
it is felt necessary, is sent to committee. Let
us take, for example, the new Income Tax
Bill, which I think will require considerable
explanation. It is certainly a measure about
which every member and senator should be
fully informed when he goes back to his
constituents, because there is nothing that
makes the public so critical of a member or
senator as inability on his part to answer a
question about a bill which bas been before
parliament. Unless a bill is discussed in the
house itself or in Committee of the Whole,
all honourable senators may not know exactly
what it provides. It often happens that when
a bill is being discussed in committee some
honourable senators are unable to be present
because they are attending the meeting of
another committee. Before any honourable
senator explains a bill on second reading, I
think he should consult the officers of the
appropriate department, including the Minister, to learn all about the measure. le should
know the provisions of the legislation as
thoroughly as he would if he wanted to
explain it to a client or to a customer. Following his explanation on second reading, the
bill could be sent to a standing or special
committee, and our rules could be amended to
provide that when the bill is reported to the
house it shall be referred to the Committee
of the Whole. This would mean we would
have the advantage of the explanation given
on second reading, and the knowledge gained
by the members of the standing committees.
That is the real way to do it. But there is
another way which I strongly favour. I agree
with the leader opposite that no man except
a Minister has the privilege of coming to this
house to explain a bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You should say "no
person".
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said no person.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You said "no man".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, many books include
women when they refer to "mankind". In
any event, the important thing is that we
should all be fully informed about the bills
we pass. I have heard senators say: "I didn't
know that such and such was in the bill. I
wasn't on the committee, and I didn't hear
45785-221

it discussed in the house. If I had known what
was in the bill I would have objected to it".
This is understandable. If I were a stranger
sitting in the gallery listening to the debates
of this chamber, I would certainly think that
the members of the Senate never did anything. The truth is that they do magnificent
work in committee. I have never been in a
committee of any kind that was more
efficient than our standing committees,
where honourable senators discuss various
subject matters without a vestige of partisanship. But this good work does not corne
to the attention of the public. If we see one
stranger in one of our committee rooms we
rush over to find out who he is and what he
wants.
My honourable friend, from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) informed me that
he was going to introduce this question, so
I have had time to think about it. I discussed
this matter with him and another honourable
senator, and we all agreed that a measure of
such general interest as the Income Tax Bill
should be discussed in Committee of the
Whole. If our rules do not provide for it, I
am sure the bouse would consent to an experiment along this line, and we could amend
our rules next session. I feel that this would
be in the interest of all concerned, and in
this way the public would have a better
understanding of the work done by the
Senate.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I must say that I have a great deal of sympathy with the position taken by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid). I recall that when I was first
appointed to the Senate I was not a member
of any of the important committees. When
a committee presented a report on an
extremely important matter, it would be
accepted without discussion and the bill
would be read the third time. This meant
that those in my position would have little
knowledge about the provisions of the bill.
It seems to me that the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
made a suggestion which should be seriously
considered. In the handling of important
bills, would it not be wise to consider thern
in Committee of the Whole after they have
been returned to us from one of our standing
committees? Take, for example, legislation
such as the Income Tax Bill, which, as suggested by the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), is likely to be
before us in a few days. I rather think it is
essential that this legislation should first of
all be dealt with in a standing committee,
where the officials of the Income Tax
Departnent could explain exactly what was
meant by the various provisions; then after

SENATE
the report of that committee was presented
to the house, the bill could be dealt with section by section in a Committee of the Whole.
This would mean that all honourable senators, as well as the members of the standing
committee, would have an opportunity to
discuss the bill section by section, and the
members of the standing committee would
probably know most of the answers to the
questions asked by other members. I suggest
that this procedure would combine the
advantageous features of both the standing
committee and the Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
rule 72, page 27 of the Rules of the Senate
of Canada, already empowers us to sit as a
Committee of the Whole. I recall an occasion
when a motion was put that the bouse go into
Committee of the Whole to amend the
Criminal Code. At that time Senator Dandurand was leader of the government, and
on the second day of sitting as a Committee
of the Whole he had in front of his desk two
officers of the Department of Justice. Well,
the result was that I had an argument with
him that lasted for two days. On another
occasion when the honourable senator from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) was chairman
of the committee which was discussing superannuation we had two members of the Civil
Service Commission with us. In any event,
there is already a provision in our rule book
for sitting as a Committee of the Whole.
There is no question that honourable senators do a splendid job in their committees, but
as the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has pointed out, the public knows
nothing about it. When we do something
really worth while, as the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) knows, little
is heard about it.
It takes hard work and perseverance to
bring results; but I think you will find that
if we sit as a Committee of the Whole we
shall, as the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) has said, lose the opportunity of
hearing the various departmental officials.
In Committee of the Whole, they have to
communicate their answers to the leader here
who then reports them to the house. That
is an awkward system. On the other hand,
when a bill is before a standing committee
we can have the minister, the deputy minister
or any other departmental representative
present to give us whatever information we
require. My suggestion would be that we
make use of the rules that we already have.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question?
My honourable friend has referred to an
occasion when the honourable gentleman
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) was
present-

Hon. Mr. Marcotte: You were there too.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. On that occasion
I moved that the bill be considered in Committee of the Whole. At least, that is my
memory of how we got into Committee of the
Whole in that instance. My question is this:
after a bill has been reported from a standing
committee and before the motion is made
for third reading, is not any member entitled
to move that the bill be referred to the
Committee of the Whole?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then, is that not the
answer to the whole problem? If the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) or any other senator wishes to
have a bill considered in Committee of the
Whole, he may so move at the appropriate
time.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: The rules governing
procedure in Committee of the Whole are
Nos. 72 to 76, both inclusive.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
My good friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) was my schoolmate in another
place. I think I may put it that way, for
after all, public life in this parliament is a
grand school where we learn a lot about
human nature, human needs and human
remedies. If my honourable friend's suggestion is intended to make us better
acquainted with the bills that we consider
here, I am entirely in favour of it; but I
would be opposed to it if the purpose were
to get us more publicity. We, the elder
statesmen of the nation, should not emulate
the glamour girl.
After all, honourable senators, the role of
this house may be compared to that of a
Court of Appeal. At a trial before the court
of first instance-which in our province is
known as the Superior Court and, in other
provinces, as the Supreme Court-there is
a show. Witnesses are heard, lawyers clash
with one another over points of evidence
and law; and the trial, if it is one in which
the public are deeply interested, is given
a good deal of prominence in the press. If
the losing party is not satisfied with the
court's verdict or judgment, there is an appeal
to a higher court. A formal case is then
prepared, containing the pleadings and the
depositions of witnesses, and a copy of these
documents is furnished to each of the judges
on the Appellate Court. When that court
sits there is no show, and perhaps the newspapers do not even bother to tell their readers
when the court is hearing a case that
attracted much attention in the court of first
instance. The greater part of the Appellate
Court's work is done in a private chamber,

SENATE
In that spot, humble but with a wealth of
beauty, I learned to breathe the air of
freedom.
This was but a natural consequence, inasmuch as liberty had a traditional value in the
county of Charlotte. It was here, I believe,
that the first public pronouncement respecting the widest measure of freedom was first
written into the annals of this country. There
came indeed to our shores in 1783, as part
of the Loyalist migration, a certain body
known as "The Society of Friends". They
established a townsite which they called
Belle Veu, now known as the village of
Beaver Harbour. To the south and west of
this location they laid out their garden plots
or 10-acre lots, and to the north and east
their more ample farm lands. The latter
area was called Pennfield, in honour of the
leader whom they so assiduously followed.
Pennfield later came under world observation
owing to the fact that it was the natural
landing field upon which Mollison settled in
his west Atlantic flight. Also, it was the site
of one of Canada's greatest airports.
Having established their township, the
Society of Friends drew up a set of rules
and regulations for the personal conduct of
their members and for the conduct of their
public affairs. It is interesting to note that
the fourth item in their book of rules laid
down the mandate that no one could hold
lands, be a member of their society or enjoy
any of its privileges, who kept a slave under
any pretext whatever. This, I believe, was
the first pronouncement of its kind on the
North American continent.
In 1793, under Lord Simcoe in Upper
Canada, which later became the province
of Ontario, a similar measure of freedom was
given legislative authority. In 1801 Lower
Canada, now the province of Quebec passed
almost identical legislation. In 1833 owing
to the persuasion of Wilberforce and other
lovers of freedom, action along this line was
taken by the government of Great Britain.
After a period of internecine war and the
spilling of fratricidal blood, the American
Union adopted this principle in 1865.
To recapitulate and to make my point the
more evident; ten years before a wider freedom was proclaimed in what is now the
province of Ontario, eighteen years before
similar action was taken in what today
constitutes the province of Quebec, fifty
years before England became Christian in
practice, and a full eighty years before the
American Union subscribed to that principle
dear to every American heart-"Liberty and
union now and forever, one and inseparable"
-there was born in the little county of

Charlotte the spirit of emancipation. There
indeed we find the setting of that beautiful
American poem:
The moon saw, and the sea,
And the bounding aisles of the dim woods rang
to the anthems of the free.
Can one wonder, that I am interested in any
matter which pertains to liberty, and that I
have a special interest in human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
A declaration now on human rights and
fundamental freedoms would come, I believe,
at a most appropriate period in our history.
That great but unorthodox writer, Victor
Hugo, has stated somewhere
that the
twentieth century was to be the century of
man. He advised-and I quote him looselythat in this century we would see the cessation of wars and the end of feuds and passions, that territorial boundaries would be
eliminated, that much of the old order would
perish and even dogmas would die, but that
man would live. To him would be given
a greater territory, confined alone by world
limits, and a greater hope, limited only by
Heaven. Whether this writer was displaying
a special prescience or was over-optimistic
in his estimate, his stirring message nevertheless presents a challenge to us. In efforts
to meet this challenge, certain senators have
raised initial objections. They suggest that
those who "step the halberd o'er" are guilty
of idealism, of being premature in their
suggestions. and of ruthlessly trampling
provincial rights and privileges.
Let us first examine these objections. It
has been stated by one honourable senator
that the sentiments expressed in the resolution under discussion were too idealistic. I
cannot concede that sentiments of a lofty
character can ever be charged with this disability. On the contrary, every day in this
chamber I listen to the prayer which is read
for the benefit of members. Couched in the
choicest language, almost poetical in character, sublime in its beauty of thought and
expression, it requests that Providence
. . . may direct and prosper all our consultations
for the advancement of His glory, the safety,
honour and welfare of our Sovereign and this
country, that all things may be ordered and settled
by our endeavours upon the best and surest foundations, that peace and happiness, truth and justice,
religion and piety may be established among us for
all generations.

I do not know whether members listen to
this prayer with attention or not, and I am
uncertain whether they feel the need of it for

their direction, but I have never considered
it, by reason of its sublimity of thought, to
be too idealistic.
I have been informed that in the early
days of the world's history a prophet came

NOVEMBER 23, 1949
down from Mount Sinai with certain tablets
upon which were inscribed mandatory instructions for the guidance of men; I have also
been informed that throughout the years
many men on many occasions have fallen
short of a complete compliance with these
injunctions; but I have never heard it suggested that because they were written and
contained noble sentiments they were too
idealistic.
I trust that the objection raised on this
particular point will prove no barrier to
members in their hopes of eternal rest. I
make this suggestion in all sincerity, as the
place we all wish to attain, and which I hope
all members shall attain, has been described
as a place of supreme idealism.
At this point I might offer a consoling
thought to our Scottish friend, the junior
senator from British Columbia (Hon. Mr.
Reid). If he still entertains any fears of civil
or criminal action arising out of the skirl of
the pipes, may I out of the generosity of my
Irish heart offer him the harp.
Sorne Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The answer is, no.
Hon. Mr. Doone: It has been reputed,
honourable senators, to shed the soul of music.
As such it could be for him a constant and
agreeable companion, and I believe that when
his final hour comes he might take it with
him, inasmuch as it is the consensus of opinion
among all nations that this is the instrument
to which the angels sing. May I add for the
information of honourable senators that the
harp, which is as Irish as the glens of Antrim
or the hills of Armagh, was undoubtedly
selected as a heavenly instrument in tribute
to the drafting ground of so many divine
musicians.
The honourable senator advises that the
sentiments expressed were too idealistic.
May I inquire, was it idealism on the part
of Cobbett continually to remind the English
people that workhouses, treadmills, and poor
rates were not indispensable appendages to
society, and that a country to have the
elements and attributes of greatness should
not permit its old people to be dependent on
parochial relief, its citizens to be without
food to maintain health, and its orphan
children to live in brutal wretchedness? Was
it idealism when we advanced the thought
that the world could no longer view the problems of the underprivileged with complacency? Were we in this country too
idealistic when we laid down the proposition
that even the sordid incidents of life must
be viewed in their true light and with an
unhampered vision of sympathetic and intelligent understanding? Is it idealism to believe

that those affected by age, by widowhood, by
the suffering of disease are even as you and
I, that the gates of their souls lie free, and
that as heirs of the great resources of this
country they are entitled to common rights
and privileges?
As a counter-irritant to an argument of this
character, may I suggest that we should
examine most closely into the possible effects
of a too rigid adherence to the principles of
materialism. The later may present problems
which run deeper than their visible and most
apparent incidence. I noticed indeed two
years ago, and I presume conditions have not
changed to any great degree siñce then, a
press report of a Gallup poll, conducted in
Great Britain and Canada, as to what constituted happiness. The result of the poll was
both enlightening and astounding. It is submitted as follows:

Family life ......................
Sufficient money ................
Religion .........................

Great
Britain Canada
per cent per cent

19

May I say that if this expression of opinion
is truly representative and the figures obtained
indicate our concept of Canadian life, idealism
is long overdue, and no member of this
assembly could fail in righteousness in supporting idealistic principles.
Honourable senators, it has been suggested
that the motion is premature. What does
such a criticism entail? Certainly a criticism
of this character must be voiced without
recognition of conditions applying to the
broad field of human relations.
Let us' examine the facts. It is true that in
our troubled times we must anticipate certain
discomforts. We have been informed that,
"In the travail of the ages the birth of each
new era rings earth's systems to and fro".
This we know. We must also expect that
there will be certain dislocations in a transition period as the aftermath of war. However,
conditions today are far from normal expectations. It is not, as in the past, a resting period
before people move safely along orderly paths
in the pursuit of peace and happiness.
Unfortunately these goals seem remote and
unattainable.
We are counselled to regard action upon
our part as premature, whereas in other areas
moulders of thought and action appear
charged with the solemn duty of keeping
prejudice and mistrust alive rather than seeing how differences may be ended. Indeed,
day by day as the story of world passion
unfolds itself, thoughts of peace, fanned into
life by enthusiasm and wishful thinking, fade
and die in discouragement. The reaction is
not local or parochial, nor confined to a

SENATE
devastated Europe. From every corner of
the world people subjected to oppression are
calling for guidance.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) says we are premature. He says in effect that in a day of
landing fields we should be tied to the hitching posts of the past. Let us again examine
the moving tide of time. If we do so we will
realize that we are in one of the most critical
periods of the world's history; that we are
faced with one of the greatest disorganizations
of all time, the confusion of ideas and wants
as opposed to the confusion of tongues. We
are in a war of ideas for the destruction of
faith and those tenets which in the past have
held individuals and even nations to the
paths of rectitude. It is a war that promises
to be relentless, inasmuch as two dogmatic
forces can admit of no compromise or
appeasement. It is a war to the end, without
quarter and without cessation, until one or
other, the Christian or the Anti-Christian, has
been declared the victor. In this war any
participation on our part cannot be premature.
In this war-and this is total war, if ever
wars were total-there must be a full enlistment of our moral forces and a mass production of our faith. We must assemble the
thinking of right to oppose and neutralize the
promotion of wrong. We must, if we are ta
survive in our way of life, make men concious that under the banner of Christian
democracy lie their greatest need and their
greatest security.
The honourable senator says we are premature, that we are idealistic. In this crisis,
honourable senators, we must have in our
everyday life more thought and more fellowship-more Philip Sidneys ta recognize the
greater necessity, more Sydney Cartons to do
the better thing. I realize that this condition
is not easy of attainment. There is no popular
or easy way to security. There is no sedative
to still the ache of dissension. In this particular crisis even the tincture of time fails
in healing or curative properties.
Let us, honourable senators never entertain
the thought that the time is not ripe. That,
sirs, was the delaying cry when many of the
wants which for years had been longings of
the human heart were diagnosed as social ills,
and app.ropriate treatment was accorded.
Moreover, while present adjustments have
tended to the easement of social perplexities,
never let us believe that the horizon is clear,
that we can with security lower the periscope
of beneficial thinking and action. There are
large tasks in this world left for attentionthe crucial tasks of doing what society can
do to make life, in all its levels, happier,
easier and more satisfying. Let us rather be
confirmed in the belief that in our business

and social life we must have the intervention
of all those fine things in being-idealism,
justice, liberty, patriotism and moral nobility.
These things are never premature.
In no crisis can moral and ethical thinking
be regarded as iron rations to be held to the
last ditch and to the last dying hour. The
high achievements of fraternal effort, so evident in this world today, are opposed to the
theory of immaturity. Time rather is of the
essence. Let us give our declaration of faith.
It can do no possible harm. It may supply
the vitalizing force so necessary to stir
democratic peoples of the world to triumphant action. In looking down the long corridors of time, I can see many gaunt spectres
of the past, but for the future I can see no
corresponding horrors arising from idealism.
As another restraint, it has been objected
that the resolution before us is a violation
of provincial autonomy. Let us examine this
assertion. In all fairness, I can see a possible
conflict of thought, provided federal action
were taken without first having provincial
approval. I can also see the absurdity of
separate or local legislation as affecting
of
A certificate
citizenship.
Canadian
Canadian citizenship with an Ontario, Quebec
or Maritime badge would be the pinnacle of
folly. But, I cannot see how the submission
of a certain set of lofty ideals and noble
sentiments to provincial jurisdictions for
study, can hold any harmful properties. It
has been suggested by way of further reaction
that we are throwing the matter into the lap
of provincial leaders. That, honourable senalors, is not the method pursued in our cultured society. The proposal is to be submitted; not to be thrown around into laps, but
formally and politely to be placed before provincial delegates, for examination at their
leisure, in their own good time, and under the
scrutiny of their expert advisers. In this I
can see no violation of provincial autonomy,
but, conversely, a respectful observance of
provincial rights.
In the face of these circumstances the role
of Hamlet is out of character. We cannot
remain muffled in our mantles, seeing no good,
and observing the whole proposal with fearsome pessimism. Nor can we arrest communism, restore confidence and maintain
morals by clinging to the past as if it were
the Rock of Ages to which Christians cling
for salvation.
On the affirmative side, we all believe in
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Let
us say sa. We have a full knowledge of the
great upward struggle of man for recognition
of his importance as an individual. Let us
respect it. We know that in every age man
had his special value. In earlier times he was
placed upon the block, measured for his

NOVEMBER 23, 1949
efficiency, bought and sold. In that evolutionary period he had a value as a slave. We
also know that in all ages, but particularly
in the great era of industrial and commercial
expansion, man had a value as a worker. In
every age too, from the day of his first conflict to the last supreme test of nations, he had
a value as a fighter.
With the coming of more modern ideas, with
society softened no doubt by mutual sorrows,
man was given a value as a human being.
From this concept we are supplied with the
term "human values". We all believe in
human values implicitly.
We believe in the dignity of man. We
believe that man, irrespective of his origin,
his condition and his circumstances, is possessed of a soul fashioned in the likeness of
Divinity. We believe that irrespective of
men's height or weight or stature, their souls
are all of one size. We question the uncertain
and variable qualities of good intention. We
therefore believe in giving common and legal
rights to all members of society. Let us make
this declaration of faith.
We feel that every individual should have
the right to think and to speak and to act
within the law according to his conscience.
Let us, therefore, make an open avowal of
our belief in this trinity of freedom. We are
opposed to enslavement and oppression and
inequality. May we not, therefore, give voice
to the sentiments contained in that comprehensive prayer for peace, the elevation of
right over might, the substitution of justice
for injustice and the promotion of charity over
selfishness?
We believe that every individual should
have a share in the gifts of Providence, in the
earth and its profits, in the rays and the heat
of the sun, in the rain from heaven. We
believe, in fact, that the God of heaven is the
God of all, and not alone of the few and the
privileged. May we not offer this consoling
thought to the people of our country?
We are opposed to the ancient, but not too
ancient, policy which denied to men the
profession of their faith, that drove clergymen
into the swamps and the caves and the forests,
that raised them to scaffolds of fame for practising their missions of mercy, that robbed
men of their titles and their lands and their
right to the franchise for conscience sake, that
drove the non-conformist to foreign lands and
to this country for freedom to worship. This
is fundamental.
We are opposed to the ancient, but not too
ancient, policy that denied to men the right
to teach and to children the right to learn, that
dismantled factories, stified industry, and
deprived labour of gainful employment, that
devised laws for the starvation of men, that

condemned them to die by the roadside, or
to embark in fever-ships, where they perished
by thousands. We remember these things,
not necessarily with bitterness, but with
caution; and remembering them we should,
in our legislation, display a breadth of vision
and outlook, and offer to our people in ample
declaration a high degree of sympathetic
understanding.
We are opposed to the ancient, but not too
ancient, policy of mass production, with its
sweat shops, its low wages and standards of
living, its hunger and tattered children, its
filth and its slums. We are opposed to the
newer system of mass idleness, with its
hunger and want in the midst of plenty. May
we not give to this belief a definite and legal
assurance?
We believe in the manumission of labourin fair wages for employees, in protection to
workmen against the hazards of their trade
and calling, in better factory and working
conditions and in a high measure of collective
bargaining. May we not give confirmation of
this belief in a sincere and a wholehearted
manner?
We believe in health; our ideas respecting
health are democratic. We believe in health
in all classes of society. We believe in health,
from both an economic and a humanitarian
point of view. We believe in youth. It is
our belief that upon the youth of this country
its future must depend. Believing in youth
as the rock and foundation upon which the
future must be built, we should make appropriate provisions. Denying nothing to the
rich, we should give to the poor comparable
advantages. Should we not make a public
pronouncement of this principle and give to
youth a full assurance?
We are opposed to the ancient, but not too
ancient, policy of having the poor and underprivileged dependent upon charity. It is our
belief that charity is sometimes cold, but at
all times uncertain. Having this belief, we
feel that science should ferret out every
inequality; that it should trace man's physical
and social ills; teach him how to protect himself in his particular niche in society, in his
health, his education, and his civic rights;
should assist him in maintaining a position
of security in his work and in his labours,
and grant to him a measure of independence
in his ageing hours.
It is our belief that the promoters of prejudice and the forces of disunity, which in the
past have played an important part in the
structural life of this country, will pass away,
but that truth will prevail and will live forever. We believe that where truth shines the
flame of justice will never die. Our faith
is not placed in material things. "The worm

SENATE
whose epoch is an hour" teaches us the
futility of contrary thinking. Our faith is in
Providence, and with our faith so founded
we believe in the future of this country and
the future of the world.
May we not, without incurring charges of
immaturity and idealism, place these ideas
before the people of our country as being matters of common and legal right, as part and
parcel of their fundamental freedoms?
Honourable senators, may I at this stage
put the record straight. May I make it crystal
clear that I am not so imbued with idealism
as to believe that if there were a full implementation of this resolution-that is, a writing
of every single feature of it into the constitution of our country-we would have a fulfilment of Hugo's prophecy, a termination of
feuds and passions, and the dismantling of
territorial barriers. Nor am I so idealistic as
to infer that if every unit forming part of the
United Nations were to subscribe to these
principles there would be written into world
history the epitaph of war.
I am not so fanciful as to presume that, if
all nations of the world were to accept at the
present time the ideas contained in the proposed bill of rights, we could give an assurance that never again would the field of
Flanders prove the battlefield of time nor its
winding rivers run red. Watching this world,
as all senators have, through the latticework
of recurring war, with sacrifice following
sacrifice in tragic sequence, I would wish ta
give this assurance to the youth of this
country and to so reassure the mothers of
men. But I am not sufficiently sanguine to
believe that a profession of faith would have
such saving and curative qualities, though
I do believe it would help. Certainly there
must be some value in an educational policy.
Otherwise we have lived our lives in stupid
futility. There must be some virtue in propaganda, otherwise for ages we have magnified its vices. If propaganda has no value
as a factor in influencing public opinion, either
for good or for bad, then for years we have
been listening to fairy tales of the subversive
qualities of the "isms" of Europe.
However, this is not the point at issue. We
are not at the moment concerned with accomplished facts, or whether the proposed bill
of rights meets with the unqualified approval
of this assembly. All that is suggested by the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) is that his resolution on Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms be referred
to the delegates at the forthcoming DominionProvincial Conference for study. The resolution does not contemplate an immediate

refiection of opinion, but is designed to promote on their part a skilled and considered
appraisal.
The honourable senator for Toronto-Trinity
holds the view that a study of this character
might be fruitful and have an educational
and inspirational value. I can see no valid
reason for killing such an idea with the dead
hand of time. Rather, may we not trust that
the study of its terms, and its possible
acceptance, may offer to us and to our time
a new and abiding faith, with our hopes for
the future more firmly implanted in a richer
field of understanding? May we not also
trust, even if in the past we have been
touched by the airs of adversity, that from
such a study and possible acceptance, given
world wide application, we can cherish the
hope that the future may hold for us fairer
winds and safer havens, and that to some
degrce at least peace and contentment may
settle in distracted areas, and that under
the guidance of Him who in the past has
always risen superior to darkness and to
death, there may be a levelling of the valleys
of doubt and negation-their hills laid low
and His justice made manifest.
As a parting and I hope an inspiring word,
may I, honourable senators, offer to you an
extract from Drinkwater's modern poetical
prayer, couched in the following terms of
eloquence and charm:
wTe know the paths wherein our feet should press,
Across our hearts are written Thy decrees.
Yet now, O Lord, be merciful to bless
With more than these.
Grant us
Grant us
Grant us
steel,
To strike

the will to fashion as we feel,
the strength to labour as we know,
the purpose, rimmed and edged with
the blow.

Knowledge we ask not-knowledge Thou hast lent.
But, Lord, the will- there lies our bitter need,
Give us to build above the deep intent
The deed, the deed.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
before moving the adjournment of the debate,
may I have the indulgence of the bouse to
make an explanation? Apropos of the explanation, I wish to thank the speaker who
has just taken his seat for his eloquent,
forceful and inspiring address, and for the
lofty sentiments which he bas expressed.
I propose to close this debate, as I have
the right to do, some time next week. In
the meantime I would ask that it be allowed
to stand in my name from day to day. Should
any other honourable senator wish to speak
I shall, of course make way for him. I move
the adjournment of the debate.

The motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck was agreed
to, and the debate was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before moving the adjournment of the house,
I wish to draw the attention of the honourable senator from South Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Gladstone) to what I think he may
already know, that copies of the Votes and
Proceedings are filed each day in the looseleaf volumes in our desks. Whether or not
additional copies are available, I do not
know. Perhaps honourable senators would
prefer to receive this document through the

mail rather than at their desks. I would
therefore ask honourable senators to give
the matter some consideration, and I shall
be happy to follow whatever they consider
the more desirable practice.

COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 144, an Act to amend the
Combines Investigation Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators will recall that before moving the
adjournment of the house on Thursday last
I indicated that if by this evening certain
bills from the other place were before us I
would ask leave to proceed to second reading
tonight. As regards three of the measures to
come before us this evening, I understand
that the honourable senators who were kind
enough to undertake to explain two of them
would like to proceed tomorrow; as to the
third, which was initiated in the Senate, I
propose to deal with it tomorrow.
The present bill, copies of which honourable senators will find on their desks, is
designed to facilitate enforcement of the
Combines Investigation Act and of related
provisions of the Criminal Code. The amendments proposed would affect some of the procedural and evidentiary rules applicable to
prosecutions under this legislation.
The introduction of amending legislation
at this time has been made necessary by the
uncertainty resulting from the decision of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in February, 1949,
in the dental supplies case. The problem
created by this decision has been studied most
carefully by law officers of the Department
of Justice, and by legal advisers, and the
present bill represents the results of that
study. The most important provision in the
bill is to be found in section 3, which deals
with the principal points of difficulty in the
dental supplies case-proof of authority of
company officials, and admissibility of company and other records.
Sections 1 and 2 of the bill affect the
procedure to be followed in prosecutions
under the Combines Investigation Act. Section 1 would give the Attorney General of
Canada equal status with an attorney general
of a province in initiating and conducting

combines prosecutions. This would confirm
formally the de facto situation already existing. Under the Criminal Code only the attorney general of a province has status to present
an indictment. Since for some time it has
been the practice for the Attorney General of
Canada to take responsibility in major combines prosecutions, this amendment is
designed to give him equal status with an
attorney general of a province without
excluding the latter.
Section 2 recognizes that jury trial of complex business offences of this type is usually
inappropriate, and would provide that the
corporations charged with such offences shall
be tried without a jury. The right of an
individual to elect either jury or non-jury
trial is not affected. Trials of offences of
this type are usually lengthy and involved.
Typical recent trials have required the taking
of as much as 8,000 pages or more of transcript and the filing of over 1,000 exhibits,
and have necessitated over 50 days of trial.
The principle of trial by a jury of one's peers
has hardly any logical application to the
relatively modern development of trial of
corporations on indictment, since a corporation by its very nature cannot really be so
tried.
It is expected that these amendments, if
approved by parliament, will do much to
overcome the principal difficulties recently
experienced in the enforcement of the Combines Investigation Act. If the competitive
system is to produce the full benefits of free
enterprise to which the public is entitled,
there must be effective means to deal
with combinations or monopolies which place
undue restraints upon trade. It is necessary
to ensure, as far as possible, by the amendments now proposed that they be effectively
applied. Enforcement of the legislation when
offences have been alleged is a matter for the
courts. It is essential, therefore, to provide
that evidence may be obtained and put before
the courts in a manner which will ensure full
consideration.
While this bill refers to only a few phases
of the Combines Investigation Act, I cannot
help feeling that as time goes on the question of price levels will become of increasing
interest to the great majority of Canadian
consumers.
There seems to be an ever-increasing body
of the public which believes that a whole
range of capital and consumer goods produced
in this country is sold to Canadian Consumers
on a price basis much in excess of corresponding prices in, say, the United States.
Whether or not this higher price basis is
achieved by methods that can be successfully
challenged in the courts as being in the

SENATE

restraint of trade, is debatable; but the
impact on the consumer's standard of living
is the same. It is possible, and indeed probable, that, to the extent that it exists, much
of it is due to the incidence of protective
tariffs; and the freedom from outside competition secured thereby is in no wise diminished as a result of the extraordinary action
that had to be adopted-an exchange conservative measure-to control United States'
imports. It behooves business and industry
to examine their position in this matter with
a critical eye, and to put their own bouse in
order to the extent that abuses exist.
In recent years there has been a veritable
flood of propaganda extolling the 'advantages
of free enterprise and competition in achieving an ever-higher standard of living for all.
Any actions by business that smatter of
restraint of trade internally, or vehement
protests against the slightest competition
from without, at once give colour to the idea
that business has gone soft as a result of
over ten years of virtual freedom from
competition, and that some at least of those
who proclaim most loudly the benefits of
competition to our way of life, are the first
to endeavour to see that it does not exist
in their own particular businesses.
It would be most unfortunate if this idea
became wide-spread.
I can think of no
better argument for state ownership than an
example such as this. A particular business
is a monopoly. It is charging the consumer
all the traffic will bear. It has succeeded in
putting itself beyond the reach of the law,
and has been able to protect itself against
outside competition. If it is not to be subject to competition now or hereafter, why not
have the state take over?
In all probability, thinking along this line
had something to do with action of the
Province of Ontario years ago in taking over
the generation of hydro electric energy in
that province as a state monopolyHon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: -as well as with subsequent developments in this very city of
Ottawa, for instance, whereby the ownership
and operation of the street railway and the
distribution of electric energy have both been
taken over by the city.
I have not the slightest doubt that part of
the consideration which has prompted
Western Europe and the United Kingdom, as
well as many other countries, to take over
more and more, as state monopolies, various
activities which hitherto have been in the
hands of private enterprise, has been the
belief, right or wrong, that the public were
being unfairly treated in the matter of the
cost of goods and services.

Only recently, as an indirect result of the
prevailing opinion with respect to price levels
of the products of secondary industries in
Canada, there have been interesting developments. Until comparatively recent times a
large number of people in Canada, particularly those engaged in primary industries
such as agriculture and fishing, have vigorously opposed existing price levels of the
products of secondary industry in Canada,
attributing them variously to the effect of
combines and protective tariffs. For themselves, they were unable to organize sufficiently to effectively control the price levels
of the commodities which they produced, but
they have now demanded governmental action
which would accomplish the same result.
We have in existence now, and it may well
continue in some form or another for some
time to come, a program of support of the
price levels of primary products to ensure
to the producers what they feel is a relatively fair return for the results of their
industry. The effect of this particular course
is that their activities have now been concentrated on the maintenance of their own
price levels, rather than on the reduction of
price levels of things they purchase. Under
the conditions which have existed during
recent years this has apparently achieved a
degree of stability which has, until the present at least, resulted in great prosperity for
all concerned. I should not care to hazard
an opinion as to whether or not the maintaining of price levels for all products, both
primary and secondary, will continue to be
an important part of our economy in the
future; but if it is, it seems inevitable that
some careful consideration will have to be
given by someone as to the relative price
level in Canada as compared with that in
other countries where similar conditions
exist. That will be particularly important
for a country like Canada, which depends to
such a large extent on export trade, for
whatever other benefits accrue, if the over-all
price level is too high we might find ourselves priced out of the markets on which we
have to compete.
Whatever policy may be adopted in the
future, an informed public opinion is one of
the prime requirements. I have always felt
-and I can express only a personal opinionthat some consideration might be given to
having the Bureau of Statistics, which supplies us with a veritable fund of information
on all conceivable matters, address itself to
the problem of supplying the public generally with authoritative information about the
prices paid by consumers in Canada for a
wide range of ordinary purchases. This would
enable the consumers to see at a glance what
they are called on to pay, in their respective
parts of Canada for various articles, as com-

NOVEMBER 29, 1949

pared with prices in other parts of the country, and in other countries as well, if it were
possible to get the necessary information.
I am ready to concede that the vast mai ority
of those engaged in business enterprises in
Canada not only believe in free competition
but are quite willing to practise it. A great
responsibility rests on them to make sure that
an unscrupulous minority is not enabled to
put into effect practices which may ultimately
not only bring about the downfall of that
minority, but play a part in pulling down the
whole structure of private enterprise.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before I proceed to discuss the subject-matter
of the bill I may say that I expected my
honourable friend the leader of the government to give some reason why the recent
report made by Mr. McGregor was not tabled
in the house, as is required by law. Apparently he thought the matter had been sufficiently discussed in the other place. Al I
wish to say in this respect is that any law
passed by parliament which is not obeyed
by the government is not of much use.
The people of Canada no doubt got a dreadful shock when they learned, a month or so
ago, that the report of an investigation under
this Act had not been tabled in accordance
with the requirements of the law. Knowing,
as I do, the minister in charge of the department concerned, and having sat with him in
a provincial legislature for many years, I was
particularly shocked. The government alone
is to blame for the incident. It is a bad start.
The laudable purpose which my honourable
friend mentioned for amending the Act at
this time is all to the good, but it does not
mean anything unless the government will
carry out the law. I do not intend to discuss
the matter further, because it has been fully
debated in another place and the public are
well seized of the facts.
As to the bill itself, I can see no objections.
I think a good many lawyers would agree
with me that the dental case was, to say the
least, badly handled. The passage of this
measure may make it easier for the government to get a conviction where there are
grounds for it. But I am bound to say that
if I were a solicitor for people suspected of
being involved in a combine, I do not think
we would have anything in writing. I can
see no reason for it. My experience with
business people has taught me that there is no
more dishonesty in big business than there is
in any other kind of business. One finds
people in every walk of life with a complex
for dishonesty. We of the legal profession

think we are the salt of the earth-that
honesty begins and ends with us-but I have
never met anybody whoHon. Mr. Euler: Would agree with you?
Hon. Mr. Haig: -who would not say, "That
fellow is a lawyer, so keep your eye on him".
People say that about lawyers generally, but
they usually wind up with the remark, "Of
course the gentleman that acts for me is
absolutely straight and can be depended on".
This bill is really one for the lawyers, and
the provisions appear to be in order.
I was very pleased to hear the honourable
leader, in the latter part of his address,
mention the subject of electricity. Why did
the province of Quebec take over the supplying of electricity in Montreal and other
places? The answer is that the government
of Canada taxes private corporations in that
type of business, but does not tax governmentowned corporations. Why do the provinces
choose to go into the liquor business? There,
again, government bodies are not taxed, as
are private businesses. It is all an attempt to
dodge taxation. With our present system of
taxation governments will soon have practically confiscated everything above the
ordinary wage earnings of the individual.
The federal government recently suggested
a system for the muncipal taxation of government-owned properties in different places, but
they so arranged it that practically no taxes
will be paid. Only where the assessment on
government-owned property exceeds 4 per
cent of the total assessment does the municipality receive any contribution from the
government. Under that arrangement the city
of Winnipeg, for instance, will not benefit.
The people of this country are gradually
being taken over by the government, through
its system of taxation.
The province of Manitoba is keenly alive
to this question of the distribution of electrical power. We who live in that province
have cheap power, and the service is being
extended to farmers all over the province.
The reason we are able to extend the service
is that the Dominion does not tax the enterprise. Because of the burden of taxation and
the consequent difficulty of getting capital
and operating profitably, private enterprise
will not go into such a venture.
The honourable leader spoke about subsidies-I think he used the words "support
prices". Well, last year we put a support
price under potatoes. Now I do not want to
start a quarrel with my honourable friends
from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Leger) and
Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) but
we in the West took a real beating on potatoes last year. Up to the end of March we had

SENATE

lost nearly half a million dollars on a million
dollar investment. Regardless of what the
honourable leader says, I believe this country
cannot maintain subsidies on primary
products. It may be done for a year or two
when the terrific taxation brings in lots of
money, but when we get down to a true basis
of trading we cannot afford them. How could
we put a support price under wheat? Last
year the West had a light crop-only about
327 million bushels-but with an average
crop of say 500 million bushels, how could
we ever arrange a support price for that
product? The price has to find its own level.
If we are not going to put a support price
under wheat, then why put it under poultry,
eggs, potatoes, honey, or any other primary
product. Great Britain has been trying to
subsidize her producers, and she has gone
broke. The United States under a subsidizing
plan buys up grain, catitle and other commodities at a fixed price. It is estimated that
by the end of next June that country will
be in debt to the extent of 5, billion dollars
above the current taxation for the year.
I have no objection to an attack on combines, if they exist in this country, but I wish
to say a few words on behalf of Canadian
businessmen. It may not be good politics to
say it, but in my judgment it makes good
sense. Canada is fortunate in her businessmen, whether they be in agriculture or forestry, fisheries or manufacturing. They stand
up well in comparison with men of all other
walks of life. It is the insidious witch-hunting threat contained in the Combines Investigation Act that is objectionable. Somebody
gets the idea that he is paying too much for
a certain commodity, and an investigation
is started; but when the cost of labour,
freighit and taxation are considered it is
frequently found that the profit is not
excessive.
For many years there has been an attempt
by certain groups to drive out small competitors. If this proposed measure will curtail
the operations of such groups, I am all for it.
The little man who is just starting up must
be given a chance. I have heard of cases
where big business has eut the price at which
the small operator musit sell his commodity,
just in order to put him out of business. As
I say, I am in favour of curtailing such
activities, but let us not be carried away by
the witch-hunting that is practised in some
other countries. I can remember only two
or three cases where an investigation under
the Combines Act amounted to anything.
It is easy to assert that a combine exists;
but what is the test? The legal profession
has a tariff of charges: does that make it a
combine? Go into any law office in Winnipeg,
and you will be charged $7 for what in

Manitoba is called a transfer; in Ontario and
most other provinces it is known as a deed.
All lawyers make the same charge. In lawsuits the charges are regulated through a
tariff prepared by members of the Bench
and Bar. Sometimes it is very hard to distinguish between a lawful combination and
a combination in restraint of trade; and it is
important that legislation of this kind, of
itself or in the administration of it, shall not
promote witch-hunting and discourage lawful
business enterprise. I have wondered in the
last year or two why so little money is going
into enterprise. People will buy bonds and
mortgages, but the problem today is to get
new money into business. Perhaps-I do not
know-one of the reasons is the kind of
threat implied in this legislation.
I have no objection to the bill. It is
intended to facilitate prosecutions by the
Attorney-General of Canada apart from
action by provincial attorneys-general.
It
will facilitate proof of the offence, if an
offence has been committed, and there are
other useful provisions. It does not seem to
me that the bill is of any great importance,
however, and I do not see any need of sending it to committee, though I have no objection, if that be the wish of honourable
members.
Hon.

Arthur

W.

Roebuck:

Honourable

senators, I should like to say a word in connection with this bill. In the first place let
me thank the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for his excellent
address and the soundness of his remarks
about combines generally. I think I can
assure him that every member of this house
agrees heartily with his general observations
as to the necessity of probing combinations
which operate unduly in restraint of trade.
I think the answer to what the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
said with regard to distinctions between one
party and another in the matter of the fixing
of prices lies in the fact that the Code refers
not to restraint on trade but to undue
restraints on trade. The difficulty, of course,
is to decide what is an undue restraint.
I wish to refer to this bill because it seems
to me that so far the real pith and substance
of the measure has been scarcely mentioned.
The clause to which the honourable senator
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) drew
attention, extending the rights of a provincial
attorney-general to the Attorney-General for
Canada, is all right, but of very little importance. The provision that the case shall be
tried by a judge without a jury, unless an
individual is charged, makes little change in
the actual practice, because if I am rightand I hope I shall be corrected if I am notall or nearly all charges of this nature in the

NOVEMBER 29, 1949
past have been tried by judges and not by
juries. When a case was not properly submissible to a jury, the judge struck out the
jury.
The real teeth of this bill are in the last
section; and I think the house should realize
what it is doing when it passes this particular
measure. The section is somewhat detailed,
but I do not think the house will regard that
as an objection: it is largely in its definitions
that it is important.
39A. (1) In this section
(a) "agent of a participant" means a person who
by a document admitted in evidence under this
section appears to be or is otherwise proven to be
an officer, agent, servant, employee or representative of a participant.

You will see that agency is extended
somewhat beyond its meaning in common
law, and that it depends too upon subsequent
paragraphs, to which I shall refer.
(b) "document" includes any document appearing to be a carbon, photographic or other copy of
a document.

That is not important.
(c) "participant" means any accused and any
person who, although not accused, is alleged in the
charge or indictment to have been a co-conspirator
or otherwise party or privy to the offence charged.

In other words, a participant is anyone
mentioned as having any part in the offence.
Having settled in this very broad manner
who a participant is, and who the agent of a
participant is, the bill provides in subsection 2:
(2) In a prosecution under section thirty-two of
this Act or under section four hundred and ninetyeight or section four hundred and ninety-eight A
of the Criminal Code:
(a) anything done, said or agreed upon by an
agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed
to have been done, said or agreed upon, as the case
may be, with the authority of that participant.

It is a general principle under English law
that a man is innocent until he is proved
guilty; and the burden is on the Crown to
show that one who is charged with an offence
committed by an agent authorized that agent
to commit the offence. If this bill should
pass, the burden will be switched, because
the fact that an agent bas done something
for one of these participants is now deemed
to be prima facie evidence that the participant
authorized the doing of it, although there is
no evidence before the court to that effect;
and the participant is under the obligation
to prove his innocence before his guilt has
been shown.
I pass to the next paragraph:
(b) a document written or received by an agent
of a participant shal prima facie be deemed to have
been written or received, as the case may be, with
the authority of that participant; and
(c) a document proved to have been in the
possession of a participant or on premises used or
occupied by a participant or in the possession of an

agent of a participant shall be admitted in evidence
without further proof thereof and shall be prima
facie evidence-

of all those things that I will now enumerate:
(i) that the participant had knowledge
document and its contents.

of the

That is, because it is found in his premises
or in the possession of an "agent", as "agent"
is described.
(ii) that anything recorded in or by the document
as having been done, said or agreed upon by any
participant or by an agent of a participant was
done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where
anything is recorded in or by the document as
having been done, said or agreed upon by an agent
of a participant, that it was done, said or agreed
upon with the authority of that participant.

Are we not going pretty far?
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Is a definition given of a
"participant"?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. I read that before
I came to these sections. I shall read it
again.
"participant" means any accused and any person
who, although not accused, is alleged in the charge
or indictment to have been a co-conspirator or
otherwise party or privy to the offence charged.

That is, a charge may be laid against A
of having conspired with B, who is not
charged with having committed an offence.
Therefore, not only A, against whom the
charge has been laid, but also B, who is
alleged to have been in some way a party
or privy to the offence, is a "participant".
The third condition under which the section operates is as follows:
that the document, where it appears to have
been written by any participant or by an agent of
a participant, was so written and, where it appears
to have been written by an agent of a participant,
that it was written with the authority of that
participant.

Honourable senators, as I say, the fundamental rule in prosecutions of this kind,
which are essentially criminal, is that the
Crown carries the responsibility and burden
of bringing home to the accused the actual
knowledge of participation in or commission
of the offence, and not until the Crown bas
proved these things is the accused put on his
defence. Unfortunately, however, incidents
of this kind are rather too frequent in
modern law. We are changing the ancient
custon, and making a document which is
found on the premises of a participant or
accused-or in the hands of somebody who,
according to this formula, becomes an agent
at law of the accused-evidence against the
accused and prime facie evidence that he
had knowledge of the document, authorized
its contents and was guilty of the things
recorded in the document.
Honourable senators, I feel that I can
make these remarks as well as any member

SENATE
of this chamber without risk of being accused
of siding with the combines. I do not think
anybody would accuse me of that. Thirty
or more years ago I represented the province
of Ontario, as its counsel, in the prosecution
of the alleged wholesale groceries combine
in the city of Toronto. For three solid years
I fought that battle, with very unsatisfactory
results. I have sympathized with Mr.
McGregor in the important public service
he has carried on over the years, because I
have known from personal experience some
of the difficulties with which he has been
confronted. I know that in my case it seemed
to me that every man's hand was against
me, because the accused were highly respectable gentlemen. Anybody who attempts the
prosecution of substantial business will find
against him all others in like case, and he
will indeed have to possess a firm loyalty
to the general public to sustain him in the
adversities and discouragements he will meet
on his way.
As I say, I am sure that no one will accuse
me of being on the side of the combines, and
yet I view with some little concern his
violation of the usual principle, this relieving the Crown of its customary obligation
when attacking an accused person, this
switching of the onus of proof in this way.
It may be that it will work out all right,
because frequently a doubtful law proves
good in practice when applied, operated and
administered by good men. On the other
hand, good laws can be poorly administered
by bad men. Therefore, if the power that
we are placing in the hands of those who
will conduct these prosecutions is used with
a full knowledge of its unusual character,
with due reserve and with an eye to justice
rather than success, it may be that it will
assist, at least in some cases, in bringing to
book those who are guilty of the important
offences mentioned in the Combines Investigation Act and in the Criminal Code. But
should it fall into the hands of unscrupulous
people, or men who are too anxious to succeed
in a prosecution, it may be the subject of
some abuse.
I am not opposing this measure, I am only
discussing it. I am sure we are all satisfied
with the unimportant sections; but we should
realize that the bill itself is changing one
of the fundamentals of criminal law which
has been thought in the past to be necessary
for the protection of accused persons, and
it is putting a heavy onus of proof upon
those who, perhaps, are unfortunate in being
accused in these matters. It may be said, of

course, that these gentlemen may take the
witness box and clear themselves after the
prima facie evidence has thrown the burden
of proof onto their shoulders; I only suggest
that we should clearly understand and
thoroughly consider what we are doing in
this particular.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, a moment ago, our friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) remarked how difficult
it was to decide just where combines started.
It is sometimes very difficult to prove how
certain groups may get together. There is
another monopoly which goes far beyond the
one to which this legislation applies; it is the
monopoly which starts with production, goes
on to the manufacturing and processing and
finally reaches the consumer through distribution. Are examples needed? The milling
industry today controls a large number of
bakery and pastry concerns and will tomorrow
control them even more closely.
Thus is it possible to control prices from
the producer to the consumer. Under such a
system, all our small bakers will disappear,
and with them true competition.
Take the Unilever Company, which controls
80 per cent of the vegetable oils the world
over and holds the almost exclusive monopoly
of margarine. Not a single small soap manufacturer in Montreal, Quebec or Toronto can
buy the oils he needs unless he does so
through either one of the two world soap
monopolies, Unilever or Procter and Gamble.
I am not claiming that these people exact
exorbitant prices from the consumer, but they
do restrict initiative and destroy free enterprise.
Let us hope that the amendments proposed
today will not become a piece of legislation
which is not applied, but that they will be
used efflciently.
There are certain things, I admit, which
small concerns cannot accomplish; a small
blacksmith, for instance, could not have built
the Quebec bridge. One must not exaggerate,
but when large centralizing organizations
such as the ones I have mentioned determine
beforehand the salaries of the producers and
the distributors, and the price to the consumer,
I feel things are going a bit far and that free
enterprise no longer exists. That is what has
happened in the case of margarine, where a
world monopoly controls prices from the very
beginning.
I could give several other examples right
here in our own country. I could even mention the American monopoly of maple products, which existed twenty-five years ago.
Today, thanks to co-operation, half a dozen

NOVEMBER 29, 1949
buyers compete freely and everyone, from
producer to consumer, is more satisfied.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. I will ask that
it be set down for second reading on
Thursday next.

PRIZE WINNING GRAIN
FELICITATIONS TO GROWERS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I should like to draw the attention of the
house to the fact that quite recently a great
honour has been won by a grain grower in
the Rosetown district of the province of
Saskatchewan.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That gentleman won the
world's first prize for rye, not only at Toronto
but also at Chicago, and he is now known as
the World Rye King.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is his name?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: His name is Albert
Kessel.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a good name.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Mr. Kessel resides on
a farm about twenty miles from the town of
Rosetown, in a district which ordinarily is
not renowned for the growing of rye, though
it is famous for its wheat. He specializes
in the growing of wheat, rye and flax, and
at the North Battleford fair, which was held
shortly before the fairs at Toronto and
Chicago, he won the first prize in every one
of the seed grain classes that he entered.
Mr. Kessel is one of our new Canadians.
He came from Europe to the United States,
first, and then to Saskatchewan. He served
in the Canadian Army throughout World War
I, and on his return from overseas took up
the farm which he still operates, in a district
known as the Eagle Hills. It is on highway
No. 4, and as you go by it, along the edge of
the hills, you see a sign "Vimy Ridge Farm".
I think we should offer our congratulations
to this young man for what he has done in
developing a better quality of rye.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: And although British
Columbia is not known as a wheat producing
province, a lady farmer out there was

awarded at Chicago the first prize for seed
wheat. She is Mrs. Amy Grace Kelsey, of

TRANS-CANADA HIGHWAY BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 194, an Act to encourage
and to assist in the construction of a TransCanada Highway.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: For the information
of the bouse, I should say that this bill and
others in which you will be asked to concur
will be presented this afternoon. I am not
ready to proceed with the other bills, but I
am prepared to go ahead with this bill, and
am asking the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) to explain it.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding to explain the various provisions of
the bill, I should like to make a few remarks
about the agitation which bas taken place
over the years for a trans-Canada highway.
As a former member and as present chairman of our Standing Committee on Tourist
Traffic, I have become familiar with this agitation. I would say that at almost every session the matter of a trans-Canada highway
was presented to us by tourist authorities who
argued that in the interests of Canada's tourist trade it was highly important that there
should be a highway from the far eastern
part of the country to the extreme west.
That viewpoint bas been held, not only by
tourist traffic advocates, but also by many
other organizations throughout the country. I
would say that there is a unanimous opinion
in Canada in favour of a trans-Canada highway, not only for the purpose of promoting
tourist traffic but also for bringing closer
together the people of the various parts of
Canada. We know that people in eastern
Canada who wish to go into western Canada
by automobile are required to travel a considerable distance through the United States.
They cannot pass from Ontario-at least not
very comfortably-into Manitoba. They have

to cross the American border and proceed to
a point south of Winnipeg and then move
over into Manitoba. Even then they cannot
travel on a highway that is attractive to
tourists. Therefore, the measure now before
us is the beginning of an objective of many
organizations and of the people of Canada in
general.
I feel that the trans-Canada highway will
be very helpful in building up a better understanding between all parts of Canada, because
it will enable all motor-minded citizens to
move from one part of Canada to other parts.
It will also bring about a better understanding between our people and our neighbours
to the south, because a well-built, hard-surfaced road spreading itself from one end of
the country to the other, will attract many
more tourists than now come to this country.
The highway is also going to enable us to
become acquainted with parts of our country
that are not accessible at the present time.
There is a motor road along the north shore
of Lake Superior, but it is not of such a
character as to attract very many tourists. We
see glimpses of that rugged country from the
trans-continental train, but we cannot become
intimately acquainted with it unless there is
a highway which enables us to pass through
it, spend some time in it and enjoy its
beauties.
Each province of Canada has its own
attractions and we want Canadians and our
American neighbours to enjoy these attractions.
Honourable senators, I come now to
the bill itself. It is entitled an Act to
encourage and assist in the construction of
a Trans-Canada Highway. The purpose of
this bill is to make travel from coast to coast,
over an all-Canadian highway an everyday
occurrence. By that I mean that it is going
to be an all-weather highway, and it should
be open for motor traffic at all times of the
year.
The bill itself does not provide for the
construction of a trans-Canada highway, it
enables the federal government under certain
conditions to enter into agreements with the
various provincial governments, and these
agreements would provide for construction
of the highway. For some time now the
federal government has been consulting with
the governments of the provinces in order
to formulate an over-ail policy. Last December a conference was held with the provinces
to deal with preliminary matters. At that
time the project was under the then minister
of mines and resources, my colleague from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon), but since
then it has been transferred to the Minister
of Reconstruction and Supply, the Honourable

SENATE

Mr. Winters. In August and September of
this year the minister visited the provinces
and discussed details of the plans with the
provincial governments.
From those discussions and visits there have develooed
certain general principles which the federal
government has reason to believe will form
an important part of the ultimate agreements.
The general principles have been put forward to the provinces in correspondence, and
nearly all the provinces have replied, indicating that they agree with these principles.
I am advised that the concurrence, in a
general way, of those that did not reply has
been obtained orally. As I say the agreements are on general principles only, and do
not involve details.
Some of the suggested terms of agreement
that were forwarded to the provinces are
as follows:
(a) that the highway should be a modern, firstclass, hard-surfaced road, following the shortest
practical East-West route consistent with the needs
of the provinces and Canada as a whole;
(b) that the provincial government would be
responsible for the selection of a route in conformity with the above-mentioned definition;
(c) that except in national parks, the province
would arrange for the execution of the work;
(d) that the highway, when completed, would
remain in each province the property and responsibility of the province;
(e) that the federal government's contribution
would be in respect of a two-lane, modern highway;
(f) that the federal government's contribution
would be on the basis of 50 per cent of the cost to
the province of completing the highway;
(g) that an additional contribution would be
made, on a 50-50 basis of the costs of the province,
for those portions of already existing highway which
would be included in the trans-Canada highway;
(h) that the highway should be completed within
a period of seven years;
(i) that all ordinary maintenance costs during or
after the period of construction would be the
respcnsibility of the province;
(j) that tenders and specifications for contracts
would be subject to review by the federal government;
(k) that inspection of the highway and audit of
costs would be the privilege of the federal government.

Suggested standards, including a width of
pavement of 22 or 24 feet and a mininum
right-of-way of 100 feet, were also placed
before provincial governments. It is recngnized, however, that of necessity there will
be variations to meet local conditions, and
it is emphasized, therefore, that the various
technical specifications were put forward
only as suggestions.
I thought that a rather terse statement of
the general principles of the bill would make
the project more readily understood by
honourable members. I should now like to
make some further remarks.
It will be remembered that highways are
a matter of provincial jurisdiction. I recall

being a member of the House of Commons
in 1919, when a bill was put through parliament providing for a grant for highways.
The trans-Canada highway, as we are speaking of it today, was not in mind at that time,
the purpose then was to assist the provinces
in the extension of a highway system. It
was, however, recognized at once that the
provinces had control over highways.
At
every stage of the proceedings in connection
with this measure the government bas recognized the control which the provinces possess.
They have been building highways for many
years, and have specifications that apparently
suit their needs. No attempt will be made
to impose on them specifications which are
not suitable. There are certain points upon
which various provinces differ, and there are
technical details still to be worked out, but as
I have said, the provisions which I have read
have been well received.
The matter of route has been left to the
provinces.
Some have already indicated
their choice; the remainder are in the process
of trying to reach a determination. The highway as originally contemplated was to stretch
from Halifax to Vancouver. This has been
changed, and it is now proposed that it should
run from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton
Island, and should extend into the island
provinces of Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland.
It is estimated that the highway, of some
5,000 miles in length, will cost approximately
$300 million. This bill provides for payment
by the federal government of a share up to
$150 million. This calculation is made on
the basis of $60,000 for each mile of new
road that has to be built. In the case of this
new construction the position of the federal
government is relatively simple. Its share
will be one-half of the total cost. In the case
of roads already existing, it is proposed that
the federal government shall pay each province concerned one-half of the original cost
of those roads. This will have the effect of
making the federal government's share for
new construction considerably more than
fifty per cent. The provinces will be paid for
roads already existing, on which they will
not have to spend any money. They can
apply the money which they are not required
to spend on existing roads to their share of
the cost of new construction. It is expected
that in some cases this will mean the federal
government's contribution will finance as
much as 70 per cent of new construction.
The principles so far arrived at are the
result of discussions not only with the provinces, but with the Canadian Construction
Association, the Good Roads Association and

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
other interested organizations. Much information has been gathered from the appropriate
officials of the public roads administration in
the United States.
With this broad background it is the intention of the government to finalize agreements
with the provinces as soon as possible. Most
of the provinces have signified their desire to
start construction early in 1950, and it is the
government's intention to facilitate that desire
in every way.
In closing, may I be allowed to express
some personal opinions which, I am sure, are
not the opinions of the Minister responsible
for the Bill or of the government itself. I
envisage the time when there will be possibly two or three highways across Canada.
I say that because of experience in the United
States, where a number of highways have
been constructed with funds furnished by the
federal government at Washington, combined
with assistance from the states. My understanding is that in the United States contribution has been made on the same basis
as is provided for in this measure-50 per
cent by the federal government and 50
per cent by the states governments.
When speaking of more highways than the
one we are considering at the moment, I have
in mind parts of Canada where there are outstanding scenic attractions. I might mention
the area around the St. Lawrence River. A
highway on one side of the St. Lawrence
River may be all right in the early part of
what we may call the trans-Canada highway
policy, but the time will come when it will
be necessary to provide federal assistance for
a highway along the other side of the river.
The same condition may exist in the provinces bordering the Atlantic Ocean; certainly
it exists in Western Canada, where we have
the great Rocky Mountain ranges, with some
of the finest scenic attractions in the
dominion. I was about to say that we have
attractions superior to those of the Alps in
Switzerland. At least I may say that they
equal them. We know that Switzerland,
because of its great mountain attractions,
benefits largely in the receipt of money from
tourists. The same possibility exists for
Canada: tourist traffic can be expanded to a
remarkable extent if we have roads, accessible to tourists, which lead into these places.
I do not know whether the statement
which was made as to the intentions of the
Alberta Government with respect to the
location of the route is official or not, but
the impression has been left that the highway in that province which is to be part
of the trans-Canada highway will run to
Calgary, through Banff National Park and
into British Columbia by the Kicking Horse

Pass. But any resident of Alberta knows
there is a pronounced opinion that great
attractions for tourists are found in other
mountain sections, for instance from Edmonton west to Jasper Park and thence to the
Pacific coast. I recognize that this bill does
not provide any ground for a discussion of
the route, which is a matter for decision by
the provinces concerned, but if I were in
Alberta, and arguing as to which course the
highway should take, naturally I would contend that the road which could be built up
most quickly, and would probably have the
largest population contiguous to it, would be
the Crowsnest route. It may be that at some
later time federal assistance will be given
for the construction of other routes, particularly in such parts of the country as I
have referred to; and that this bill is but the
initial stage of a program of federal assistance to highways. I express only my own
opinion, but I believe that in time there will
be assistance from the federal treasury for
other routes, probably not extending wholly
across the country, but designed to meet
conditions which exist in the province of
Quebec, possibly in the Maritimes and
Ontario, and certainly in the areas bordering
the Rocky Mountains.
I close with the thought that this measure
is for the purpose of initiating a transcontinental highway on which the Canadian
people can travel from one end of the
dominion to the other, and which will enable
people from other countries to see more of
Canada than is possible now on an allweather highway. I believe this measure
will have valuable results in bringing our
people more closely together, making them
better acquainted with each other. Now and
for some years past people have preferred
to travel about the country by automobile
rather than by train, because they are
enabled to see the country in their own way,
to stop off where they wish and remain overnight or for a day or so. As I have said,
movements of this kind from one part of the
country to the other will give our people a
better knowledge of each other than they
have at the present time. I have pleasure,
therefore, in moving the second reading of
this bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: I shall not delay the
house long. All of us are glad that there is
at least the possibility of a trans-Canada
highway, but I am not an unqualified optimist
about it. I do not believe you will be able
to take a trip on it next summer, or, perhaps,
ten years from next summer.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: It must be built
within seven years.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have read the statute and
know what it says; but the time can be
extended.
Hon. Mr. Howard: It can't go through
Winnipeg!
Hon. Mr. Haig: It can't go any place else.
Ours is the only province in which there is
unanimity as to the course the road should
take. I understand that in the Maritime
Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia there are sections of public opinion which differ as to the
route the road should take through their
areas; but there is one province and one city
which cannot be by-passed, because if the
road through Manitoba were to run a little
further north it would run into the lake;
were it routed a little further south it would
pass over into the United States. It has to
go through Winnipeg.
That point being settledSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -I will go on to discuss
other matters. If I suggest some difficulties,
it is not for the purpose of throwing cold
water on the scheme. My experience in life
has taught me that if one faces difficulties at
the outset they are not so bad afterwards,
but if they are ignored or overlooked in the
beginning, they come bobbing up ail along
the way.
The first difficulty, of course, concerns the
lay-out of the route. Like the honourable
senator who has just spoken, I understand that
it has been agreed by the provinces of
Alberta and British Columbia that the road
through the mountains shall be via the
Kicking Horse Pass.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I do not say that that
is official. I say that it is my understanding.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And mine is exactly the
same. The Premier of Alberta has made an
announcement, and the road has got to go
where he says it is to go. Whether the route
through Alberta is north, by Jasper, or
through the Kicking Horse Pass, or down in
the territory of the honourable senator from
Lethbridge, the choice made will inevitably
determine the route through Saskatchewan.
With the greatest respect for the people of
Saskatchewan, I must point out that the
building of the highway in their province,
especially the construction west of Moose
Jaw, will pose serious problems, because the
greater proportion of the population will not
use the road west of Moose Jaw; they prefer
to go north to visit their great national parks.
The direction of tourist traffic from the United
States is and will be from the south to the
north, where there are good fishing grounds.

The honourable senator to my left (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) says that the finest fishing grounds
in the world are in northern Saskatchewan.
So the difficulty to be faced is that an important part of the trans-Canada highway in
Saskatchewan will not be much used, and
special assistance to the province will be
necessary if that section is to be completed.
In some years Saskatchewan, especially in the
southwest, has experienced great difficulties
because of adverse crop conditions. From the
point of view of utility to its citizens, probably
a better route would be north through Saskatoon and on to Edmonton.
Then let us look at conditions in Ontario.
I can appreciate the viewpoint of people in
the older areas. Is the road to run from
North Bay direct to this capital city, and
thus sidetrack Toronto-which I would not
be unwilling to doSome Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -or will it run through
Toronto and by the St. Lawrence river?
Another problem is connected with the construction of the road from Sault Ste. Marie to
Fort William. The scenery along the lake
shore is beautiful, but the cost of construction will be terrific, and the road will traverse
along territory in which there is practically
nothing to do but drive.
We in Manitoba have long favoured the
idea that first there should be agreement on
the entire route, and, once that primary difticulty is disposed of, that priority should be
given to the construction of certain parts of
the highway instead of a start being made
at one end and driving right through. For
instance, if the people of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are to use the highway,
the road from Winnipeg to Fort William is
particularly important. People from the
western part of Manitoba and Saskatchewan
can drive down to Fort William, put their
cars on the boats, cross to the other side of
the lake and drive down through Ontario.
Many people are making that trip now. There
is another route much favoured by American
tourists from the centre and middle states.
They come straight up from Minneapolis
and St. Paul to Winnipeg, travel east to Fort
William, journey along the lakefront to
Duluth and then return to Minneapolis and
St. Paul. These are some of the difficulties
we have to face.
I do not believe that this road can be built
for the figure named, because we are asking
the provinces to bear, in addition to the load
of 50 per cent, the cost of maintaining the
highway. As my honourable friend from
Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) well knows,
we have been building roads in Manitoba for

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
a good many years. Our subsoil is not good
for road building, and expensive foundations
have to be laid in order that the roads will
stand up. Heavy winter frosts and certain
other conditions make the upkeep of the roads
very expensive. Is it fair to ask the provinces
to maintain these roads? Take No. 1 highway, which runs from Winnipeg to Brandon,
a distance of approximately 145 miles. I
cannot tell you how much it costs to maintain that road, but I recall that when I was
in the legislature of Manitoba estimates
came up each year for repairs.
What about building these roads north
and south? My honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) says there is good
fishing in Northern Saskatchewan. Well,
there is good fishing in Northern Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Where?
Hon. Mr. Haig: North of Le Pas. I may
tell my honourable friend that Manitoba is
the only province that has dammed up its
northern lakes so as to maintain water levels
the year round for fowl, and if it were not
for the Dominion Government helping to
build dams in Saskatchewan, there would be
no ducks or anything else there. There are
great natural resources in the northern part
of Manitoba, but they are difficult to get at.
It was a common sight this summer to see
as many as ten and twelve tourist outfits
travelling north each day. They had boats on
the tops of their cars, and rigs for sleeping in.
They were going up north to fish.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: All the hunters go to
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not know there was
any hunting at al in Saskatchewan.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The wild life of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba is found in the
northern parts of these provinces. I can
imagine a man who lives south of the Alberta
boundary wanting to travel to the northern
part of Alberta. I can imagine that if I lived
in southern Saskatchewan I would want to go
up to the beautiful lake they have in northern
Saskatchewan. The same is true of Manitoba: everybody wants to go north. Every
summer a special train is put on the run to
Churchill, and I presume it is booked up now
for next summer.
I am in favour of the bill, but if the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) lives for another ten years, as I
hope he will, I am sure he will introduce a
new bill to grant another $150 million to
complete the building of this trans-Canada
highway. It will cost us about that much in
the long run, and we would be lucky to get
45785-23

by even at that figure. I suggest that the
Dominion Government, through the Minister
of Reconstruction, should get the provinces
together and have them agree on the over-all
picture.
If I may be pardoned for referring to my
native province of Manitoba, which I do not
usually do
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -I should like to say that
last year we undertook to build a superhighway from Winnipeg straight south. We
had an awful time, and there was a bitter
struggle in the legislature as to where the
highway should be built. Some thought it
should run east of the Red river and others
thought it should run west. In fact, this
difference of opinion had repercussions in
the recent election. The highway was built on
one side, and those who wanted it on the
other side were very discontented.
The over-all picture should be decided
upon before any work is commenced. Otherwise we shall run into difficulties. All
across Canada thorough tests should be made
of the soil where the highway is to be constructed. I know a young man in Winnipeg
who as chief highway engineer does this work
for the province of Manitoba. He also performed a similar duty for the Dominion
Government when they were building air
runways during the war. He told me about
the differences in soils which looked alike. I
know that the Red River Valley in Manitoba
has a peculiar soil formation. Down about
twenty feet from the surface there is a belt
of yellow clay which is much like a sponge.
When there is an abundance of rain the soil
swells up, but during a dry spell it contracts
and sinks. It is therefore not an uncommon
sight in Winnipeg and surrounding districts to see houses that have dropped threequarters of an inch in one year and have to
ba jacked up. The same condition affects
the highway which runs from Winnipeg to
Portage la Prairie. I urge that the provinces
be brought together to agree on the type of
highway that should be constructed and
where it should run. These matters should
be decided before we spend a nickel.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I think that is the
understanding.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be the understanding, but I want it to be a fact. For
instance, f ailure on the part of Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia to reach a decision would make a difference to Manitoba.
Suppose it were decided to build the highway
through Edmonton. The road would then run
northwest from Winnipeg. If the road were to
go through Calgary, it would run straight

SENATE
west from Winnipeg. This would make quite
a difference. The same situation would prevail
in Ontario. At the present time a road runs
-torth through Cochrane, practically following
ne route of the Canadian National Railway;
out the best road would be via Lake Superior,
because this would provide a closer connection for American traffic. Many Americans
come up from Wisconsin and Michigan, travel
as far as Fort William and then follow the
lake. These factors are very important.
Honourable senators, I am glad this bill
has come before us, and I am sure that every
Canadian welcomes the prospect of a transCanada highway. I entirely agree with the
honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) that such a highway would help to
unite Canada as nothing else would. People
from different parts of the country will be
able to visit each other more freely. I have
in mind a young man of about eighteen or
nineteen years of age, who was sent by the
son of one of our senators on a trip to the
coast. On his way west he stopped off at
Winnipeg and visited some close friends of
mine, and upon his return journey he paid
them another visit. This is the sort of thing
that means so much to the unity of Canada.
I do not care what you say to a young man
from Quebec about what a good place Winnipeg is to stop off at-and the same is true
about Vancouver-a personal visit will do
much more to convince him. I see that a certain senator from Vancouver knows what I
am referring to. These things may not mean
much to you or to me, but they will mean
very much in twenty years' time to those who
are our young people today. I heartily
support the bill.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I feel
that it is rather incumbent upon me to say a
few words about this measure. As you know,
for many years I have been associated in an
official and legislative capacity with the
administration and construction of railways,
highways and other public works. It is amazing to me that a suggestion that it is the
desire and the purpose of the federal government, in co-operation with the ten provinces,
to build five thousand miles of highway,
should be presented to us in the form of such
a short bill as this, and that we should accept
it. Why are we prepared to do this? It is
because the groundwork has been laid. We
have built two railways across Canada and
we know what they have done to support the
confederation of the provinces that constitute
this great dominion.
It bas been said that the bill is long overdue, and I am of that same opinion. In fact,
for years I have been urging that it was the
duty of the federal government to build or
to assist in the building of a national highway

across Canada, for to my mind such a road
will do more than anything else to cement our
national unity.
I wish to compliment the mover of the
second reading (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) upon his
clear statement of what is proposed by this
bill, and also to congratulate my honourable
friend the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) on his speech. He bas some doubts as
to the possibility of carrying through this
undertaking. But I am sure that if he will
read the minister's statement and recall what
has already been accomplished in Canada, he
will admit that today the people of this great
country are much more interested in co-operation and unity than in provincial rights.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: That co-operation and
unity was demonstrated in the tremendous
war effort made by our people during the
recent world conflict.
The statement made by the minister when
he introduced the bill in another place
showed with what care he consulted the various provincial governments, and I have no
doubt that agreements will be made with the
provinces, and that the highway will be constructed within even a shorter period than
he indicated.
From my own experience I know what
the building of highways in pioneer country means.
When I first entered the
Kootenay country, in 1898, we had only
Indian trails.
There was no connection
between East and West Kootenay; between
West Kootenay and the great Okanagan
Valley; or between the southern portion of
British Columbia and that vast hinterland
lying beyond the Peace River and the Finlay
River in Northern British Columbia. But
thanks to the industry and aggressiveness of
the people of British Columbia, we now have
highways that link together the various
valleys and settlements throughout that great
province.
The cost of building a modern highway
across the country is too great to be met out
of provincial revenues, and for that reason I
think the Government of Canada should be
commended for coming forward and offering
to co-operate with the various provinces in
the construction of this proposed transCanada highway. The highway will open up
vast areas of resources and scenic delights
beyond the conception of those who have not
travelled widely in Canada. It will enable
the people of Canada to become better
acquainted with their own country, with its
present and potential riches.
To one who has been associated with public works, as I have been, this is a most
I became Minister of
welcome measure.

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
Public Works in British Columbia in 1916,
during World War I. I have had the opportunity of serving as Minister of Public Works
in two governments, one federal and the
other provincial, both during and after a war
when apparently there was no money available for expenditure on public works. But as
the country grew and its population increased,
our various provinces managed to build quite
a few good highways, and today we have a
system of highways which under this bill can
be linked together to form a great transCanada route. I believe that it will not
require seven years to finish the transCanada highway, but that with proper
engineering technique and with co-operation
between the federal and provincial governments great portions of it will be available
for use within the next three or four years.
This great highway will serve not only our
own people but all who come to visit Canada,
and in that way it will be a tremendous boon
to our tourist traffic. There is in my mind
no doubt that the investments which the
federal and provincial governments will make
in this highway will yield a many-fold
return over the years, a return that possibly
will become evident during construction of
the road, and certainly shortly afterwards.
Honourable senators, it is not my purpose
to speak at length on the bill. Having had
something to do with pioneering, not only in
my native province of New Brunswick but
in the great province of British Columbia, I
am happy to see the introduction of this bill,
for the trans-Canada highway will make the
material riches and the scenic beauties of this
country more readily accessible to our own
people and to the people who visit us from
other lands.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I just wish to say a few words from the point
of view of one who lives in Saskatchewan.
Mention has been made here of the difficulties
of various provinces with respect to highway
construction, and it has been pointed out that
Saskatchewan will have very little if anything to say about the route to be taken by
the proposed trans-Canada highway. Saskatchewan, because its population is spread out
thinly over a huge area, has probably twice
as many miles of road per capita as any
other province. An all-weather road from
the south to the north is a "must" for my
province if it is to reap the greatest possible
advantage from tourist traffic. The same is
true also of other provinces. The honourable
senator who introduced the bill (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan), mentioned the great advantages
to be gained from the tourist trade by reason
of the proposed highway. I am not opposing
the bill on that ground, but I regret that it
45785-23à

is proposed to build a highway parallelling
railways over which people can now travel
and see much the same scenery as they would
see from a highway. If it were possible,
I should like to see the trans-Canada highway break new ground, and, for instance, go
up by Goldfields, which is now almost
inaccessible to the average traveller.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is well north of
the city of Winnipeg.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, north by way of
Flin Flon.
I wish to point out, honourable senators,
that because of the enormous burden Saskatchewan bears in maintaining many miles of
road, some special consideration should be
given to that province on the question of
costs.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I rise principally to ask a question of the
honourable senator who sponsored the
measure. But before doing so, I ask the
indulgence of the house while I say a few
words on the bill.
With the objects and principles of the bill
I think we are all agreed. It is with the
arrangements for the payment of the cost
that some of us take issue. I, like the previous
speaker, have always thought that when the
time came for the building of a national highway, the Dominion Government would assume
responsibility for a hundred per cent of its
cost. What concerns me is that there is going
to be a great deal of log-rolling in the provinces with respect to the route to be followed
-whether the highway will go through this
city or that-and that unless the Dominion
Government takes some stand in the matter
we may not have the truly national highway
which the members of this house envisage.
I have had the experience of driving across
the continent by motorcar some eight times.
One of my trips was made through Canada,
and after it was over, I said "Never again".
Anyone who has crossed the country on the
present Canadian roads realizes the great
need for a national highway. To those
senators who have spoken on behalf of
Saskatchewan, I say that I hope the federal
government will not approve of the building
of a national highway through the "Dust
Bowl". Any tourist who has run into a dust
storm in the province of Saskatchewan certainly would not choose to travel that route
again.
I am one of those who has never been
convinced that we have received the great
amount of money which is said to come to
Canada by way of tourist trade from across
the border.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have talked to many
Americans who come every year to the province of British Columbia, and I can assure
honourable senators that they bring everything they need with them. They travel in
modern motorcars and haul up-to-date trailers
with frigidaires in them. The only thing
they spend money on in Canada is gasoline.
I think those who are drumming up the
tourist business merely multiply some fictitious and imaginary sums and say that
because we have had so many tourists
therefore so much money has been spent here.
The great benefit of a national highway, as
was pointed out by the honourable senator
who sponsored the bill, lies in the tremendous
convenience it will be to Canadians in
travelling from one end of the country to the
other. It will mean that the people of the
eastern and central provinces will have an
opportunity to see the great natural beauties
of British Columbia and to realize that we in
that province are truly Canadian.
I think it would be a mistake to build this
proposed highway piecemeal. Anyone who
has travelled across the United States knows
that the modern highways in that country do
not pass through the cities. From what I
have heard of the discussion in the other
place, there is a lot of log-rolling taking place
with a view to having the highway go through
this city or that. I am concerned about the
possibility that, unless the Dominion Government gives some direction, the highway will
not be what we envisage.
My question to the honourable senator who
sponsors the bill concerns section 8, which
reads:
The Minister of Mines and Resources may out
of moneys appropriated by Parliament provide for
the construction of such highways within the
National Parks as form part of a trans-Canada
highway.

My question is this: Will the Minister of
Mines and Resources, when this highway is
built, allow trucks to travel through the
national parks? At the present time they
are prohibited from doing so. In Vancouver
and New Westminster we have trucking outfits which want to carry produce to Calgary
and Edmonton but when they ask for permission to travel on roads through the
national parks, the Minister of Mines and
Resources refuses to grant it. It is only by
special leave that a truck is allowed to go
into the parks. I am wondering whether the
Minister of Mines and Resources will allow
a right-of-way through the national parks to
commercial trucks en route from the Pacifie
Coast to certain points in Alberta. May I
have an answer to that question?

Hon. Mr. Copp: How can the honourable
senator answer that question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: He could find the answer.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
it is my intention to move, if and when the
house gives the bill second reading, that it
be referred to committee. The honourable
member from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
may have some particular knowledge which
I do not possess, but my common sense tells
me that the ordinary provisions affecting the
operation of trucks in national parks would
cover the proposed national highway, unless
special circumstances exist.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I may say to the
honourable senator from New Westminster,
(Hon. Mr. Reid) that I have read the discussion which took place in the other house, and
the question now asked was put to the minister. He replied that the department realized the existence of this problem, and that
it was proposed to discuss it in the conference between the federal and provincial governments, with a view to overcoming it.
If I might offer a suggestion of my own,
which as a supporter of the government I
have no right to do, I would say that the
only route which would not be subject to
that obstacle would be the southern route
through the Crow's Nest Pass.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 142, an Act to amend the
National Housing Act, 1944.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second

I may say that there is some uncertainty
about whether we will be able to proceed
tomorrow with all the matters before us. For
the convenience of all concerned I have asked
that certain measures be put down for consideration then, but if for some reason I am
not prepared to go ahead at that tirne, they
may have to stand until the following day.

DIVORCE STATISTICS, 1949
FINAL REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine (Chairman of the Standing Committee on Divorce): Honourable senators, I know that you have been waiting for
the final report of the Standing Committee
on Divorce. I propose at this time to read it.
The Standing Committee on Divorce beg leave
to make their 180th report, as follows:
For the -present session 244 petitions for bills of
divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt
with by the Committee on Divorce, as follows:
166
Petitions heard and recommended ........
1
Petitions heard and rejected ..............
8
Petitions withdrawn .......................
Petitions not proceeded with at the present
69
session ...................................
244
Total ....................................
Of the petitions recommended during the present
session 43 were by husbands and 123 were by wives.
Ahl petitioners are domiciled in the province of
Quebec.
The committee held 29 meetings. On seven days
the committee functioned in two sections.
In 36 cases the committee recommended that part

of the parliamentary fees be remitted.
The fees paid in Parliament for bills of divorce
(heard and recommended) during the year 1949
amounted to $64,800.
Assuming that ail bills of divorce recomniended
by the committee and now In various stages before

Parliament receive Royal Assent, the comparison
of dissolutions of marriage granted by Parliament
in the last ten years is as follows:

I think honourable senators would be
interested in a few other statistics, covering
the number of divorces granted in the whole
of Canada during that part of the last three
years of which there is a record. The 1949
record is not yet complete.

figures.

In 1946 about 50 per cent of the applicants
were husbands and 50 per cent were wives:
these proportions may be explained by the
fact that during the war many husbands
were overseas and their wives were left in
Canada. In 1949, as far as I can find out,
about 25 per cent of petitions for divorce
were presented by husbands, and 75 per
cent by wives.
I do not propose to go into the general
question of divorce.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Before we pass from
this matter, I should like once again to express
my appreciation of the work of the Chairman

SENATE
of the Divorce Committee and those associated
with him. It is an arduous task, and they
have discharged their duties in a manner
that is a credit to themselves and to the
Senate. It remains to be seen whether some
other method will be adopted in the future;
but while the trial of divorces remains a function of this house, it is our responsibility to
see that it is properly discharged.
As government leader in the Senate, I
want to again express my appreciation of
the splendid and untiring services of the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), and those associated with him.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
NATIONAL

DEFENCE BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE-CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED

Hon. Salter A. Hayden presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill J-5, an Act respecting
National Defence.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of November 8, 1949, examined the
said bill, and now beg leave to report the
same with several amendments.
As I understand it is not the intention to
deal with this report before tomorrow, I do
not think it is necessary for me to read the
various amendments.
Some Hon. Senalors: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall these
amendments be taken into consideration?

Commonwealth of Nations, so that our par-

ticular system will be Canada-owned. The
present action is really the culmination of a

long growth in telegraphic

communication,

and is the outcome of the wonderful inventions which have practically abolished the
time element in the transmission of electrical
messages.
In this connection it is interesting to recall
the laying of the first cable across the Atlantic
ocean. It was in 1858 that the method of
electrical communication was applied successfully, or with partial success, to overocean or under-ocean communication. The
first cable was laid by two ships which sailed
into the middle of the Atlantic ocean, where
they spliced the two halves of the cable
and sailed in opposite directions, reaching
shore without a cable break. While the cable
was successfully laid, unfortunately the cable
itself was only a momentary success. The
records show that it took sixty-seven minutes
to transmit a ninety-word message from
Queen Victoria to the President of the United
States, and that shortly afterwards the signals

failed altogether. It was not until 1865 that
the magnificent

ship,

the

Great Eastern,

finally succeeded in laying a permanently
successful cable from Great Britain to Newfoundland. This cable was later connected
with the mainland, and I understand it is still
doing business. The Great Eastern has been
described as the most discussed ship that
ever was built and also the most signal
failure in the history of shipbuilding. She
was a vessel of 18,915 tons with eight

engines, and costing £750,000.

She was for

CANADIAN
OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATION CORPORATION BILL

those days, a tremendous ship, and when I
heard about her in my youth I was amazed;
but compared with present-day ocean-going
ships of 35,000 tons, she is nothing much to
speak about. So large was the Great Eastern
that in those days they could not get enough

SECOND READING

cargo to make her a commercial success, and

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting.

The purpose of the bill is to nationalize the
telecommunication system of Canada, in

so she was used to carry troops, and later was
fitted for the laying of cables. Chartered by
a company organized by Cyrus W. Field,
whose name is still a household word among
those of our generation, the ship successfully laid this 4,000 ton cable over a distance of 2,370 miles at a total cost of
$1,256,000.
These figures are interesting because they
compare most strikingly with those of
modern times and modern successes. Before
concluding my reminiscing I would point out
that the Great Eastern was finally sold for
£16,000, taken to a shipyard and was broken
up. Since that time the whole world has
been interlaced with cables which carry com-

association with other members of the British

mercial and other messages instantaneously.

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 12, an Act to estab-

lish the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have asked the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to handle this bill.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable sena-

tors, this is a somewhat important bill,
involving a large amount of detail. It came
into my hands only yesterday afternoon, and
I may have to ask your indulgence if I cannot answer all the questions that may be put
to me at this time.

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
Another interesting point is that the cost
of sending a message, not exceeding twenty
words, over this first cable laid by the Great
Eastern was £20; or £1 per word. A pound
was a pound in those times. Nowadays a
cable can be sent to England for ninepence,
or eighteen cents a word, and there is no
limitation on the number of words.
The first wireless signal to go across the
ocean was sent from Cornwall to Newfoundland in 1901. That was just a general broadcast, and the first beamed message was sent
in 1908. The relative inexpensiveness of
wireless signals soon threatened to put the
cable companies out of business and resulted
in the making of certain arrangements for the
control of the wireless and cable systenis.
The name of the company owning the cables
between Great Britain and Canada and other
parts of the then Empire was formerly the
Imperial and International Communications
Company and is now Cable and Wireless
Limited. That is the company with which
we are dealing in this bill. The purpose of
the bill is to constitute a company called
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, which will take over that portion
of the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited
located in Canada, and make them Canadian
owned. Other countries of the Commonwealth are taking similar action. The undersea cables will remain the property of the
United Kingdom and under the control of
the post office department of that country.
The competition of wireless messages with
cable messages made it difficult for the cable
companies to survive, and at a great conference, which I think was held in London, the
interests of all the telecommunication companies were merged. That was in 1928. It
was felt, quite properly, that although wireless communication possessed certain advantages over cable communication, it was
necessary to maintain the cables because
they made it possible to render some services
which could not be rendered by the new
wireless method. So the cable and radio
interests were merged, with a capitalization
of £30 million. Earnings of the merger were
limited to approximately 6 per cent, or
£1,865,000. No ownership was affected at
that time, but control of all the companies
then engaged either in undersea or wireless
communication was vested in the Commonwealth Communications Advisory Committee,
which was given power over the general
policy, services and rates of all these companies. This very materially affected the
Canadian Marconi Company as well as the
cable shore establishments in Canada.
According to the arrangement made in
1928, any earnings in excess of £1,865,000
were to be divided in this way: 50 per cent

to be distributed among the companies and
50 per cent to be applied to the reduction of
rates.
But unfortunately the optimism that
attended the making of that arrangement
was short lived. The world-wide expansion
of wireless communication in the '20s drastically reduced the cable companies' profits,
and in the '30s came the depression. So in
1937 there was another conference, at which
it was agreed that the companies would not
retain earnings in excess of 4 per cent on
their capitalization. But these companies,
which had not earned 6 per cent in any year
since 1929, were after 1937 unable to earn
even 4 per cent.
In 1937 all the companies applied to the
Commonwealth Communications Advisory
Committee for permission to increase their
rates. The application was refused and
instead a reduction in rates was ordered, the
idea perhaps having been that this would
bring about an increase in volume of business
and in net profits. The maximum rate of 58
cents from Canada to South Africa and of 51
cents from Canada to India was reduced to
30 cents. But once again there was overoptimism. War broke out before there had
been a single year's operations to test the
effect of the reduced rates on the net profits.
Of course, during the war years the companies made big money and paid large sums
in excess profits taxes.
An agreement entered into at the 1937
conference contained a clause that all parties
should resist the opening of new circuits, but
war conditions made it impossible to enforce
this clause. New circuits were opened, particularly between the United States and
various parts of the Commonwealth-Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India and
Southern Rhodesia-and these diverted much
traffic from the Commonwealth system.
Another conference was held at London
in 1945, when all the countries of the commonwealth entered into an agreement committing themselves to take over the wireless
transmission systems and the undersea cable
systems operating between the countries. The
Commonwealth Telegraphs Agreement, as it
was called, was signed on May 11, 1948, and
that is the agreement which this bill proposes to implement. The agreement, which
is too lengthy to discuss in detail, contained
three important provisions. First, each partner government is committed to acquire the
external telecommunication assets operating
within its territory, with the exception of
cableheads. I may say that cableheads are
merely the huts at the shore end of a cable,
and are unimportant. That provision ineans
that we would take over the system in Canada

SENATE
up to the cableheads, and the cable would
remain vested in the United Kingdom, under
the control of the Post Office of that country.
The agreement further provided that the
parties bind themselves to nominate an existing department of the government, or to
establish a public corporation to be known
as the "national body" for the purpose of
acquiring, operating and maintaining such
assets.
The agreement further provided that the
partner governments should appoint a representative to a commonwealth telecommunication board, to be established. This board has
now been established, and the government
has announced that the Canadian representative will be T. H. Tudhope, General Manager
of Operations for the Trans-Canada Air Lines.
The United
Kingdom, Australia,
New
Zealand, India, South Africa and Southern
Rhodesia have already established their
national bodies in much the same manner as
Canada proposes to do by this bill. The
United Kingdom national body will own,
operate and maintain all assets not situated
in the territories of any of the partner governments and also the cableheads within those
territories.
I now come to the bill itself, which I note
is divided into seven parts. The first part
deals with interpretations. The second part,
which is headed "corporation established",
should, I think, be called "constitution of
the corporation". It has to do with the Canadian national body, to which I have referred.
The third part comes under the heading of
"powers and purposes" of the new corporation. The remaining parts of the bill deal
with staff, acquisition of property and financing and there are some general provisions.
There is to be a board of five persons in
the Canadian national body, one only of
whom is to be paid. He shall act as President
and General Manager of the Canadian organization. Appointments are to be made by
order in council. It is intended that the
directors shall be appointed regionally, one
perhaps coming from Montreal, another from
Toronto-we will skip Winnipeg-and the
Maritimes and British Columbia will have
representation. The head office of the corporation will be in Ottawa.
It is interesting to note that the board,
when constituted, will have some influence
over policy and management; but it must
comply with the directions of the Governor
in Council or the Minister, and its by-laws
must be approved by order in council. In
that way the government of Canada will
have complete control over the operations
of this board.

The staff of the corporation will not come
under the control of the Civil Service Commission. There are reasons for this. None
of the other Crown companies are manned
by civil servants, and with the exception of
a few individuals who leave the service of
Canada to serve for a time in a Crown company, none of them come under the provisions
of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. I
am not entirely in agreement with this
arrangement, but I observe with some satisfaction that the bill makes provision for the
setting up of a system of superannuation for
the employees of the Canadian national body.
The question of financing is of course of
interest to honourable senators. It has been
estimated by Mr. Connelly, the Manager of
the Canadian end of the system, that the
corporation will require $4,500,000 for the
purchase of the assets to be taken over and
for working capital. The profits of the
corporation, if any-and I hope there will
be some-will go to the government; but
what perhaps is more important is the provision that the government will be responsible
for deficits. I observe that the Canadian
Marconi Company has lost money in recent
years. It may be that under the new general
management the results will be different.
In addition to the $4,500,000 to be voted by
this bill, the corporation may borrow up to
$100,000 from the government.
The bill contains certain general provisions of which I think honourable senators
will approve. The corporation is authorized
to pay municipal taxes in the amount that
would have been paid had the property
acquired by the corporation not become
vested in the Crown. The amount of the
taxes will be arrived at by agreement, rather
than by assessment of the property.
Provision is made for an accounting system
and for an annual report.
The price which Canada will pay to Cable
and Wireless Limited and to the Canadian
Marconi Company has not yet been fixed.
It is hoped that this can be done by agreement. The fact that the operations of the
Canadian Marconi Company have not been
profitable in the past will no doubt not be
overlooked by those who negotiate the agreement on Canada's behalf.
Should it be
impossible to reach an agreement between
the parties, the bill makes provision for
reference to the Exchequer Court of Canada
to fix the amount payable by the public to
the companies.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The proceeding, in that
event, would be by way of expropriation.

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Expropriation Act
is in part incorporated in this bill. The
major portion of the powers to be conferred
on the corporation are contained in the bill
and, generally speaking, they are very wide.
The corporation may take over any property
it wishes, and later settle by agreement or
by reference to the Exchequer Court of
Canada.
With regard to operations, the Canadian
company, in accordance with the general
arrangement with all the Commonwealth
nations, will retain the receipts from business originating in Canada, subject of course
to the payment of carrying charges to carrier
companies not within the Commonwealth
system. We shall pay nothing for the transmission of a message from, say, Canada to
England, but Britain will collect the local
rates which are paid on messages from the
United Kingdom to Canada; similarly, Canada
collects the local rates on messages from
this country to Britain. There is, of course,
a general system which will be used by all
the partner governments. The over-all costs
of that system are paid in the proportion
which the net receipts of Canada bear to the
net receipts of the entire system. That is,
we shall pay that proportion of the general
overhead expenses of the entire system.
I have given a short but, I think, a rather
comprehensive explanation of the bill. As
I have said, it is a very important measure.
I suggest that it be referred to a committee,
and this I do for several reasons. One is
that I think the phraseology of the bill itself
requires some intensive study. Secondly,
honourable senators will have an opportunity
to hear the men who have been managing our
systems from a governmental standpoint for
many years, and who know most about this
matter.
If I did not suppose that the house would
refer this bill to a committee, I would have
something to say about the property which
is to be taken over, and the various costs
referable to it. But this can be done more
appropriately in committee than in this
house, and by somebody who knows much
more about it than I do. So, unless anybody
has a question in that regard, I shall say
nothing more about it. I trust, however, in
view of the importance of the measure, the
fact that it has been passed by practically all
the nations of the Commonwealth, and that
Canada by an agreement of our government
and the general body and the various other
members of the Commonwealth is already
committed to it, there will be no hesitation
on the part of this house to give it second
reading-which I now move.
45785-24

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I did not hear all of
the honourable senator's explanation. Was
there anything in it with regard to the control of rates? Is there any body to control
rates?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, there is. Perhaps
in my explanation I failed in that regard. To
begin with, there is the general body, which
I have described, the directors of the Canadian National body, as it is called; that is,
the corporation. Then there is a board which
succeeds the old advisory board, and which
will control the rates; because rates are more
than merely local, they are an element of the
general system. To that board each of the
partner governments is to nominate one
representative. Canada, therefore, will nominate one. The United Kingdom, in addition
to its own representative, has the right to
nominate another person to represent the
colonies that are affected, and which are distinguished from the dominions. Each dominion, such as South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand and India, nominates its own member; but Ceylon and several other countries,
whose names I cannot reel off quickly, will
be represented by this one director who will
be nominated by the United Kingdom. We
have, through our representative, the same
or almost the same powers with respect to
the control of rates as any of the other commonwealth governments possess. The board
will be supreme in the matter of rates.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When this bill becomes law,
will the effect as far as Canada is concerned
be the same as in Great Britain, where telecommunications have already been nationalized? In this bill we use a more polite word,
but will not the effect in this country be
exactly the same as in Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Substantially, yes; in
detail, no. Great Britain has nationalized the
local system, but it also possesses the underwater cables. Of course there is no ownership of the air over the sea. There is another
distinction: our system, although the property
is vested in His Majesty, will be owned and
controlled by a Crown company, and managed by a board of directors, although that
board must obey the orders of the minister
and of the Governor in Council. In the United
Kingdom control is vested in the Post Office.
Other than these distinctions, which I do not
think are substantial, we in Canada will be
in exactly the same position as they are in
the United Kingdom, or as they will be in
South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and
various other parts of the commonwealth.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Will the capitalization,
which I understood was something over

SENATE
$4 million, represent the approximate cost of
the properties which the corporation will
embrace in its system?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I sincerely hope not. I
do not expect that we shall be paying four
and a half million dollars for these properties,
and my hope is shared, I believe, by the
officers who will carry out the transaction.
The estimate itself provides for two and a
half million dollars to the Marconi Company
for all its works and lands and so on, and a
much smaller amount to the Cable Company.
Half a million dollars of the four and a half
millions is for working capital. It may be
that we shall be disappointed in our negotiations, or in the price fixed by the Exchequer
Court if the matter is referred to that court.
We may pay more than four million dollars,
but I shall be disappointed if that is the outcome. I do not believe the assets are worth
any more than four millions, and it is the
consensus of opinion in the department that
they are worth a great deal less.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Am I correct in thinking that the Marconi Wireless and Cable
System is separate from the manufacturing
activities of the corporation which are carried on in Montreal, and which, as everybody
knows, include the making of radios and
other electrical goods? They are separate
companies, are they not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, entirely so. All we
are taking over from the Marconi Company
is their telecommunication system outside of
the Dominion of Canada. There is a possibility that we shall also take over their wireless system from St. John to Montreal, but
that has not yet been determined. Money is
being appropriated to make this possible if
the purchase can be made at an attractive
price; but the Marconi Company is not going
out of business.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
PACIFIC GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY AID
BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second Reading of Bill 146, an Act to
authorize the granting of a subsidy to the
government of the province of British Columbia in aid of the construction of an extension
to the Pacific Great Eastern Railway.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have asked the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) to handle this bill.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
as a Canadian from British Columbia it gives
me a great deal of pleasure to deal with this
proposed legislation, which authorizes the
granting of a subsidy to the government of
British Columbia in aid of the construction of
an extension to the Pacific Great Eastern
Railway. This legislation was passed in the
other place, and while many speeches were
made, there was no opposition whatsoever to
the granting of the money. It was pointed
out by the Minister that in 1913 a precedent
was established when the Canadian government made a grant of $6,400 a mile to the
Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway,
which is now known as the Ontario Northland
Railway.
The history of the Pacific Great Eastern
Railway is misunderstood to a large extent,
and right here may I make one comment.
This railway runs through what is known as
the Cariboo country. Its present terminus is
Quesnel, situated only a few miles from
Barkerville, the mecca of the famous Cariboo
gold rush of 1858. If honourable senators will
let their minds go back just a few years, they
will recall that the Cariboo gold rush commenced when the mainland of British Columbia was nothing but a Hudson Bay reserve,
roamed by caribou and inhabited by a few
white traders. The immediate effect of the
Cariboo gold rush was to cause the mainland
of British Columbia to become a Crown
colony. The rapid influx of so many people
resulted in the commencement of final negotiations to bring about the construction of the
Canadian Pacific Railway from the Atlantir
to the Pacific. That is why I say it is fitting
today, especially for one who for years repre.
sented the Cariboo country in another place,
that the federal government should be granting financial assistance for the extension of
the railway from Quesnel to Prince George.
Many of those who joined in the Cariboo
gold rush came from the south at the conclusion of the California gold rush, but many
others came across Canada. Those who came
across Canada either went down the Thompson river to Kamloops, then across and back
up to Barkerville, or went right across to Fort
George, or what is now known as Prince
George. From there they went to Quesnel and
back eastward to the Barkerville country.
That country which did so much to bring
about the construction of the trans-continental
Canadian Pacific Railway at that time, is
today receiving assistance from the federal
government for a long-needed construction.

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
As I have said, the history of the Pacifie
Great Eastern Railway is greatly misunderstood. The building of that railway has been
called a waste of money, but it has done an
immense amount of good for this country.
Close to Barkerville, which was the centre of
the Cariboo gold rush, is located the town of
Wells, where for many years two great goldproducing mines have been in operation, and
not too far away are the great gold-producing
mines of the Bridge River District. The Pacifie
Great Eastern Railway has therefore been a
tremendous help to the production of gold in
that area.
A large portion of the district of Cariboo
is cattle country, and without the railway it
would have been extremely difficult to have
continued there the production of cattle. For
many years the cattle producers and ranchers
of the Cariboo country have actually been
losing money, because the Pacifie Great Eastern Railway which carried their cattle to
market had to discharge them at Squamish
before reaching the market at Vancouver.
I think my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) will agree with me
when I say that cattle lose in value when
they have to make a long voyage by boat
instead of being transported by train.
There were three reasons for the commencement of the construction of the Pacifie Great
Eastern Railway. The first was that it would
provide an independent or direct route for the
Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway to the city
of Vancouver. And just here may I say a
word about this first basic reason for
the proposed construction of this railway in
1912? Messrs. Foley, Welch and Stewart, the
company which brought about the commencement of construction of the railway, had
entered into an agreement with the Grand
Trunk Pacific Railway, under which the
latter undertook that all the freight and
express it was carrying, destined for Vancouver, would be discharged at Fort George
and would be given transmission over the
proposed Pacifie Great Eastern Railway from
Fort George to Vancouver.
The second reason was, naturally, to open
up the central portion of British Columbia.
And, as I have pointed out, the Pacifie Great
Eastern Railway has helped marvellously in
doing that.
The third reason was to provide an outlet
for the Peace River country through Vancouver.
I wish now to place on the record a brief
statement of the two routes established by
legislation for the Pacifie Great Eastern
Railway. The original one, set out in 1912,
was:

north along the margin of Howe Sound; thence
following the general course of the Squamish River
and continuing northeasterly to Lillooet, on the
Fraser River; thence along the bank of the Fraser
River north to a junction with the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway at or near Fort George, a distance
of 450 miles more or less.

Then in 1914 the legislature of British
Columbia, which offered certain assistance to
the project, provided this route:
From a point of junction with the Grand Trunk
Pacific Railway at or near Fort George to a point on
the eastern boundary of this province within or
near the Dominion Peace River Block, a distance of
330 miles, more or less.

That opens up several questions which, on
account of the late hour, I shall deal with
briefly. First I would point out that the
distance from Quesnel to Prince George is
82.7 miles, and as the subsidy provided for
by this bill is not more than $15,000 per mile
the total cannot exceed $1,240,500.
Hon. Mr. Leger: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? What proportion of the
cost will $15,000 per mile pay?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The cost estimated, by
the government of British Columbia is
$97,000 -a mile, so $15,000 would be a little
less than one-sixth.
Hon. Mr. Leger: It must cost a great deal
to build railways out there.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: There is no doubt that
the cost is heavy. Of course, railway construction costs, like all other costs, have gone
up greatly in recent years. The aid given
to the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario
Railroad in 1913 was, if I remember rightly,
$6,400 a mile, which is a little less than onehalf the aid proposed here. There has been
a very great increase in construction costs
since 1913.
I was talking about the three basic reasons
for the construction of the railway. One of
course disappeared because the railway was
not built within the agreed time to Fort
George.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will my honourable friend
give us an idea of the cost per year of the
Pacific Great Eastern line?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I cannot give the exact
figure, but unquestionably it has been very
very heavy. The legislature of British
Columbia has from time to time voted to the
Pacifie Great Eastern Railway loans that total
approximately $23 million. Two statements
have been made in another place as to the
total cost of the railroad, but neither is
official. One put the figure at $100 million
and the other at $115 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The total cost to date?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: To date. But when we

the city of North Vancouver, and thence running are trying to determine whether that cost is

SENATE

too high or not we must not forget that one
reason why it is so high is that the railroad
has never been built to its projected terminus.
If the construction had been continued from
Vancouver to Fort George to a point of
junction with the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway, and if it had been possible to take
advantage of the agreement entered into by
the founders of the Pacifie Great Eastern Railway, Messrs. Foley, Welch and Stewart, with
the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway, there
would have been an entirely different picture,
because the railway income would have been
proportionate to the cost of construction. But
during the years since the railway has been
operating its revenue, being purely local, has
not been proportionate to the cost of construction. The road would never have been
constructed if it had been known that it could
receive only local revenues.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have one more question,
which is not by way of criticism at all. The
voting of this money will enable the road to
be operated from Fort George to where?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: To Squamish.

Hon. Mr. Haig: How many miles is it from
Squamish to Vancouver?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That would be about 70
miles.
Hon. Mr. Horner: About 40 miles.
Hon. Mr. King: It is about 70 miles.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I have made the trip by
boat.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: But the distance by boat

is not the same as the distance overland.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Why do you anticipate that
the railway will be any better off aflter the
extension, if it still does not run to
Vancouver?

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: There are several
reasons. The railway will have an advantage
that it never had before, a connection with
the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which
runs across the continent and through Edmonton and Fort George to Prince Rupert. By
way of answer to the honourable gentleman's
questions, I wish to refer to a statement
which appeared in the press on the 5th of
November. A newspaper clipping which I
have here is headed: "Northern Empire Foreseen. Population of Eleven Million." The
item is based upon an official report by some
department of government at Washington. I
am referring to this report simply because
it has a bearing on the question of the
increased revenue that will accrue to the
Pacific Great Eastern after it reaches Fort

George. This report is not from Ottawa, but
from Washington. A newspaper article on it
reads in part as follows:
The report, which is in the hands of the President, comes out strongly for the elimination of
American restrictions which, at present, prevent
Canadian vessels from carrying cargoes from Canadian to Alaskan ports.
"The inside passage through Canadian waters (to
Alaska) is a symbol of the physical interdependence
of the two great American nations in the Pacific
northwest," the report says.

That points out. one of the many benefits

to be gained as a result of the railway going
into Prince George. Also, Prince Rupert will
become a greater port, because it can then
handle cargoes going to the United States,
an activity which is now prohibited. The
linking up of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway with the Canadian National Railways,
which now carries everything to and from
Prince Rupert, will add greatly to the
revenue of the Pacifie Great Eastern.
The construction of eighty-two miles of
railway from Quesnel to Prince George will
not give railway service to Vancouver, which
is very important; but the provincial government has undertaken to spend a large sum
of money in building what I hope will be an
extra good highway from Squamish to Vancouver. I have discussed this project with
some of the cattle producers of the Cariboo
country, and while they would much prefer
a railway, they tell me that if they can ship
their cattle over a properly surfaced highway
they will not lose the money they have lost
in the past in getting their cattle to the
Vancouver market.
The passing of this legislation and the
federal grant of slightly under a million and
a quarter dollars for help in the construction
of a railway from Quesnel to Prince George
will be of great benefit to the majority of the
people of British Columbia.
Honourable senators will note that the
second route set out in 1914 for the Pacifie
Great Eastern Railway started at a point at
or near Fort George-now Prince Georgeand proceeded to a town named Pouce Coupe,
which is a short distance from the AlbertaBritish Columbia boundary in the Peace
River country. I was a member of the
Alberta legislature when, in 1913, it was
decided to assist in the construction of what
is now known as the Northern Alberta Railways. At that time the railway was known
as the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British
Columbia Railway. Today only twenty-four
miles of the Northern Alberta Railways
extend into British Columbia from the provincial boundary, to the town of Dawson
Creek, south of the Peace River. Another
branch of these railways runs north of the

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
Peace River and has its terminus at Hines
Creek in the province of Alberta. All the
people of Alberta are anxious that this branch
be extended from Hines Creek into British
Columbia, through St. John, and as far at
least as Hudson Hope. They are most anxious
to see that great Peace River country connected with the Pacifie Ocean, by a short rail
route towards Vancouver and Prince Rupert.
May I go back again and recall to the
minds of honourable senators a thought
which is significant today when we are discussing a vote of money by the dominion
government to aid the government of British
Columbia in the construction of this railway.
I pointed out a few minutes ago the tremendous effect that the Cariboo gold rush
had upon the speeding up of construction of
the Canadian Pacific Railway through the
mountains. Honourable senators know, particularly those who are from British Columbia, what is meant by the railway belt. It
will be recalled that at the time of the building of the Canadian Pacifie Railway British
Columbia was a province-not a territory
such as the Northwest Territories-and that
it gave to the Dominion of Canada a lien
upon a vast acreage of land which paralleled
the proposed right-of-way of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. This area was called the
railway belt. It was turned over to the
Dominion government to be used for land
grant purposes, as required, for the purpose
of aiding the construction of the railway.
The land was given free of charge for that
purpose.
When we talk today of the Peace River
block of British Columbia, I wonder how
many people throughout Canada understand
to what we refer. The term "block" refers
to only a portion of the Peace River district
which is in British Columbia, and it does
not relate to the Peace River area in Alberta.
The Peace River block came into being when
British Columbia found that a large part of
the land within the railway belt was not
being used for grants, and as the area was
then served by rail transportation the land
was required for other purposes. An agreement was entered into between the province
and the Dominion Government, under which
a great part of the free land within the railway belt was returned to British Columbia,
and this huge Peace River block was given
over to the administration of the Dominion
Government for its use, in lieu of the lands
which were returned to British Columbia
from the railway belt.
It was not until 1928-which was a long
time after the building of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway-that, as a result of the report of a
Royal Commission headed by the Honourable

Mr. Justice W. M. Martin of Saskatchewan,
the Peace River block was given back to
British Columbia, and its administration
removed from the control of the Dominion
Government. At the end of the First World
War the federal government did an excellent
job of inducing many war veterans to go to
the Peace River country in British Columbia
and take up land. There is no question that
one of the inducements honestly held out to
them to go to that country was that before
too long a railway would be provided to the
Pacifie Coast. My honourable friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) kindly shakes
his head affirmatively. He knows whereof I
speak.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: How large is that block
of land?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It extends from the
boundary of Alberta westward to a point half
way between Fort St. John and Finlay Forks,
a distance of approximately sixty miles, and
thence about the same distance north and
south. I am not giving exact figures, but
roughly they are correct.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: 360 square miles.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It includes some of the
most productive land in Canada. Sir Henry
Thornton, President of the Canadian National
Railways, being desirous of bringing a greater
settlement into that Peace River country of
British Columbia which was under dominion
administration-stated that when 10,000,000
bushels of wheat were produced in that Peace
River block railway connection with Vancouver would be provided. Today over
20,000,000 bushels of wheat are produced
annually in that area, but we are still without
a railway connection with either Vancouver
or Prince Rupert.
There has been a great demand for these
railway facilities, and I should like to cite,
without taking time to place it fully on the
record, a recommendation made in 1944 by
the Parliamentary Committee on Reconstruction, of which I was chairman. That committee, consisting of thirty-five members,
recommended that the provinces of Alberta
and British Columbia should have railway
connection through the Peace River country,
and that the road be extended as far as the
Pacifie Ocean. About the same time the
British Columbia Government set up a committee on reconstruction. The chairman, the
Honourable H. G. Perry, was one of the
greatest pioneers of that great north-central
country which surrounds Prince George. Mr.
Perry then and for many years was the
provincial member for that district, which
included Prince George, a large area south

SENATE
of the city, and all the Peace River country.
Later he was Speaker of the Assembly, then
Minister of Education, and now he is a newspaper publisher. The provincial committee of
which he was chairman made two recommendations: That there be a railroad in
British Columbia from the Peace River to
Vancouver, and that the Dominion Government negotiate with the Government of the
United States concerning the construction of
a railway through Prince George down the
Rocky Mountain trench, across the Yukon,
and into Alaska. There has been some
fruition of that latter recommendation,
because, as we know, negotiations may take
place between the two governments at any
time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just one question before
you finish. The bill provides for a grant of
one and a half million dollars, but the cost
to some other party is six and a half million
dollars. Is that party the Province of British
Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Only British Columbia
pays the balance-nobody else. British Columbia bas definitely decided to proceed with
the construction of this railway to Prince
George. Subject, of course, to some choice of
routes, it has also been practically determined
to build the railway into the Peace River
country. It is fitting that at this time, a month
or so before another federal-provincial conference, the Dominion Government should
show its willingness to grant a sum of money,
not to a company but to a provincial government, to aid in the construction of this railway from Quesnel to Prince George-a railway which will be of great benefit to the
people of British Columbia. This grant will
reduce by at least a million and a quarter
dollars the expenditure which the Government of British Columbia will be forced to
provide for these desperately-needed facilities.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: How much private
capital has been lost in this venture?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Oh, millions; many
millions of dollars; I could not give the precise
figure. If in 1913, when the Government of
Alberta commenced to construct the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway,
and the people of Vancouver and elsewhere
were beginning to finance the Pacific Great
Eastern Railway, those railways had been
joined, and if the participants had sat in with
officials of the Grand Trunk Pacific, now the
Canadian National, and possibly also with
Canadian Pacific Railway officials-because,
as all honourable senators know, the northern
Alberta railways are operated by the two
great railway companies in combinationnot only would British Columbia and Alberta

be today in a much better position, but these
heavy losses would not have been suffered.
The losses came about simply through frustration of effort, the impossibility of bringing
about what was intended, namely, a railway
which would connect Vancouver with Prince
Rupert and the Peace River and take care of
the great revenue-producing country in
between.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What is the intention of the
American committee which is considering a
railway to Fairbanks, Alaska? Do they intend
that it shall go through the district which
will be affected by this bonus?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, as far as Prince
George. But every dollar of the money provided for in this bill-roughly a million and
a quarter dollars-is to be expended only on
a railway from Quesnel to Prince George.
The railway proposed by Washington for
joint use by the two governments and projected into Alaska would be operated largely
for defence purposes. It will be remembered
that during the recent war, I believe in 1943,
the United States Government began a military survey from Prince George northward,
to enable them to decide on the advisability
or otherwise of building a railroad through to
Fairbanks, which would pass through Prince
George and down to Finlay Forks.
May I digress here, and take a minute of
your time, to express my thankful appreciation to the honourable the ex-Speaker (Hon.
Mr. King.) because of the fact that as long ago
as 1927, long before I thought of going back
into politics, he enabled me to accompany
him on a marvellous trip from Summit Lake,
thirty-five miles north of Prince George,
down Crooked River and Parsnip River to
Finlay Forks-to which the Finlay River
cornes from the north-and then all through
that part of British Columbia which is
traversed by the great Peace River. Years
before, it happened that I was down the other
reaches of the Peace in far northern Alberta.
I wish again to express thanks to the honourable senator because he helped to open my
eyes to what that northern country is capable
of producing if proper transportation facilities
are provided.
I understand it is the desire of the leader
of the government that this bill go to the
Committee on Transport and Communications, and when this discussion is over I shall
move that the bill be referred to that
committee.
I want it to be clearly understood that anything I have said concerning the advisability
of a railway from Prince George into the
Peace River country has nothing directly to
do with the policy of the government in connection with this bill. The railway extension

NOVEMBER 30, 1949
affected by this bill definitely ends at Prince
George. The federal government would give
a subsidy of $15,000 per mile for the eightytwo miles from Quesnel to Prince George,
and everything over and above that would
be the responsibility of the Government of
British Columbia and the people of that
province.
I feel that a few years after this railway
extension is completed, Prince George will
become one of the greatest secondary cities
It possesses almost
in western Canada.
everything that is required, provided that
the productive capacity of the country surrounding it can be brought within its reach.
Approximately twenty-five or thirty miles
from the proposed line between Quesnel and
Prince George, is the great Bowron coal belt
which is situated along the Bowron river.
I understand that businessmen are just about
ready to construct a pulp mill at Prince
George, and perhaps at Quesnel, provided
they can secure power from the coal at a low
cost. I have said nothing of the hundreds
of miles of practically semi-anthracite coal
that is awaiting development in the Peace
River district; but that will come up again.
The Prince George-Quesnel area is full of
timber for pulp and the manufacture of
newsprint, and everything else for which
timber is meant to be used. This is a great
mining country. During the last war, when
we were short of mercury, the allies were
able to secure all they required from a mine
just outside of Fort St. James, approximately
seventy or eighty miles from Prince George.
Honourable senators, I have great pleasure
in moving the second reading of this bill.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am still not satisfied
with the figure of seventy miles, given as
the distance to Squamish. My information
comes from a man who lived there for some
forty years. In his early days, travelling
with the tide in a rowboat, he used to take
his strawberries to Vancouver to be sold. He
told me that the distance was forty miles.
A highway along the bank is forty miles
long, and surely where it is possible to build
a modern highway it is also possible to
build a modern railway.
I should like to say to my honourable
friend from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) that
I would much prefer to transport my cattle
by scow than over a highway. As to cattle
taking a long ocean voyage, I remember that
in one of our committees, when discussing
the question of shipping cattle overseas, and
the loss of life resulting therefrom, the late
Senator Burns told me that he had shipped
a great number of cattle to England without

them suffering any ill effects. He said the
cattle would shrink when shipped by rail
from western Canada to Montreal, but that
with proper care and attention on the ocean
voyage they would regain all the weight
they had lost.
I do not want to detract from anything
the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) has said, and actually I am in
favour of the bill. The only difficulty I see
is that it is the north country they want to
get to.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I notice that this bill is
cited as the Pacific Great Eastern Railway
Aid Act, and that the grant is to be made
to the government of the province of British
Columbia. Does the province own the
railway?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The province completely
owns the railway.

I think this is good legislation, because if
any employee of His Majesty is unfortunate
enough to sufTer injury or contract an
industrial disease in the course of his
employment in Prince Edward Island, it will
no longer be necessary to refer to the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have no objection to having the bill referred
to one of our standing committees; but as it
originated in this bouse and is relatively
simple, I should like it to receive third reading as soon as possible. Therefore, I move
third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FISH INSPECTION BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 63, an Act respecting
the Inspection of Fish and Marine Plants.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have asked the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McKeen) to handle this bill.
Hon. S. S. McKeen moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, before going
into the detail of the bill itself, I should like
to say a few words about the industry and
what it means to this country.
As far as cabinet posts are concerned, that
of Minister of Fisheries bas been used as a
football for quite a few years. It has very
often been the first post of a new Minister,
who has stayed in the department for a
matter of a few months or a year and then
has moved on to another post. The result has
been that real headway in the department
has been greatly retarded. We have had
excellent men in the department, and had they
stayed longer I am sure our Canadian fishing
industry would have attained a much higher
level.
When the Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe
was Minister of Marine and Fisheries he
made history by signing, on behalf of Canada,
the Halibut Treaty between Canada and the
United States. This was the first treaty that
Canada negotiated in ber own name, all
treaties prior to that time having been made
in the name of the United Kingdom on behalf

of Canada. As a consequence of that treaty
the halibut fishing industry on the Pacific
Coast has been preserved, for every year
a set amount of fish is taken and sold, and
there is no trouble about the depletion of this
particular fishery. This shows the wisdom of
the action taken at that time.
The next fishing treaty to be signed was
the Sockeye Salmon Treaty, negotiated in
1930. As is well known to the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) a past chairman and at present a member of the International Pacific Salmon
Fisheries Commission, the purpose of the
treaty was to rehabilitate the sockeye salmon
run in the Fraser river. An excellent job
has been done in this regard and the results
are apparent already in the increase of the
Fraser river catch.
Most recent figures indicate that Canada,
including Newfoundland, stands eighth among
the countries of the world in fish production,
and first in terms of value of exports of fishery products. Norway exports a greater
tonnage of fish than Canada, but the Canadian
products, particularly salmon, halibut and
lobster, have a higher value.
Honourable members may be interested in
a few figures showing the value of Canada's
fish exports in the last few years. They are
as follows:
1920-29

..............................

1930-39

..............................

1943 .................................
1945 .................................
1948 .................................

$33,199,241

25,535,543
60,313,127
84,800,563
89,843,000

I may say that the exports of fishery products
from Newfoundland in 1948 were worth
$34,128,839, and these were not included in
the Canadian figures for that year. Incidentally, this $34 million represents approximately 36 per cent of Newfoundland's total
exports. The total 1949 exports of fish
products, including Newfoundland, should
exceed $110 million.
The distribution of exports of Canadian
fishery products in 1948, by main destinations, was as follows:
U .S .A . .....................................
United Kingdom .......................
British Colonies ....................
South Africa .............................

The British colonies referred to in the table
are mostly the British West Indies, for I
might say that we are practically shut out
of the markets of Australia and New Zealand.

SENATE
The Latin American countries would include
the British West Indies Islands that are not
in the sterling bloc.
In 1948 Canada's total exports of all
products amounted to $3,075 million, of which
fishery products accounted for about $90
million, or slightly less than 3 per cent of
the total.
The following table gives the per capita
consumption of fish in a number of countries:

(post-war) 22-4

From these figures it can be seen that
our consumption of fish in Canada is very
low. If it were possible to increase the consumption of fish on the North American
continent by one pound per capita, our fishing industry would not have to bother with
any export market other than the United
States, for the demand would exceed the
present supply. So I think the fisheries
industry, if pushed ahead and helped by a
real program of expansion, would show more
promise of growth than almost any other
industry in Canada.
As I have said, in the past some ministers
have remained in the department for only a
short time and consequently have not been
able to give leadership to any endeavour
of this kind. A few years ago we had as
minister a bright young man from New Brunswick, the Honourable Mr. Bridges, who laid
the groundwork for a re-organization and the
starting of an aggressive program, but unfortunately he died not long after he took
over the office and before he had time to do
much.
The present minister, the Honourable Mr.
Mayhew, has taken a really keen interest in
the department. He is a successful businessman who went West in his early days, as
some Easterners did-for not all of them
stayed in the East. I believe Mr. Mayhew
was born within a few miles of this chamber.
He lived for a while on the prairies, where
he was very successful, but I presume he
could not resist the attractions of British
Columbia's beautiful climate, and he moved
on to that province and became even more
successful in business. When he entered
the government he sold out his business
interests, and is devoting himelf to the job
of running his department. I am sure he could
have had some other portfolio if he had
wanted it, but he feels that he owes a duty
to his present department and to the fisheries
industry, because of the co-operation they

have given him, and he now has under way
a splendid program for the industry. This
bill is one of the results of that program.
The minister has induced the fisheries
industry in British Columbia to spend about
$300,000 on advertising its products, in an
effort to increase Canadian demand and get
away from the low average consumption of
twelve pounds per capita. I think that low
average consumption is due principally to
the condition of the fish as it reaches the
markets in those parts of the country which
are at considerable distance from either of
our coasts. In Halifax and Vancouver, for
example, the per capita consumption averages
somewhere between thirty and thirty-five
pounds, which is comparable to that of the
United Kingdom; but in the central parts
of Canada the consumption goes down very
considerably.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The brains there go
down too.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: We will not argue about
that. Some people say that we who live
on the coast eat more fish because we need
it to build up our brains.
In case it should be thought that the lower
consumption in Central Canada is a result of
higher prices that have to be charged because
of shipping costs, I would point out that the
freight charge from the East coast to Montreal
is only about half a cent a pound, and to
Toronto not much more. To Winnipeg it is
possibly a little higher; but in the prairie
provinces they have a good supply of fresh
water fish. In fact, Canada has probably
the biggest inland fisheries of any country
in the world. These combined with our great
salt water fisheries on the Atlantic and
Pacific Coasts ensure a tremendous volume
of production, and we have the whole North
American market right on our doorstep.
In order to see whether the price of fish
had anything to do with per capita consumption I have made a check at various
places. I find that fish selling in Halifax
at 34 cents a pound sells at Montreal for 35
cents, and at Toronto for 38 cents. This
confirms my opinion that the lower consumption in Central Canada is brought about by
the condition of the fish as placed on the
market. A program has now been started to
make sure that fish for this market is
properly treated at the places where it is
caught, then frozen by the best modern
equipment and shipped inland under the
protection of up-to-date facilities, so that it
will reach the retailer and the ultimate consumer in first-class condition.
Another step is being taken. Honourable
members may be interested to know that the

DECEMBER 1, 1949
department will shortly be opening a kitchen
at Ottawa, over in the West Block. In fact it
is almost ready for opening now. Instruction will be given there in the best methods
of preparing fish for the table, and it is hoped
that thereby the demand for fish in Canada as
a whole will be greatly increased.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How will pupils Jbe obtained
from all over Canada?
Hon. Mr. Nicol: By advertising.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Kitchens will be opened
in various parts of the country, in the Maritimes, in Central Canada, on the Prairies and
on the West Coast. As a matter of fact,
fishing companies in British Columbia are
now working on plans for a kitchen in Vancouver, in order to demonstrate various ways
by which fish may be more tastefully prepared
for city tables.
The purpose of this bill is to tighten up
regulations for the inspection and grading of
fish. If it is thought that some features of the
bill are too drastic, it will be found that similar provisions are contained in agricultural
Acts, the Meat and Canned Foods Act and
other laws governing the inspection of foods.
After this bill is passed the department will
be able to put into force regulations ensuring
that Canadian fish, wherever sold-on the
markets of this country or abroad-will be in
good condition.
If honourable senators would like detailed
explanations of any sections of the bill I shall
be glad to give whatever information I can in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Can the honourable gentleman give us the fish production of each
province?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I have not got that information, but I will have it for my honourable
friend in committee.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I would like to know
what Saskatchewan's production is. We ship
to New York and Eastern Canada many carloads of white fish and pickerel.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I believe that the annual
shipments from the Prairies to the United
States have a value of $2 million. I am
speaking from memory.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I would like to ask the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McKeen) whether this bill covers canned
fish as well as other kinds. I do not see canned
fish mentioned in the bill.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The bill provides for
inspection of fish up to the time that it is put
into cans. Inspection after that is provided
for under the Meat and Canned Foods Act.

Hon. Antoine J. Leger: Honourable senators, I wish to make a few observations on
this bill.
Chapter 72 of the Revised Statutes, which
this bill proposes to repeal, provides in
section 6 that an inspector of fish shall, before
assuming his duties, take an oath that he will
not directly or indirectly engage in or in any
way carry on the business of trading or
dealing in fish or fish containers. I do not
know whether it is an oversight on the part
of the draftsman, but this section is not
re-incorporated in the bill. It is proposed to
appoint inspectors according to law, which
I take to mean according to the Civil Service
Act. Now that Act provides for an oath of
allegiance, an oath of secrecy and such other
oaths as may be required by statute. This
bill, when passed, would repeal chapter 72 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, leaving no
oath to be taken by an inspector, except the
two specifically provided for by the Civil
Service Act.
Instead of repealing the whole Act, the
bill should repeal the Act except for section 6.
Oiherwise, I think that section 6 should be
reinstated. It seems to me that if inspectors
are to be given power to arrest without a
warrant and to seize fish on mere suspicion
and detain it for two months, they should
take the oath that they will not either directly
or indirectly engage in the business of trading
in fish. The inspectors to be appointed may
not all be like Caesar's wife, above reproach.
I think that it would be safer to make provision for the taking of the oath, as provided
for in the original Act.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I cannot say whether that particular provision was left out of the bill deliberately
or not. I may say, however, that fish inspectors have never exercised the right to make
arrests. The Act has contained that provision since 1914, but it has only been necessary to threaten arrest to get the desired
co-operation from suspected offenders. It
happened in one case fish were being transported by truck. The inspector considered
the product unfit for human consumption and
the trucker refused to give his name and
was about the remove the fish from the jurisdiction of the officer. The inspector then
threatened to remove the truck to the police
station and have the operator detained there,
but upon threat of arrest the trucker readily
gave his name and residence to the inspector.
As to fishery plants, it has never become
necessary for an inspector to even threaten
arrest in order to carry out his duties. I do
not think there is any real danger to be feared

SENATE
from that provision, because if an inspector
were to hold fish for two months they certainly would not be fit for sale.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask whether the
bill applies to lobsters and oysters, as well as
to other fish?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It covers all fish, including shellfish. The bill has reference also to
sea moss and other marine plants.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it seems to me that the fundamental
function of the Senate is to protect the
minority, even though that minority may
consist of only one person. Looking after
the rights of the individual is our special
province, and we should give it every consideration. I frequently see legislation going
through parliament which offends my sense
of responsibility towards the rights of the
individual.
This bill contains a most drastic provision.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What page?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will my friend look at
page 3? As I understand it, an inspector
under this measure cannot be compared to
an inspector of police, who is a superior
officer in a law enforcement body. In this
instance an inspector is a person who looks
at, smells and otherwise inspects fish to see
whether or not it is fit for human consumption and is packed in accordance with regulations. I would think that would be work
for a retired fisherman or someone familiar
with the industry, rather than for a man who
is a superior officer in an organization for
the enforcement of the law.
Section 4 (1) (b) provides:

to demand of me, as a shipper or packer in
this industry, the right to inspect my books
and carry away what information he wishes;
and there is no provision that he must keep
it secret.
The bill provides for powers with respect
to arrest that I think are both extreme and
extravagant. I do not see why an inspector
of fish should be authorized to put a man
under arrest. True, he can only keep him
under arrest for twenty-four hours before
bringing him before a magistrate; but why
should the inspector be allowed to arrest
people on sight?
I am not in the fish industry and I know
little about it, though I eat the product sometimes, but I question the right of an inspector
to seize fish because of an infraction of the
Act or its regulations. Would it not be sufficient for him to seize fish only when they
are unfit for human consumption? But let
there be any infraction of the provisions of
the bill or the regulations made thereunder,
and the fish are, ipso facto, seized, for power
is given to the inspector to make the
seizure. I am inclined to think that officials
who accept responsibility under these circumstances sometimes get a little over-zealous.
They are very serious about the performance
of their duties, and may go a little too far
if the bill provides them with more power
than is strictly necessary. The Senate is here
for the very purpose of keeping that kind of
thing in check.
I suppose the bill will be referred to a
committee and taken up there, but I would
like to put on record my objection to drastic
legislation of this kind in the handling of an
important industry, such as that of fishing.

An inspector may at any time
(b) require to be produced for inspection or for
the purpose of obtaining copies thereof or extracts
therefrom any books, shipping bills, bills of lading,
or other documents or papers.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: I would say that the
intention of the department is to obtain books
relating to the shipment of fish, not to the
operation of the company. Paragraph (b)
speaks of shipping bills, bills of lading, and
that sort of thing. The powers of fisheries
inspectors are in effect the same as those conferred on inspectors under the Meat and
Canned Foods Act, the Animal Contagious
Diseases Act, and certain agricultural acts. If
in the opinion of honourable senators the
section is not properly worded, it can be
changed in committee. I may say that there
has been no case of arrest by departmental
action in this connection since 1914.

I can understand an inspector of fish wanting
to see a bill of lading or other related documents; but why should he require an examination of the books of a shipper? That
provision does not strike me as being in line
with the activities one would expect from a
fish inspector. I can see no reason why, if
I were in the fish business, an inspector
should have a right to know what I have
invested in my business, what profits I make,
or who I buy from or to whom I sell my
products. Those are things which are private
to me, and it is not necessary that they be
known in order to appraise the quality of my
fish. I know that those who advocate the
bill say that it is not the intention to do what
I have indicated. But I would point out that
the bill gives authority to a mere inspector

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then that power is not
needed.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
I am in full sympathy with the Department
of Fisheries in their endeavours to raise the
standard of fish sold for consumption in
Canada and abroad. We do not need to go

DECEMBER 1, 1949
further than our parliamentary restaurant
to realize that there is room for improvement.
I am familiar with the canned fish industry,
and what I say will be in connection with the
processing of fish that are canned.
I have every confidence in the present
fisheries administration. The minister and
deputy minister are doing an excellent job.
I agree with everything the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen)
has said concerning the Honourable Mr.
Mayhew. But administrations come and go,
and this honourable body is charged, I think,
with carefully scrutinizing any legislation
that seems extraordinary. As far as this bill
is concerned, I am all in favour of giving the
department full power to deal promptly and
efficiently with every law-breaker, and also
to ensure that only the very best fish possible
are placed on the market for human consumption at home and abroad. I know that
discretion will be exercised by our present
administrators in carrying out the provisions
of this Act. But what of the future? This
measure will become statute law, and the
regulations under it could be greatly varied
and made extremely stringent by some
future administration, and every fishery
officer would be free to act in accordance
with the law as it stands.
By section 3 it is proposed to give power to
the Governor in Council to make regulations
prescribing grades, quality and standards of fish;
respecting the processing, storing, grading, packaging, marketing, transporting and inspection of fish;
also respecting the quality and specifications for
containers of fish and the marking and inspection
of such containers.

As far as canned fish is concerned, there
are only two grades: the top grade, for human
consumption, and the grade that goes into
fish-meal, fertilizer, and so forth.
It may be quite proper to have two or
three grades of grain, apples or potatoes;
but a fish is a fish. Man cannot improve on
nature, and the job of the processor of fish
is to preserve what nature gives us. To retain
its freshness and tastiness, a fish has to be
treated almost immediately after it comes out
of the water, and the only canned fish that
should be sold for human consumption is the
very top grade,-by which I mean fish that
are absolutely fresh when treated or
processed.
If fish are fresh to start with, and are
processed and canned properly, they will be
good when opened up. Therefore inspection
should be at the processing or canning plants,
and processing of fish that are stale or have
started to deteriorate should not be allowed.
There is the fountain-head of the trouble; it
is there that the trouble should be nipped in
the bud. It is ruinous for the fish business to

try to sell stale or second-grade fish for
human consumption. People buy it, and then
many slow up on eating fish of any kind, at
least for the time being. We in this country
must build up the fish business by giving the
people the very best fish, and none other,
as far as processing goes. If fish are not
treated promptly after they come out of the
water, they deteriorate: the fibre breaks down,
the juices run out, and when one looks at
them through the microscope the fiesh
resembles cotton wool; also the taste is flat
or without flavour.
Those who have made a success of the
canned fish business have done it through
their labels. A label should be a badge of
quality, honesty and integrity, so that people
will know that behind it is the best fish available, and that the quality is guaranteed to
stand up under ordinary circumstances in
any part of the world. We have many firms
throughout Canada that are proud of their
labels, because they indicate the very top
quality. If for the purpose of government
grading of canned fish the figures 1-2-3 were
to take the place of these labels, it would be
a great step backward, and entirely illogical,
because, as I have said, the top grade is the
only grade of fish that is fit for human consumption. Anything below that grade should
go for stock food. Fish are either fresh or
they are not fresh-there is no middle state.
Section 7 states that whenever an inspector
suspects, "on reasonable grounds"-which of
course means in his opinion-that an offence
against this part or any regulation has been
committed, he may seize all fish and containers and may hold them for a period of two
months or more. Why two months? The wording of the old Fisheries Act, which required
him to "proceed with all convenient dispatch",
would seem far more practical. The fish
affected by his action may be under a sales
contract. We are anxious to get American
dollars, and fish which have been contracted
for may be due for delivery by certain dates
-or they may have been sold under a letter
of credit. If delivery is not made on time the
order would be subject to cancellation. Or
space might be contracted for on a vessel, and
even if the fish were not shipped on the boat
the space would have to be paid for.
Section 8 provides:
An inspector or constable may arrest without a
warrant any person found committing an offence
under this part, and shall forthwith take any person
so arrested before a Justice of the Peace to be
examined and deait with according to law.

A person so arrested may be detained twentyfour hours, perhaps in jail, before being
brought before a magistrate or some other
judicial officer. Why twenty-four hours? In
most parts of our country a magistrate can be

SENATE

reached quickly. There are a few isolated
spots along our coasts where the process of
law might take a week, or even ten days. It
seems to me that the phrase "as expeditiously
as possible", employed in the National
Defence Bill, is preferable to fixing a period
of twenty-four hours.
Section 4 was referred to by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). It would enable any inspector to
take copies of any extracts, any books, shipping bills, bills of lading or other documents
and papers. I understand from the department that what is meant here is documents
in connection with shipments. It is agreed
that this means that they can take copies of
any processes, financial or cost statements,
and statements with regard to processing fish.
Many firms have special processes which they
have laboured hard over the years to perfect, and certainly they would not want those
processes, which in some cases may be a trade
secret, passed around to everybody. Neither
would they want their financial statements or
cost statements passed around. In any event
I cannot see what use these documents would
be to the inspector in carrying out his
ordinary duties.
I am in agreement with the principle of
the bill, but I think it can stand some amendment and still give the Fisheries Department
all the powers needed for efficient operation.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, as
to the seizing of the fish, I may say that this
section, which was incorporated into the Act
in 1945, was carefully considered in the committee of another place. Under certain other
Acts the inspector bas the power to confiscate
the product in question, but this bill does not
confer that power. The inspector has the right
of seizure, but the confiscation is done by the
courts.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I want to point out that something more than
the fish needs inspection, and that is the
industry itself. The prices charged the fish
consumer are much too high. For instance,
in Halifax, which is right on the edge of the
sea where the fish is caught, we are paying
prices that are exorbitant.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: There must be a combine.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: My honourable friend is
getting a little ahead of me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What about the wages?
Can they stand inspection?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The wages also require
inspection. I am going to suggest to the government, through its leader in the Senate, that
we need an investigation into the fish industry
as well as into the flour-milling industry. My

information is that right in Halifax there is a
combine of the leading fish exporters. They
have formed a sort of protective association,
and have fixed the prices to be paid to the
producer. The poor fisherman, who in all
kinds of weather has to endure the risks and
hazards of one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, is forced to take whatever
price this monopoly fixes for his fish.
It is rather opportune that Tuesday's edition
of the Halifax Chronicle-Herald should have
published an editorial entitled "It Isn't
'Lowly' any More." It reads as follows:
Time was when the "lowly" codfish was one of
the cheaper articles of diet in this part of the world
-cod, fresh, pickled, or dried.
But it isn't a cheap article of food any more.
According to market quotations, dry codfish is
priced, retail at 27 cents a pound, whole fish; or
40 cents a pound with the bone removed.
What becomes now of "cheap" fish-and-chips or
equally "cheap" codfish-and-pork-scraps?
The retail price of codfish (dry) used to range
from 5 to 6 and 7 cents a pound. But today, this
basic food is priced out of the market-"out of this
world," as a new generation would say.
Why? This newspaper does not profess to have
the answer. Perhaps the answer is a good one,
adequate and reasonable. But we do know that in
this capital city of a fishing province, 27 cents
a pound for ordinary dry codfish is pretty fantastic.
And people who buy codfish at that price would
like to be assured that the fishermen are getting an
adequate share of the consumer's dollar.

This should answer the question raised by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
My information is that there is a monopoly,
and I would point out that a certain condition
exists in Halifax that should not be tolerated. The recently appointed vice-consul for
both the Dominican Republic and the
Republic of Haiti is one of the most prominent
fish merchants of Halifax, and if I were an
independent exporter or shipper all my
invoices would have to go to this competitor.
He would learn my prices and acquire the
names of my clientele, and he would naturally

use this information to benefit himself and
his associates. This condition should no
longer be tolerated. We should be free to
enjoy open competition, and the independent
fish exporter should be given every opportunity to secure markets for his product
without having to supply his competitors with
information as to his prices and custbmers.
The high price of fish in Halifax bas long
been a grievance among the fish consumers
there, and I would suggest to the leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that
ho bring my remarks, and the editorial I have
quoted, to the attention of the Minister of
Fisheries. If the minister is as good a man as
my honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McKeen) insists he is, I am sure he will
instigate an investigation into the fishing
industry of the Maritime Provinces.

DECEMBER 1. 1949
Somne Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Sa f ar as the price of
fish is concerned, I should be very surprised
ta learn that the fish buyers are able ta set
the price at any time. Perhaps they do 50
in the Maritimes, but I know that in British
Columbia it is the labour unions who negotiate with the packers and establish the price
ta be paid the fishermen.
Han. Mr. Quinn: That may be so on the
west coast, but not in the East.
Hon. Mr. McIn±yre: May I ask the honourable senator fromn Bedford-Halifax (Han. Mr.
Quinn) if he was talking about dried and
boneless codfish?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Yes, dTied and pickled.
Han. Mr. McIntyre: I presumned sa, because
even though Prince Edward Island is a fishproducing province, we get a lot of boneless
codfish from Halifax at 27 and 28 cents a
pound.
I should like ta cali attention ta the fact
that when a hundred-paund fish is caught it
has to be salted and cured for ten days. At
the end of this periad the fish weighs anly
sixty-five pounds. Then it must be dried,
and this process reduces the original weight
ta thirty-three pounds. After it is finally
skinned and boned it weighs only about
twenty pounds.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Yes, that applies ta processed fish; but what I had in mind was
fresh fish baught fromn the fisherman at five
or six cents a pound and retailed in Halifax
for thirty cents a pound.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senatars,
1 arn sure that we are all in sympathy with
the purpart of the bull. We realize, as does
the Minister of Fisheries, that there should
be a greater cansumptian of fish in this
country.
If anythîng needs ta be inspected, it is
fish. On the Canadian market-I will nat
mention any special locality-you can see
fish that should nat be offered for sale. And,
as honourable senatars knaw, even at the
Parliamentary Restaurant you may be given
fish of a variety diff erent from the one yau
ask for. 0f course, people who do not know
one kind of fish from, another will accept what
is given them.
Somne kinds of fish are put up in this country by methods that make the fish almost
indigestible.
Certain
fish described
as
"smoked"' is in fact painted with an acid.
We must realize that, human nature being
what it is, same people will seil anything s0
long they can make a profit on it. Therefore,

steps have ta be taken ta curb the greed that
is responsible for the marketing of poor
quality fish.
I well remember the time, as no doubt
every other senator does, when one would
flot order an egg in a restaurant for fear
that it might contain a chick, or something
elZe. When the Department of Agriculture
got after farmers and tightened up restrictions there was a loud protest that it was
wrong ta interfere in this way with the rights
of men. Yet, what is the situation today?
On the markets of the world Canada's reputation for good eggs is so enviable that înspectors from Southern Ireland, Denmark and
Great Britain came over here this year ta
find out what methods we used ta produce
such a high quality.
We can bring about similar resuits in the
fish industry by enforcing inspection ta make
sure that consumers get good quality fish.
0f course there will be protests from some
people, but we ail know that the consumption
of fish will neyer be as high as it should be
50 long as poor grades are off ered ta the
public on markets throughout the country.
If a persan who buys a piece of fish in a
store finds an getting home that it has a poor
taste, he is flot likely ta go back for more
fish for quite a while.
It may be necessary ta make some changes
in the bill in commîttee, but I believe we al
recognize that the bill represents a step
forward by the Department of Fisheries in
its effort ta improve the quality of fish offered
for sale and thereby ta increase consumption
in Canada.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill
was read the second time.

and must inevitably deal with a variety of
problems arising in this comparatively new
field of government activity.
It will be
remembered that in the bill brought before
us last session special emphasis was laid
upon the need for additional housing units
for rent. I think that if this bill may be
identified by one specific fcature more than
another it would be by its recognition of the
desirability of increasing facilities for making
home ownership possible.
I think that, considering all the conditions
that affected this country during and after
the war, the National Housing Act has in
general been good legislation. It has made
available dominion credit to assist individuals who wish to build their own houses,
and has facilitated the acquisition of land.
It also has encouraged the promotion of many
rental projects, as well as enterprises contributing to the private ownership of houses.
Also, through the experience gained in the
administration of the corporation under this
Act, there has been developed a group of
public servants who are as valuable and useful to this country as anyone on the government payroll; I refer particularly to Mr.
Mansur and his associates.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
SECOND READING
On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 142, an Act to amend the
National Housing Act, 1944.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to handle this
bill.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the National
Housing Act has become a kind of hardy and
growing perennial in our legislative garden.
Every session since the Act was first passed
we have had before us a bill providing for
certain amendments, and I believe that those
set out in the bill now before us are the
most important of all so far. In another
place the bill was subjected to thorough discussion on second reading, in Committee of
the Whole and on third reading, but I think
it is correct to say that it was well received
there.
I suppose it is only natural that a national
housing statute should be amended from time
to time, if for no other reason than to enable
us to keep pace with changing conditions
and to profit from the growing experience of
the corporation which administers the Act

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think their grasp of
the problems thrust upon this country as a
result of the war, and their unfailing industry
in examining and trying to co-ordinate the
various elements concerned, deserves the
highest commendation.
They have been
actuated by the prevailing idea of the government: that the purpose of the Act is not to
usurp the field of building construction, but
to stimulate private enterprise with a view
to meeting the demands for accommodation,
and in time to effect the re-establishment of
the building industry as the sole agency in
meeting these demands.
There is every indication at present that
before long the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation will be a financing rather
than a building body. The figures given by
the minister in the other place show that
more than 61 per cent of all building in the
past year was done under private auspices,
and that the remainder was carried out with
government aid.
We should note the progress made in meeting the housing needs in this country since
we discussed the question last year. More
than 80,000 housing units were completed in
1948, and the preliminary figures indicate
that almost 100,000 units will be completed in
1949.
Perhaps the most significant feature of 1949
is that for the first time the volume of new

believe only six-retired members of the
Mounted Police. These men had formerly
been on provincial police forces, and at the
time of joining the Mounted Police were
required to make contributions to that organization's pension fund in order to be eligible
for superannuation upon retirement. On
account of the scarcity of men during the
war, they were retained for longer than the
normal period of service, and they are now
entitled to some refund because of excess
contributions made by them. The bill will
enable the government to make the necessary
refunds.
Hon. Mr. King: Have all the men retired
from the force?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: They have all retired
and are now on pension.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DECEMBER 1, 1949
housing units is in excess of what is known
as the net family formations. In making that
statement it is not suggested that the housing
needs of Canada have been entirely met, but
one must emphasize the fact that we are now
more than meeting our current needs and are
making some progress towards the establishment of a backlog to meet requirements. As
I have already stated, the policy of the government in all these activities has been to
rely upon private enterprise, and only to the
extent that it requires assistance in the
housing field.
During 1949, bouses built on account of the
federal government-such as veterans' rental
projects, married quarters for personnel of
the Department of National Defence and
others-account for about 14 per cent of all
construction. Another 25 per cent of this
year's program will be financed under the
National Housing Act. The remaining 61 per
cent, as I have mentioned, will consist of
structures built without government sponsorship of any kind.
I now come to the amendments contained
in the bill, only one of which covers an
entirely new field, that of dominion-provincial relations. This amendment appears in
the last section of the bill. The other proposed changes extend functions already
defined in the Act.
As the explanatory notes to the bill make
perfectly clear, there are four major changes,
two of which appear in clause 2. Clause 6
has to do with increased loans under the
home improvement plan, and clause 9 makes
provision for the acquisition of land for
housing purposes through the joint effort of
the dominion and the provinces.
Immediately following the war, prospective owners had little trouble in financing
down payments. Gratuities, re-establishment
grants and funds from other sources made it
possible for a great many people to become
home-owners, even where the down payment
ranged between $1,500 and $2,500. As the
situation is now materially changed, it is felt
that the level of National Housing Act loans
should be increased, and that the down payment should be correspondingly decreased. It
is proposed, therefore, under clause 2 that a
basic loan of 80 per cent of the land value
be made to the home-owner or to the builder
who intends to sell to a home-owner. If the
owner secures the property at a fair and
reasonable price, an additional loan of onesixth of the basic loan may be made.
The minister in another place emphasized
the importance of the provision relating to a
"fair and reasonable" price. This more generous financial assistance given under clause
2 might, it is thought, have the effect of

increasing the price of houses. As a safeguard against such increase, the bonus loan
of one-sixth of the 80 per cent loan will be
made only when the corporation is satisfied
that the price at which the proposed owner
buys the property is fair and reasonable.
Under present conditions it is easier to sell
a bouse for $8,000 with $1,000 down than for
$7,000 with a $2,000 down payment. The
"fair and reasonable" proviso is introduced
because little good would be done if, by
increasing the mortgage loan, the sale price
of the house were increased, with the net
result that the home-owner would have a
large down payment to make and a larger
loan to carry. If honourable senators feel so
inclined, the details concerning this change
can be examined further in committee, where,
I believe, the chief officials of the corporation will be ready to furnish information
such as they have always supplied generously
in the past. In general, the proposal is to
increase the level of mortgage loans to homeowners so that they will be able to buy a
house with a down-payment of approximately
one-sixth of the sale price. This bas the
effect of reducing present requirements as to
down-payments by about one-half.
The other change under clause 2, to which
I would refer, bas to do with the re-definition
of co-operative groups and the character of
the enterprise undertaken by such associations. Hitherto co-operative groups have
been afraid to undertake building projects
because of the risk of being jointly and
severally liable. By this amendment it is
proposed that a group of people who are
interested in undertaking to build together
in a co-operative way, and in occupying the
houses themselves, may be relieved of the
onus of joint and several responsibility so
that if any losses occur they will not be collectively liable, but individually liable, each
for his own proportion of the deficiency in
the mortgage account.
The clauses between 2 and 9, which I do
not think it is necessary for me to go into at
this time, have to do largely with procedural
matters in relation to the mortgage corporation and the Department of Finance. Clause 6,
however, is for the purpose of increasing the
amount of loans for home improvements.
This section will be put into force by proclamation of the Governor in Council when
materials which are now scarce have become
more abundant and permit of the application
of this provision.
The major change proposed by this bill is
the establishment of a dominion-provincial
arrangement whereunder the two governments may assist in the development of housing. The federal government may join with
a provincial government in projects to

SENATE
assemble land, and arrange for houses to be
built for sale or for rent. The experience of
the last few years has shown very clearly
that governmental
in the housing
field, to be fully effective, requires the participation of the provinces. As everyone here
knows, there have been arguments back and
forth as to whether the provinces should
assume responsibility for building enterprises
or whether the sole responsibility should rest
with the dominion. Without developing the
proposal in great detail, I may say that the
effect of the amendment is to make the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
the co-operating agent, with similar co-operating agencies in the provinces. It is my information that, except in Quebec and Alberta,
the ground is already laid for procedure along
these lines. The condition which it will help
to create more than any other is the availability of new areas of land outside the
bounds of municipalities, where building projects can be undertaken. For example, during
the past year, within the bounds of the city
of Toronto itself, the number of houses built
is only twenty-six; and the demand for new
residences and living places has resulted of
course in all sorts of undertakings in the territory immediately adjoining, in the townships
in the county of York. But there, the cost of
servicing-of laying down water mains and
sewerage and of providing all the other
services which a municipality has to supply
in connection with a new district is too great
for ahy iiiuiiuipaiy to bear alone. .t is to
meet that situation that this amendment is
suggested. In effect it is enabling legislation:
it will enable a province, upon the request
of a municipality to meet a condition which
exists in that municipality, to go to the dominion and find the way already paved for
co-operation in dealing with these matters.
As far as I am concerned, the main feature
of this bill is the gratifying evidence of
co-operation between the dominion and the
provinces, and particularly on a matter which
means the betterment of living conditions
amongst our people. That is the feature of
the bill which commended it to the other
house and gave it such a wide degree of
acceptance.
In conclusion I should like to raise one
point which was not mentioned in the other
place, namely, the significance of this enterprise from the financial and economic point of
view. If this bill is passed, it will mean that
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation will have had isomething like $300 millions to devote to this work. The amount
which has been spent already in loans exceeds
$100 millions. The extent to which a supply
of houses of different kinds is being given to
the people of this country during a period
|assistance

when costs are high and materials scarce, and
therefore expensive, raises the whole question
of this country's ability to pay. The financial
and economic phases of this administration
are one thing, and the social betterment
involved is another. This Act has been in
effect now for the last five years, so it is quite
obvious that it is the desire of Canadians to
meet social conditions and not to count the
cost. Members in both houses should appreciate the fact that this is an equation, with
the financial and economie considerations on
one side and the social betterment of our
people on the other. Anyone can predict the
future conditions of this country as well as
I can, but I have little doubt that within a
year or two our economie and financial outlook will be different from that of the past
three or four years.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I hesitate to interrupt my
honourable friend at this point, but I should
like to ask whether the government makes
any inspection of the houses which are built
under this government housing scheme? One
constantly hears the complaint that many of
the houses are of poor quality, that the roofs
leak and the doors do not fit. I am wondering
whether the government makes any inspection of these houses.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There is a provision for
the inspection of these houses. This point
was raised in the other place, and the Minister made it quite clear that the inspections
undertaken by the agents of the corporation
were made for the protection and security of
the mortgagee. However, it is also the
responsibility of the owner or prospective
owner to see that the quality of the house
is up to standard. There is a tendency on the
part of people building under this scheme to
lean entirely upon the state, but the administrators of the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation certainly do not encourage this
attitude.
To conclude the point upon which I was
speaking, the whole undertaking of the
National Housing Act is one of enlightenment,
and marks a new pathway for the people of
this country. It is identified with what we
may call social security and social welfare;
and in my opinion, so long as we have wars
such as the last one and countries like ours
are precipitated into them through no fault
of their own, the consequences must be met
by measures of this kind. This is my answer
to the points which may be raised about the
ultimate cost that will fall upon our taxpayers.
Honourable senators, taking everything by
and large, I think this experiment has been
well worth while and has saved Canada a
good deal of trouble. Now that we are

DECEMBER 1, 1949
beginning to see the light of day in the matter
of supply and demand, I think we can feel
the utmost gratification over the administration of this Act.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I shall not delay the house at any great
length, and I shall certainly not speak as long
as did the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.
Lambert).
I am not so sure that the honourable senator
told the house just what the bill entails.
I admit he told us in general terms, but I shall
try to illustrate what I mean. I shall not deal
with home improvement, because I am in
agreement with it. I feel that money spent
to improve homes, by converting them into
duplexes and effecting other alterations which
bring the owner more remuneration, is money
well spent.
The honourable senator said that there was
going to be a reduction in the cash deposit
required. Let me illustrate what this will
mean. On a house which is being purchased
for $10,000 the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation will lend $8,000. This constitutes
the first mortgage, and leaves a balance of
$2,000, but this measure further provides that
the government will take, as a second mortgage, one-sixth of the $8,000, which leaves
approximately $1,350. In other words, the
purchaser of the $10,000 home has to put up
only $650 in cash. I do not believe any
business can be operated successfully on such
a small margin, particularly when it is faced
with the very things my honourable friend
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) suggests
lie ahead.
Hon. Mr. Davies: There is a loan value
there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The loan value is $10,000.
The Housing Corporation lends 80 per cent of
the loan value.
Hon. Mr. Davies: That is the final cost of
the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If you want to build a house
under this plan you apply to the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation; you produce plans for, say, a $10,000 house, and the
corporation makes a reasonable effort to see
that it is built according to plan. The house
is to cost $10,000 and the housing corporation
lends 80 per cent of this amount which is
$8,000; then the government lends one-sixth
of that amount, which comes to approximately
$1,350, and the purchaser has got to put up
$650 or $675 as a cash payment. If you wish
to estimate the cost of a $6,000 home, it is done
in exactly the same way. In any event, the
purchaser of the $10,000 home has only got
$600 or $700 of his own money invested-and
I believe the amortization is over a thirtyyear period.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would the honourable
senator permit me to interrupt? On a $6,000
home the loan would be $4,800, and one-sixth,
or $800, on top of that loan would make a
total of $5,600.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But all the purchaser would
pay would be $400.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: No. You are forgetting
the fair and reasonable amount.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not care what you say,
here is what happens. The man who is going
to build the house goes to the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation and submits his plans and specifications, and inquires,
"How much will you loan me on this house,
provided it is built according to these plans?"
He is told that on a $6,000 house he will
get $4,800.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Has he not got to provide
the lot?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, that is part of the total
cost. Lots are inexpensive where I come
from; and where the honourable gentleman
on my right lives you can acquire a whole
acre, representing at least twelve goods lots
for $250.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In Toronto. The purchaser
puts up $400 on a $6,000 house.
What has been the housing experience of
the United States? A survey of housing
trends in the United States over the past 150
years shows that house prices rise and
decline over an eighteen-year period. Every
time the price rises it goes up a little higher,
and every time it drops it does not descend
quite so far. There are two reasons for that.
One is the cost of labour which, as everybody
knows, represents a large part of the cost of
all houses, especially frame houses. I am not
saying that in any spirit of criticism; I am
simply pointing it out. It is easier to increase
the price of a house than to cut down the cost
of labour, and the contractor takes the easy
way. I was a contractor in this very line of
business for twelve years, and I know that I
would pay increased wages and charge them
against the price of the house in preference
to having a fight with a union.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Is the labour cost not
95 per cent of the cost of a house?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know what the
percentage is, but it is very large. Of course,
it depends upon what you have in mind when
you are talking about labour costs. I was
thinking only of the labour employed on the

SENATE
erection of the house, not of the labour that
goes into the production of the cement,
lumber and so on.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: But that is all labour.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that.
The experience in the United States over
one hundred and fifty years is that on the
average there is a rise and fall in prices every
eighteen years--that is, prices will rise for
eight or nine or ten years and then decline
for a few years.
We are told that the government is rendering a good social service through this housing
Act. I am not objecting to that, but let us
not think that this national housing is a good
business proposition, for it is not. You cannot sell a $6,000 house for a cash payment of
$400 and get away with it. I have known
vendors to get as much as 20 per cent cash
when selling houses and yet have an awful
time trying to get the balance of their money.
And not only is the cash payment on many
of these houses too low, but the houses are
not as well built as similar houses used to be
years ago, even five years ago. Building contractors cannot make a success of their
business under these conditions. Already
three or four fairly large concerns in Winnipeg have gone broke. In some cases the
reason is not hard to find. You will see, for
instance, a row of houses-perhaps twenty,
thirty or forty-built outside the city, where
heavy expense had to be incurred to put in
water and sewerage services. The people
who buy the houses not only have to bear
these extra costs, but in order to get to their
daily work in the city they must pay higher
streetcar fares than city residents do. It is
no wonder that people who have got possession for a small down payment leave the
houses as soon as more central accommodation becomes available.
I am not preaching that depression is on
the way, but I say quite candidly that house
prices will not remain indefinitely at their
present high level. I believe the First Minister of Quebec was absolutely right when
he said that the widespread prosperity at the
time of the last election gave all the breaks
to the Liberal party. The country is still
prosperous, but we do not need to look far
back to recall when conditions were far
different. In the ten-year period prior to the
outbreak of the war houses twenty years old
could hardly be sold for what it had cost to
build them. That condition will occur again.
Here is another point. As my honourable
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
said to me the other day, we are spending
money to help people obtain houses in cities,
hbt what are we doing to provide housing

for farmers?
Now, in Manitoba and in
Ontario-and I presume also in Quebec and
the Maritime Provinces-a great deal of money
is being expended on rural electrification.
But if we are to keep our young men and
women on farms we must make it possible
for them to obtain as good housing accommodation in the country as is available in
the cities.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My honourable friend
must know that the Act provides for assistance to people who wish to build in rural
sections; but there has never been much
demand for it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So long as the demand
in the cities is as strong as it has been, no
contractor will go out to the country and
build. He would be a fool if he did.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: But the corporation has
had very few requests for assistance in the
rural sections.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The government has had
no program for encouraging building in the
country. There was very little demand for
electricity in rural Manitoba until the provincial government started its program but
as soon as a farmer here and there had his
place equipped his neighbour wanted similar
facilities, and in that way the demand
increased.
Now I wish to pass on to the question of
rentals.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the honourable
gentleman takes up that point, may I ask
him a question? Did I understand him to
say that building land within range of the
city of Toronto could be bought for $250
an acre?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think that is so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wish he would tell me
where the land is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have often seen some of it
when driving between Hamilton and Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Close to the city of
Toronto but outside the city limits a builder
is likely to have to pay from $1,000 to $2,000
for a lot large enough to put a house on.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, then, it is no wonder
that there is a housing shortage in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course, that is the
pith and substance of the trouble.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In Winnlpeg good building
land is not as high as that. A few years ago
a great deal of vacant land there was held
by the city and sold at two-thirds of its
assessed value.
Now I want to say something about housing
for rent. The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.

DECEMBER 1, 1949
Lambert) has said that the government will
endeavour to make a deal with each province
for a sharing of the cost of constructing
houses for rent. That is the only part of
the bill that interests me; it is the only
part of the bill that is any good. You are
just asking for trouble when you sell a $6,000
house to a purchaser who pays only $400
cash. The people in this country who really
need help are those who cannot buy houses,
either because they are unable to afford them
or because the nature of their employment
is such that they are subject to transfer
from one place to another. But I am not so
sure as my honourable friend is that the
provinces will be eager to join with the
federal government in the construction of
houses. They have indicated that they are
interested in the proposition, and I can
understand that, but trouble will arise
over the taxation of houses in outlying districts where schools have to be built. For
instance I know that the building of 150
houses for veterans in the Elmwood district
of Winnipeg made it necessary to add eight
or ten rooms to one of the schools.
I may be a pessimist, but I venture to
suggest that in five years from now the
government will be the largest owner of
houses in Canada. Builders in cities all
across the country will find themselves in
financial trouble and the properties will have
to be taken over by the government. True,
there is a demand for houses, but I think that
demand has been considerably misunderstood.
The government is taking less risk by
assisting the building of houses for rent
than of houses for sale. A house that could
be bought ten years ago for $4,500 or $5,000
now costs $10,000, or just about double. The
value of a house might drop to a point where
the government's equity would disappear.
The people who need help are those
interested in a rental proposition. I believe
that for them houses could be built, which,
though perhaps not as fancy as those for
prospective purchasers, would be four-square
and warm, have electricity and plumbingHon. Mr. Aseltine: And a basement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and would serve a great
need. There is a crying need for rental housing. The fact that some people are unable
to buy houses may be their own fault, or it
may be the fault of our society, but there
should be a minimum standard of accommodation provided for them. I am very
pleased to see that the bill to some extent
provides for this class of people. I hope that
every province in Canada will accept the
challenge and co-operate in the scheme. I
do not believe that the province of Quebec
will oppose it; I do not know about Alberta,

because it is now so rich that it does not
need much help. But if the provinces are
really interested in the needs of their citizens,
they will get behind the plan and make it
work.
Like the members of another place, I am
not voting against the bill, but I hope that
great care will be exercised in the lending
of money to purchasers who are able to make
only a very small down payment. I am quite
willing that the bill should be referred to
committee, though I see no real necessity
for it. The persons who would appear before
the committee can tell us what is being done,
but they cannot predict the events of the
future. If the government wants the bill
passed, I am prepared to vote for it. I hope
that some action will be taken to promote the
building of houses on a rental basis.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: In connection with his
emphasis on the rental field, I may say to my
honourable friend that there is nothing in
this bill which precludes that field from the
same opportunities for development as previously existed. The co-operation proposed
between the dominion and provinces in
exploring the possibilities of building on new
areas, which will have to be serviced, provides an opportunity for rental projects in
the same way as it does for home ownership
projects. What proportion will be in the
rental field and what in the home ownership
field will depend upon the action taken by
provincial agencies in conjunction with the
federal authorities. The explanatory note to
clause 9 of the bill indicates that we are to
have a more intimate contact between the
people and the government agencies which
are attempting to provide accommodation
for them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so, but I repeat
that because the personnel of the housing
organization have been trained for the last
six or seven years to provide homes for prospective purchasers, I fear the government
will not be anxious to go into the rental field.
The government may hope that the fellow
who buys a house will be able to pay for it;
but the people with the greater need are
those who require rental accommodation.
This need can be met only by the government
putting its shoulder to the wheel and getting
some action. Building for rental purposes
requires a close consideration of suitable
locations, and special attention to the proximity of schools and employment. It may be
all right for certain people to choose a location which suits them and to build on it, but
the fellow who rents, should be so located
that when he moves the property will be
acceptable to someone else.

Hon. Mr. Haig: After a period of two years.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: There is such a provision in most mortgages.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Have many of the borrowers been doing that?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think many
have. As a matter of fact, the experience of
the corporation to date has been very good
on the question of finances; but I think it only
fair to make the point quite clear that the
whole enterprise bas not been conducted on
the

saie

basis

as a

society would conduct its affairs. The scheme
has been developed for the purpose of meeting a social need.
The question now is whether the people
will be as enthusiastie about the proposals
when they consider the cost. It is only fair
to say, however, that public opinion in this
country definitely favours such an experiment as we have had for the past 5 years in
the field of housing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Did I understand the
member from Ottawa to say that only twentysix houses had been built last year within
t
the municipali y of Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That was the figure
given to me for the bouses built within what
we call Toronto proper, not greater Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not metropolitan
Toronto, but municipal Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has the honourable
senator the figure for building construction in
what I might call political or economic
Toronto?

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Quite a number.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
also said that there was great difficulty in
providing services for the new houses, such
as sewers, sidewalk and that sort of thing.
That is of course the case because the system
makes the territory a very extensive one.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) mentioned the price of $250 an
acre for land. That may be the price of farm
land far from the city of Toronto, but within
the range of the city the owners of potential
building lands have advanced their prices.
They are able to do so because of the uneconomical tax system of our municipalities.
I learned with considerable regret that
when the division of the fields of taxation
was being discussed in one of the conferences
between the dominion and the provinces, the
dominion gave to the provinces some undertaking that it would not invade the field of
direct taxation upon land values. That was
a bad undertaking in view of the fact that te
dominion is assuming responsibility for the
building of houses and is leaving to the
provinces and the municipalities all the
arrangements to be made between the public
and the people who own the land upon which
houses will be built.

I suppose the real problem is how to provide the facilities to which my friend refers.
But do not overlook the obstruction in the
way of the building of homes which is
caused by the unrestricted price that the
land-owner may demand from industry. The
price of building lots in all our large cities,
in Toronto, has been skyparticularly
rocketing, so that the man who wants to
build a house is milked of a large sum before

he is allowed to start building: and after that,
of course, he has to meet all the other practical difficulties. At least one great factor in
the solution of the housing problem lies in
municipal taxation. We could open the way
for the building of houses in much greater
numbers by the sane application of the tax
burden upon land values rather than by the

DECEMBER 1. 1949
imposition of sales taxes, tariff charges, and
other imposts which increase the cost of
building material.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Robertson: It has occurred to me

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The leader of the

Hon. Mr. Haig: Speaking only for myself,
I can see no object in sending the bill to committee, though if anybody wants it to go
there I shall not object.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With unanimous consent we could proceed to the third reading.

LUMBER INDUSTRY OF THE MARITIMES

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

That he will call the attention of the Senate to
the condition of the lumber industry in the Maritime Provinces and will inquire of the government
if they are aware that a recent inquiry from the
United Kingdom for 50,000 standards is restricted to
offers from producers in Western Canada and the
northwestern United States.

He said: Honourable senators, I do not
intend to detain the house at any length, but
I feel that I would be derelict in my duty as
a representative of the Maritime Provinces,

DECEMBER 2, 1949
and particularly of the province of New
Brunswick, if I did not again call the attention of the house to the present unhappy
situation as regards the paralysis of the
lumber industry in the Maritime Provinces.
Lumbering is an ancient industry of the
Maritimes; it stems from the earliest days of
Canadian history. From as long ago as 1760,
when every white pine big enough to make
a mast or a spar or a yard for His Majesty's
Navy was stripped from that country and
taken to the United Kingdom, that industry
has been one of the strands of the bonds which
have held together what we previously knew
as the British Empire and what is today the
British Commonwealth of Nations. In recent
years, since 1940, upwards of 200 million
superficial feet of eastern spruce lumber have
been shipped across the Atlantic annually.
This year, on account of the dollar situation,
our lumber industry is practically idle.
I want to impress all honourable senators
with the gravity of this state of affairs. I tell
the house-and from his experience in his
own district the honourable senator from
Royal (Hon. Mr. Jones) will endorse my statement-that men are idle today, and that
because of this condition and the present
high costs of living, the people of the Maritimes are enjoying neither "freedom from
want" nor "freedom from fear". This situation affects not only the lumber industry,
but every class of society in New Brunswick.
The problem was pretty well described in a
conversation which I had recently with a
man in my constituency whose life has been
spent in the woods and who has a large
family, and today is idle and worried. He
said to me: "You tell me that we can't continue our industry because of the foreign
exchange
problem. I don't understand
exchange and currency questions; I have to
rely on what I read in the newspapers and
what I am told, and the more I read the
less I know. But one thing I do know is that
if war broke out tomorrow the foreign
exchange problem would disappear and there
would be plenty of currency with which to
carry on business." It seems a sad commentary on our present-day civilization that,
though we can invent and build planes to
eliminate distance, and bombs capable, perhaps, of destroying human society, yet with
all our wit and ingenuity we have not discovered ways and means by which nations
and peoples can exchange goods and thereby
promote the happiness and prosperity of all.
So I call the attention of the government
to this situation, and ask our leader to
impress upon them the seriousness of our
position. It was bad enough to know that
while we stood idly by, purchases of lumber
45785-25J

were being effected from Russia, Finland,
Czechoslovakia and other European states;
but it was an even more bitter pill we had
to swallow when we learned that inquiries
had been received for 100 million superficial
feet of lumber but that offers were restricted
to producers on our west coast and in the
northwestern United States. Perhaps one of
the greatest crimes with which the people of
the Maritimes can be charged is that in the
past they have perhaps served their King
and country with too much zeal.
This morning I received word from the
United Kingdom that the amount of dollars
which the British authorities will allocate to
Canada for purchases in 1950 has been fixed,
and that the Canadian government is aware
of that amount and of the commodities to
which these dollars are to be allotted. I was
informed that pit-props were definitely not
on the list, but that if Canadians felt that
these or any other commodity should be put
on the list, negotiations could be entered into
for a reduction of quantity of some of the
commodities listed. This information may
or may not be correct, but I should like to
ask the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who is just as conversant with
the situation as I am, to pass this information
on to the government. If it is found to be
correct, he could possibly ask the government to arrange something in the way of sales
of pit-props to the United Kingdom.
The amount spent on pit-props in the whole
of the Maritime Provinces last year was only
$7,300,000, and the amount spent on eastern
Canadian lumber was only $11 million. These
figures are small compared with the total
amount of British purchases in Canada, but
honourable senators will realize just how
much they mean to the good and loyal citizens
of that very important part of Canada, the
Maritime Provinces.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, my honourable friend from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) has inquired
whether the government is aware that a
recent inquiry from the United Kingdom for
50,000 standards is restricted to offers from
producers in Western Canada and the northwestern United States. I could answer this
inquiry by saying that the government is
aware of this situation, but I should not like
to be so brief, because the question is an
important one to the economy of the Maritime Provinces. I should prefer to reply at
greater length and explain the situation, but

SENATE
I am not prepared to do so this afternoon.
I therefore move the adjournment of the
debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 185, an Act to amend
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, I had toyed
with the idea of asking the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) to explain this bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: But, thinking that
would possibly handicap him in certain comments that he might wish to make on the
bill, I decided to explain it myself.

The Prairie Farm Assistance Act was placed
on the Statute Books of Canada in June
1939, as a result of the many difficulties and
problems which had arisen in Western
Canada, and more particularly in certain
areas, by reason of general crop losses. These
losses were caused by drought, grasshoppers,
sawflies, cutworms, flooding, hail, frost, and
so on. They had placed upon many rural
municipalities and the provincial governments the obligation of providing direct relief
and agricultural assistance to those who had
suffered repeated crop losses, a financial
obligation which became not only difficult
but quite impossible for the municipalities
and provinces to sustain. To meet the situation thus created, calls for assistance were
made upon the federal government by the
provinces, and consequently a system of
direct agricultural relief was developed.
The Right Honourable J. G. Gardiner,
Minister of Agriculture, made a study of the
situation with a view to evolving some plan
which would in the main remove this burden
of relief from the municipalities and provincial governments in years when there was
a widespread crop failure. The result was
the passing of this Act, which first became
operative in time for the crop year beginning
August 1, 1939.
From 1939 to the end of the crop year in
1948, payments totalling almost $104 million
were made to farmers. Of this sum about
$34 million was contributed by the farmers
themselves. The contribution is made by
way of a one per cent levy which is deducted
from the sale price of all wheat, oats, rye
and barley sold to or through licensed grain
dealers and the elevators. This levy is
collected by the dealers, who transfer it to
the Board of Grain Commissioners of Canada,
and it is then deposited in the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. This means that about $3
was paid out by the Government of Canada
for every dollar collected, and that the
difference of $2 was paid by the taxpayers
of the whole country.
At the present time awards paid to farmers
are in two categories and, are made on half
of the cultivated acreage only, up to, but
not exceeding, 400 acres; in other words, the
maximum cultivated acreage for pay is 200
acres. When the average yield in an area
is from 0 to 4 bushels per acre, a farmer
in that area receives $2.50 per acre on
one-half of his cultivated acreage. When it
is 4 to 8 bushels, the payment is $1.50.
The awards are payable in two instalments:
60 per cent in December, and 40 per cent in
March of the following year.
Now I come to the proposed amendments.
When the Act was first passed, a crop failure
year, or emergency year, had to be declared

DECEMBER 2. 1949
by the Governor in Council. However, as a
result of an amendment made in 1947,
this is no longer necessary, nor is it
necessary to have a stated number of townships where the yield is from 0 to 4 bushels
before payment can be made. Any township with a yield of less than 8 bushels of
wheat per acre can qualify. This amendment of 1947 also brought into payment,
areas that were outside an eligible township
but contiguous to it; at the same time it took
out of payment, areas in an eligible township
where there was some crop. It has been
considered for some time, however, that the
Act did not go far enough in bringing areas
into payment, and after careful study it was
deemed that the amendments in this bill
would be an improvement in making awards
to those who have suffered crop losses.
Under the present Act a rectangular block
of 9 sections of land is taken out of payment
in an eligible township when contiguous to
one that is ineligible and when the average
yield in that block is 14 or more bushels to
the acre. The proposed new section 7(a) of
the Act will reduce the area taken out of
payment in an eligible township when contiguous to one that is ineligible, from a rectangular block of 9 sections having an
average yield of 14 bushels, to one of 6
sections having an average yield of more than
10 bushels.
The new section 7 (b) brings into payment
smaller areas than heretofore which are outside but contiguous to an eligible township.
It reduces the size of such areas from a
9-section rectangular block to a sixth of a
township-which I presume is six sectionsand the average yield from 10 bushels to 8
bushels or less.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are 36 sections in a
township.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, but this reduces
the size of the area from a 9-section rectangular block to one-sixth of a township, and
I added that I thought that meant 6 sections.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The most important
amendment is the proposed section 7(c). This
is something new, and the effect will be to
bring into payment any half-township outside areas already established on a legal
township basis, but it need not be contiguous
to them. It will have the effect of reducng
the unit in areas declared eligible for award
from a township to any rectangular area consisting of no less than 18 sections, or half a
township, provided, of course, that such an
area has already been established elsewhere
on a township basis. For all practical purposes, therefore, it will reduce the unit to

half a township, for experience shows that
there has never been a year without at least
an area of one township with a crop failure.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I am sure we all appreciate the explanation
just given to us by the honourable leader.
The Prairie Farm Assistance Act has been
before us for améndment almost every year
since 1939, and I think we are gradually
improving it. I am strongly in favor of the
amendments proposed in the present bill.
The Prairie Provinces-Manitoba on the East,
Saskatchewan in the centre and Alberta on
the West- extend over a very wide area,
and while any one of these provinces may
have a big crop, but there may be areas
within those provinces where, because of
the lack of rain, there is no crop at all; therefore some relief such as is provided by this
Act is absolutely necessary.
As has been explained, a township is an
area six miles square, and comprises 36 sections of land. A section is a mile square and
contains four quarter sections. When the
bill refers to a strip of land six sections
long, it could mean the whole side of a
township. The amendment changing the wording from nine sections to six is a considerable
improvement. It is also an improvement to
consider a half township instead of the whole,
as there are many townships which have
suffered crop failure only in certain parts.
When I spoke on this subject the last time
it was before the house, I said that I was
very much in favour of the Act and always
had been, but that there was one feature of
it with which I did not agree. I have in mind
cases where the crop production has been
such as to qualify certain areas for payment
under the Act, as was mentioned by the
honourable leader of the government. But
in some of those areas there may be a farmer
who has 20, 30, or even 40 bushels per acre
-which in no case could be considered a crop
failure-and yet he collects in the same way
as do the other farmers. I have in mind the
case of a farmer who, although he paid
income tax of more than $5,000 for the year,
was obliged to accept a payment of $1.50 an
acre for 200 acres of his cultivated land. In
other words, he collected $300 under this
Act, and paid income tax on that amount.
I think the Act should be further amended
to except such farmers. A farmer who has
a crop of the kind I have mentioned should
receive no assistance.
There has been some confusion about just
how a crop failure in any township is arrived
at. I shall try to clear up that point. The
yield of wheat is only used to ascertain
whether the area is dry enough to entitle the
farmers in it to receive payment under the

SENATE
Act. For example, I may be a livestock
farmer and grow no wheat at all; but if the
yield of wheat in my township or in the area
surrounding my farm is four bushels or less
per acre, I receive $2.50 an acre for 200 acres
of my land just as if I was a wheat grower.
Do I make myself clear?
Some Hon. Senators: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Leger: That is a very strange
situation.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The farmer bas to buy
feed for his cattle.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If the township is so
dry that the wheat farmers have four bushels
or less to the acre, the law says that other
farmers in the area, whether grain producers
or not, are entitled to the same relief.
Hon. Mr. Leger: If a man is not a farmer
at all, is he entitled to relief?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He has to be a farmer.
Hon. Mr. Leger: He may just live in a
farming district.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I live in a farming district, but not on a f arm.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I still maintain that my
friend is an agriculturist.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My friend from Winnipeg applies the same appellation to me as
he did to another friend of mine not long
ago. Perhaps I am one of those so-called
agriculturists who make their money in town
and spend it on the farm. The farmer makes
his money on the farm and spends it in the
town.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask my honourable friend a question? I understand that
under the Act the people who grow wheat,
oats, barley and rye pay one per cent of the
sale price of their grain in order to carry
the cost of operations under this Act, and the
treasury puts up the difference between the
and the amount
farmer's contribution
required.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Does my friend mean
to tell me that we farmers in Manitoba who
never have a crop failureHon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: -have to pay taxes so
that a man who does not grow any of the
grain I mention may receive certain
payments?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is right. Through
this one per cent tax on the sale of wheat,
oats, barley, and other grains, Manitoba has

always paid more than the farmers in that
province were entitled to receive by reason
of crop failure.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: We in Manitoba get
gypped all the time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: But the farmers of
Manitoba forget that they pay a great deal
less for freight by reason of being near the
head of the lakes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Their freight rate is
8 per cent less than we pay from Saskatchewan; therefore they should pay more under
this Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But we pay the same
elevator charges as you do.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Then you had better keep
quiet.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Perhaps I could convince my friend from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) if I gave him a summary of part
of the remarks of the Minister of Agriculture
in another place. He said, in effect: We do
not make payments to anyone because of the
small or large amount of wheat he may produce on an acre of land. The Act simply
says that the yield of wheat in a township
is used for the purpose of determining
whether that area bas been dry or not. We
do not make payments on the basis of the
amount of wheat. A man does not need to
grow any grain at all in order to qualify for
payment; he may have nothing but grass
land, with live stock running on it, and still
be entitled to receive his payments under
this Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Provided he has a certain amount of land under cultivation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The minister does not
say that.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Will the honourable
senator tell me what the river farmers do
about their crops?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They pay their share.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you mean, what do
they pay?
Hon. Mr. Howden: No: how is it estimated?
The river farms are not divided up into
townships.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not in a position
to give information with regard to that. Perhaps the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who sponsors this bill, can do so.
In Saskatchewan and other parts of the
West they do things on the square, not in
such a longitudinal manner.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Sometimes you do;
sometimes you don't.

DECEMBER 2, 1949
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if ten bushels to the acre is not
the basic yield?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Eight bushels.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It says here ten bushels;
ten or less, or eight or less?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is eight or less now.
To qualify for the payment of $1.50 on the
two hundred acres your crop must be eight
bushels or less. To qualify for $2.50 per acre
on two hundred acres the yield in the township must be four bushels an acre or less.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If the farmer has a
crop of eight bushels to the acre he qualifies
for the benefit; but is there any offset of the
amount that he might salvage from the eightbushel-per-acre crop?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: He is entitled to the full
payment. On more than one occasion I have
advocated that qualification for payment
should be reckoned on an individual basis. I
am not so sure now that I was right in taking
that position. The present bill goes about as
far as could be expected. I should like to
see it amended so that a f armer residing in a
township where the low yield entitles producers to this payment would be disqualified
from such benefits if his crop happened to be
fourteen or fifteen or twenty bushels to the
acre.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There should be a sliding scale in the application of these benefits.
For instance, if a man has eight bushels of
wheat to the acre, at $2 per bushel he is
receiving $16 per acre.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not know that anybody is getting $2 a bushel for wheat.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, at Fort William.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: At Rosetown we get
$1.56k per bushel for No. 1 wheat.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: And something more
later.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But the total will not
amount to $2; there are handling charges and
other expenses, including the cost of running
the Wheat Board. If the scope of this
measure should be extended to embrace individual areas and enable the individual
farmer to participate, no matter what area he
is in, the provinces should be required to pay
a share of the cost. At the present time the
provinces contribute nothing; the farmers
are charged 1 per cent, deducted at the
source; the federal government pays whatever balance is required. I believe that
$17 million is the estimate of the amount to
be disbursed this year. Of this sum, twothirds will be paid by the taxpayers and
one-third will be collectqd from the farmers.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is the charge for
this year.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, for 1949. It will be
noticed that clause 2 provides:
This Act shail be deemed to have come into force
on the first day of August, nineteen hundred and
forty-nine.

That is, the beginning of the new crop year.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not wish to divert
the honourable member from his statement;
but the figure of $17 million presented as the
total estimate coincides exactly, I believe,
with the amount which is being contributed
by the government this year to subsidize the
shipment of feed grains from Western to
Eastern Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What the honourable
senator means is that the farmers in the East,
as well as the farmers in the West, are being
taken care of.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is what I wanted
to bring out.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am glad that the
honourable senator mentioned that point. I
should like to ask the leader of the government to furnish -information to this chamber,
or to the committee if this bill goes to committee, showing by provinces how much
money has been paid to farmers of the
Prairie Provinces pursuant to the Prairie
Farmers Assistance Act, 1939, during the
period the Act has been in operation. The
statement to include disbursements in the
present year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You will find that
Manitoba's share is small.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I believe that this year
Manitoba had one of the largest crops in its
history, and that few if any areas will need
this assistance. I understand, however, that
the honourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden) did not have any crop
on his farnm; and I sincerely hope that he will
get his $300.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Could the honourable
senator make even a rough guess of the
amount of acreage affected through having
less than eight bushels?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would have to do a
problem in arithmetic.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will arrange to have
before the committee someone who probably
can answer the honourable senator's question.
Hon. Mr. Howden: I should like to pursue
my interrogation a little further. It will not
be news to honourable senators that in
Manitoba a large amount of land is divided
according to what is known as the river farm

SENATE

system. The width of a lot is five chains, or
330 feet; its inner length may extend two
miles, and the outer length two miles, making
four miles of land only 330 feet wide. This
was the original division of a river farm in

the Red River and Assiniboia valleys. I have
never heard any mention of the manner in
which these farm lots were considered in
relation to the Prairie Farm Assistance Act.
Like my friend from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), I own one of these farms, and I
am curious enough to ask what provision has
been made for them under this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I can give my honourable friend some information. It happenedin which year I have forgotten-that parts
of the Red River lots were drowned out, and
parts were hailed out. The damaged areas
were inspected by officials employed under
this Act, and a block of these lots was held
entitled to compensation, and the farmers
received the money. It was necessary, I
understand, to provide for the payments, by
order in council because the Act as it stood
did not contemplate provision for an area of
this kind. I think there is now in the act, a
section which would take care of this situation.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: I do not want to

prolong this discussion, and I am not rising
to oppose this measure. In fact, because I
am familiar with conditions which exist in
the areas to be benefited by this bill, I am
in favour of it. I do, however, want to offer
some constructive suggestions in the hope
that the day will arrive-I do not look for
it in my lifetime-when the greater use of
irrigation throughout western Canada will
overcome the necessity for measures of this
kind. I remember how much my honourable
friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) was
impressed when he visited southern Alberta
in 1919, one of the driest years in western
Canada, particularly in Alberta. He travelled
across many miles of almost complete desert
land before coming upon an irrigated section
which was producing many varieties of crops.
The areas benefiting from irrigation do not
require assistance from this Act. In past years
certain areas close to my home city had to
appeal for help because in some seasons they
were drifted out and in others they were
dried out. Today, because the land bas been
irrigated, these same areas are producing
immense wealth. They are producing sugar
beets and vegetables for the local canneries,
and are also providing feed for livestock. The
transformation of dry to irrigated land will
take place slowly, but eventually the need
for assistance of the kind provided under
this bill will be unnecessary.

At times one hears complaints that too
much money is being spent to help the
farmers of Western Canada because of the
misfortunes they face. It is true that vast
sums are spent for this purpose, but I do
not want anyone to believe that the farmers
are responsible for this situation. If the
blame can rest anywhere, it must be with the
governments who were in power during the
days when these lands were first settled. The
pioneer settlers were told that these were
good farmlands, and they were encouraged
to settle there. It is true that they had wonderful crops some years, but they certainly
had their bad times. For instance, I recall
that when I was a member of another place
I received appeals for help from the people
of southeastern Alberta. This was in the
years 1911-12-13, one of the worst dry periods
in the history of Western Canada.

Then, in

1914-15, a year or so later, I received appeals
for aid in the transport of grain from that
country, because there was insufficient elevator accommodation there to handle the grain.
Tremendous wealth produced in two or three
years will offset the losses incurred in other
years; there will be both good and bad crop
years, and this uncertain situation will
continue.
One often hears the comment that our
farmers should be removed from these particularly bad dry areas. But where could
they go? I remember that a number of Saskatchewan farmers moved into an irrigated
district south of Brooks, where after a few
years of residence they became prosperous.
But irrigation has not spread sufficiently to
enable the re-settling of large numbers of
farmers from dry areas. It must also be borne
in mind that modern agricultural communities, such as Swift Current, Saskatchewan,
have been brought into existence: some years
they have rich crops and other years they
have lean crops; but once the people move
from the land and it is non-productive for
several years, the community is destroyed.
Honourable senators, my thought is that
wherever possible irrigation should be put
into these dry areas, not only to make the
country more productive but to protect the
investments of the people who settled there.
It is a slow process indeed to irrigate the land,
but eventually irrigation will solve this problem of assistance to farmers in dry areas. The
areas I mentioned earlier are today producing
great wealth. It may have cost a lot to
establish these irrigation systems, but as the
years go by the return will be greater than
would otherwise have been possible.
While I do not object to the measure before
us, I am hopeful that the time will come when
parliament will not have to give this type of

DECEMBER 2, 1949
assistance, but will provide funds for irrigation wherever it is needed on the plains of
Western Canada.
Hon. IR. B. Harner: Honourable senators,
I amn in favour with this bill and its amendments because the benefits go to the man who
is actually on the land. My bonourable friend
fromn Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), like those
persons mentioned by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), is an agriculturist who owns land and rents it; but this
legisiation will only benefit the man who
works the land.
When the Prairie Farma Assistance Act was
first adopted it was hoped that the one per
cent levy on the sale of ail grains would pay
the entire cost; that it would create a suffidient fund to take care o! ahl losses in the
future. The damage this year has been quite
extensive, and the one per cent is not enough
to cover the losses. 1 can understand why it
is the wish of some farmers that this measure
be narrowed down to apply ta individual
farms, but honourable senators will realîze
the impossibility of such a systemn, for in a
community there might be one farmer who
would persist in seeding bis land with a
second, third and f ourth crop, putting it in at
littie expense, in the hope of getting the whole
bonus.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: He would be dishonest.
Hon. Mr. Hlorner: There are only very f ew
of these people, but I do recali one man telling
me ail about tbe seeding he had done-and
he wanted me to get the governrnent ta apply
the bonus to the individual farmer.
I may say that there are a great many river
lots in northern and southern Saskatchewan,
and this fact was one of the causes contributing to the Riel Rebellion. The people who
settled there were determined to keep their
land in lots leading down to the river, but the
surveyors had other ideas. The resulting
quarrel. was one a! the main causes of the
rebellian.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I arn quite willing that
the bill should go to comrnittee, if honourable
senators so require. Otherwise I move the
third reading.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not necessary to send
this bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: The information I asked
for is not important enough to warrant a delay
in passing the bill. I simply wanted to be
informed as to the exact distribution of the
45785-26

money in the three Prairie Provinces over the
years, but I can get that information at
another time.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I sympathize, as 1 arn
sure senators fromn Saskatchewan do, with the
people of Manitoba wbo have *had such
bountiful crops that they have paîd levies and
have not been able to collect anything in
return.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We envy them.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: They are something
like the man who bas been paying fire insurance premiums for a long term o! years and
bas neyer been fortunate enougb to have
a fire. Perhaps the senators fromn Manitoba
would like to get together and pray for a crop
failure.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Notbing doing!
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The point I wanted to
have cleared up was whether I arn taxed
on the sale o! my cereals to pay a farmer
in any dried-out area wbo does not grow any
cereals at ail.
Hon. Mr. Ross: If he does not grow any
cereals be is not a farmer, but a rancher.
And the ranchers as well as the farmers wilI
suifer from dry weather.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Let the ranchers be
taxed, then.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators,
I withdraw my question about the acreage,
if it would delay passage of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
JUDGES

BILL

SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 65. an Act to amend the
Judges Act, 1946.-Hon. Mr. Robertson.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honaurable senators,
1 have asked the honourable gentleman from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) to handie this bill.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill and it is not my intention ta make
any lengthy rernarks with respect to it. It
fahlows more or less naturally on an amendment tbat we made earlier this session to the
Supreme Court Act, whereby the number af
judges o! the Supreme Court o! Canada was
increased by two and the Court was made the
final court of appeal for this country.
In keeping with the importance o! aur final
court a! appeal, it is desirable that the persons
appointed as Judges in future shahl be, like

SENATE
the present members of the Court, of the
highest professional status and attainments,
eminent at the Bar of the provinces in which
they respectively have practised. When
lawyers of this class accept appointment to
the Supreme Court Bench they necessarily
make some financial sacrifice. Besides, they
must give up their business interests and
sever social and family ties in their own
communities, for they are required to live
at Ottawa.
The first section of the bill provides for an
increase in the salary of the Chief Justice
of Canada from $20,000 to $25,000 per annum,
and for an increase in the salaries of the
puisne judges, from $16,000 to $20,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable gentleman permit a question? What pension is payable to these judges when they reach the
age of 75?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I am not sure, but I think
the pension is the same as the full salary.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is three-quarters of the
salary, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I believe it is twothirds.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I also ask a question? How do these proposed salaries compare
with the salaries of judges doing similar work
in Great Britain and in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: My recollection is that the
judges of the Privy Council are paid £5,000
per annum. The Associate Judges of the
United States Supreme Court are paid, I
believe, $25,000, but the salary of the Chief
Justice is more than that. That court would
be comparable to our Supreme Court.
The second section implements recent
Ontario legislation which increased the number of Justices of Appeal in that province
from seven to nine and the number of Judges
of the High Court from fourteen to sixteen.
The section provides for their salaries on the
same basis as the salaries of the present
members of the Ontario court, $12,000.
The third and last section of the bill has
application only to the province of New
Brunswick. At present the Judges Act provides for travelling allowances for a judge
who resides at the city of Moncton, but provincial legislation bas recently been amended
to authorize the residence of two judges in
that city. This amendment will make possible the payment of travelling allowances to
two judges who live in Moncton or in the
immediate vicinity and are required to hold
court from time to time at other cities in the
province as well.
I do not think any further explanation of
the bill is necessary.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Can the honourable
gentleman tell me why the designations of
judges in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
are different from those in other provinces'
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I should say that the designations in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
are the same as those that existed prior to
After 1867 the provincial
confederation.
courts continued to function as they had
before, and they carried with them their
old names. If there has been any change in
designation since then, it has been brought
about by the provinces themselves, for the
constitution of the courts is a matter within
provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I do not suppose that anything I have to say
will affect the bill at all, but I am one of the
few who is a little uneasy at seeing an
increase in judges' salaries at this time. I
know we all have to live, but I think every
honourable senator will agree with me when
I say that there has never been any difficulty
in finding competent men to accept judgeships
as vacancies occur, and there is always a lot
of wire-pulling before the vacancies are
filled. Certain individuals are always willing
to give service to their country for the high
honour that comes to them from this position.
I have in mind the honourable Prime
Minister of this country, who could fill the
office of a judge with distinction, but is
performing a greater function at a total cost
to the country of $18,000 a year.
I think we should be very careful about
increasing salaries, as we propose to do at
this time, especially when we appear to be
headed towards considerable unemployment.
Many of us have served the country in such
a capacity as member of a school board, for
I do not
instance, without remuneration.
suggest that judges should serve without
pay, but I view with some alarm a salary
increase of as much as $5,000, as proposed
by this bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,

I do not intend to try to answer anybody's
questions on this subject, but I think we
should consider the proposals contained in
this bill in the light of what judges received
up to about 1940. At that time the Chief
Justice of a superior court of a province
received about $10,000 a year, and the puisne
judges got approximately $9,000. The Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada
received, I think, $15,000 and the puisne
judges $12,000. Those were considered low
salaries.
As a practising lawyer I say candidly that
when one goes before a good judge he is sure
of a fair hearing and a sound judgment. I

SENATE

Several men of this type are on the bench in
Manitoba and, I presume, elsewhere in
Canada.
I am in favour of the increase. I know it
is considerable. I know too whoever is chosen
for a judicial appointment, that it will be
said that some other lawyer just as good could
have been found. Of course there could
have been, but all lawyers cannot be judges.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien:

What will be left to

these judges after they have paid their income
tax?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They will not have so very
much. The Chief Justice, with a salary of
$25,000, will pay about $9,000 in income tax.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Which would leave him
about $15,000?
Hon. Mr. Haig: About $16,000. I do not
want to mention the name, but about two
years ago a British Columbia lawyer whose
earnings I have reason to believe, were about
$60,000 a year, was appointed to the bench.
He accepted the appointment because he
wanted to give public service.
Canada should pay her judges good salaries.
The judges are the people chosen to administer justice in this country, and the better men
they are the better the administration will be.
Much of our freedom is based on the judgments of our courts. I have been a member
of the Bar for forty-five years, and I have
never known any member of our high courts
of Manitoba whom I could not trust to the
limit. I have appeared both for plaintiffs and
defendants; I know Winnipeg lawyers, and
their- general feeling is that the courts have
administered even justice, have given fair
play.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: That is true in every
province.
Hon. Mr.

Haig: I have

no doubt it

is.

Unfortunately I know only Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I know Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wanted to make this publie acknowledgment of the service that the
judges are giving to our country.
At one time anxiety was expressed about
the standing of the Supreme Court in another
country. We know that the late President
Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court
at Washington, and that even death helped
him in his designs. But the concern expressed
reflected the feeling in the public mind about
the power of that court. Our court has been
given new powers through the amendment of
the constitution. The responsiblities which
are being added to that Bench will make its
members even better men than they are now.

So, speaking as an individual, not as leader
of the Progressive Conservative party, but
as a lawyer who knows something about the
business with which courts have to deal, I
must say I am very glad the government has
recognized the importance of our judiciary.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I agree pretty well with
everything my leader has stated. There is
however, one matter to which I think attention should be given. Al over Canada a great
deal of confusion is evident with regard to
this name "Supreme Court". We have a
Supreme Court of Alberta, a Supreme Court
in other provinces, a Supreme Court of
Canada. The names of courts in the provinces
which use this term should be changed.
There should be only one Supreme Court, so
that when a layman hears "Supreme Court"
mentioned he will know that it is the Supreme
Court of Canada that is referred to-the
highest court in the land.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Is not the highest court
in Manitoba called the Court of Appeal?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is a Court of Appeal
and a Court of King's Bench. In Manitoba
the term "Supreme Court" is not used.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Saskatchewan has a
Court of King's Bench and a Court of Appeal,
but there is a Supreme Court not only in
Alberta but in British Columbia and Nova
Scotia as well. I think something should be
done so that the ordinary man on the street
may know what is being referred to when we
talk about the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. Leger: We in the Maritimes speak
of the "Supreme Court of New Brunswick"
and the "Supreme Court of Canada", so there
is no confusion.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Speaking not as a lawyer,
but as a layman who, I hope, will never
appear before any judge, I am inclined to
agree with the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I would be
opposed to an increase of salaries unless there
is difficulty in obtaining judges. A few years
ago, as I sat here and listened to expressions
of sympathy with school teachers because of
the small pay they were receiving, my mind
went back to the teacher who first taught me,
and who received a stipend of $14 a month.
I reflected that if she had been getting a
million dollars a year she could not have
done any more than she did.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: She did a good job on you.

Hon. Mr. Horner: She did the best job she
could. It is true of every individual, no matter what his occupation, that if he is not
naturally fitted for the work he is doing, the
salary won't make him better. The money

be a love of or aptitude for the particular job.
Often it is true that the more you pay the
less you get.

He said: Those who were in the house in

Hon. Mr. Haig: And was passed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And was passed, but
it fell by the wayside because of the early
dissolution. It has come up again this year,
having been started in the House of Commons, but since it contains two or three provisions which were not in the previous bill,
and for the benefit of honourable senators
who were not here earlier in the year, I propose to make a brief explanation of the
measure as it originally stood and of the
additions which have since been made.
The Industrial Development Bank Act was
passed by parliament in 1944. The objective
of the Act is to assist business enterprises of
a certain nature which cannot secure from
ordinary sources the capital necessary for the
commencement or expansion of operations.
Even though these enterprises haVe a very
reasonable expectation of success, they very
often cannot obtain necessary capital at
reasonable rates or on reasonable terms.
Chartered banks are not allowed to advance
money for such expansion. Because of this,
the Industrial Development Bank is in no way
in competition with them. Other institutions
which might lend money to such enterprises
find it necessary to charge such rates and
impose such terms as make it impossible for
the enterprises to borrow the money. The
Industrial Development Bank, therefore, functions in a field that has never before been
occupied by any lending institution. The
number of loans made, and the success of the
businesses involved, are ample proof of the
need for such services.

Up to September 30, 1949, the bank had
dealt with 1,960 applications for financial
assistance. Of these, 613 were withdrawn
because the applicant got credit elsewhere,
or for other reasons, and 657 were refused
as being unjustifiable risks. Six hundred
and ninety loans were authorized, for a total
amount of $46,341,210. Of these loans, 437
were still on the books of the bank on
September 30 last. The total portion of these
loans remaining unpaid is $23,573,729; the
bad debts on them have been very small,
amounting to only $34,340 as of September 30,
1949.
The Industrial Development Bank was set
up as a subsidiary of the Bank of Canada,
its share capital being authorized at $25
million. The bank is permitted to issue
debentures, not guaranteed by the government, to a maximum of three times its
capital and reserve, but none of these debentures have yet been issued.
Of the total credit of at least $100 million
that is available to the bank for loans, only
$15 million can be applied to loans exceeding
$200,000. This limitation is set out in subsection 2 of section 15 of the present Act.
It was originally thought that the bank would
limit its loans to enterprises that required
$200,000 or less for capital expansion. This
worked out satisfactorlly for a time, but the
price of capital goods and capital construction has increased materially since the Act
was passed. The bank has found recently
that its requests for loans in excess of
$200,000 have shown a sharp rise, the greater
part of this increased demand for higher
loans being caused by the higher price of
capital goods and construction, to which I
have already referred. In 1944 these enterprises could have carried out their capital
needs on less than $200,000, but now they
require more. For this reason the bank
is seeking an increase in the amount of
money that it can apply to loans of over
$200,000, and it proposes that the amount be
increased from $15 million to $25 million.
This increase would not affect loans of less
than $200,000, because at least $75 million
would be available for this purpose.
As I mentioned at the beginning, this
amendment was passed by the Senate last
session. It was discussed at considerable
length on second reading, and was referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where Mr. Towers and other appropriate officers appeared and gave evidence.
I believe that the majority of members at
that time were well satisfied with the
information obtained.

SENATE
The bill now before us proposes three
amendments that did not come before the
house last session. The first of these is
purely procedural in nature. Some confusion
has existed as to whether actions for and
against the bank should be taken in its name
or in the name of His Majesty. Therefore, it
proposes to resolve this difficulty. Section 1
of the bill provides that such actions may be
taken in the name of the bank.
Section 2 of the bill, in addition to increasing the amount available for loans exceeding
$200,000, embodies two other amendments.
Up to the present time a person applying for
a loan has had to establish objectively that
he was in or was about to be engaged in an
industrial enterprise as described in the Act,
and a court was the only body which could
finally decide this question. The amendment would permit the bank to make a loan
available if the applicant, in the opinion of
the Board of Directors, was in or about to
be engaged in an industrial enterprise. The
other amendment contained in this section
would permit the bank to loan money even
if another party has loaned or is about to
loan money to the same enterprise, provided
that the bank can assure itself that its loan
has priority over such other loan.
Section 3 of the bill clarifies the Act as
it applies to the province of Quebec. It
states definitely that the bank may hold
hypothecated property, which is peculiar to
that province.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Is any Canadian citizen
eligible for a loan from this Industrial
Development Bank?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Oh, no.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to delay this bill, but I should
like to ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) two questions that come to mind.
I well remember that when the bill came
before another place assurance was given
that great encouragement would be given to
small industries starting up, and also that
there would be no sectionalism in the providing of loans. What is the smallest loan
that has been made by the bank? It would
be interesting to know, too, just where the
loans, generally speaking, have been located.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not in a position
to answer my honourable friend from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), but I am quite
willing to have this information supplied in
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

TEMISCOUATA RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 145, an Act respecting the
acquisition of the Temiscouata Railway.-Hon. Mr.
Robertson.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have asked the
honourable gentleman from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) to handle this bill.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
seeks approval of an agreement entered into
between His Majesty the King and the
Temiscouata Railway for the purchase of
that railway. It also authorizes the Minister
of Finance to pay a sum not exceeding
$480,000 for its purchase. In 1948, it having
become evident that the railway could not
continue operation much longer under existing conditions, the government authorized
the Canadian National Railways to enter into
negotiations for the purchase of the Temiscouata Railway at a price not exceeding half
a million dollars. The owners, represented
by the bondholders in England, called a meeting of the shareholders of the committee, and
the sale of the railway was approved by
that meeting. The Canadian National Railways were successful in negotiating a price
of $480,000, a sum $20,000 less than had
been authorized, and on October 14 this year
the Government of Canada signed a purchase
agreement for the railway at that price.
The Temiscouata Railway was opened for
traffic in 1889 and in 1891 an extension of
the railway was completed. The original

railway and the extension run from Riviere
du Loup to Moncton, New Brunswick and
thence to Connors, New Brunswick. The total
mileage of the railway, including 11-9 miles
of running rights over the Canadian National
from Edmundston to Baker Brook, is 113
miles.
Thus the total mileage owned is
almost exactly 101 miles. The railway also
has sidings and other tracks to a total of 9-3
miles.
The line serves approximately 38,000 people,
17,000 of whom are also served by other
lines. A number of lumber mills are located
along its route. The Fraser Company has
a large mill at Cabano, producing approximately 10 million feet of lumber annually.
The other mills are smaller, but there are
several of them. From Edmundston to Connors
the railway serves a fertile farming area.
Abandonment of operation of the railway
would create serious complications in the
economy of the area served and it is considered essential in the national interest to
keep the railway in operation.
Honourable senators, no doubt, will be
primarily interested in the financial structure
of the Une. It has not got the same
kind of financial structure as the Canadian
Pacific or the Canadian National.
The
authorized capital is $1 million, all of
which bas been issued, although only
one share of $100 bas been paid up. Added
to that is an issue of 5 per cent consolidated
mortgage income bonds, amounting to
£584,948. At the time of issue these bonds
were worth $2,856,336 but at the time of
purchase of the railway they were valued at
$2,362,000.
No dividends have been paid
on the capital stock since issue. Since 1930
interest bas not been paid on the bonds, and
prior to that time it was only partially paid.
The inability of the railway since 1930 to
meet its obligations on capital account, is
well reflected in its annual financial statements. In 1943 its net income was only
$208; in 1945 there was a deficit of $272, and
in 1947 the net income was $1,161. In the
years I have mentioned revenues from the
shipment of forestry products contributed
more than 80 per cent of the receipts of the
company.
The railway bas continued to operate only
because its employees have been willing to
accept subnormal wages.
The average
number of employees in 1948 was 144, with
a total payroll of $258,702. Had the wage rate
of the Canadian National Railways been in
effect, the payroll for that year would have
been $399,490-an increase of $140,000, or 54
per cent.

DECEMBER 5, 1949
In addition to this indirect assistance by
way of low wages, the line has been receiving help from the Canadian National Railways
and the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1948
the Canadian National Railways contributed
$49,125 and the Canadian Pacific Railway
granted $24,275, or a total of $73,400. These
sums were paid for special divisions of
revenue, and for per diem assistance on
equipment.
In 1948 the Temiscouata Railway Company
indicated that at present traffic levels it would
be unable to operate and maintain the line
in a safe condition; that if something were
not done the railway would have to be abandoned and the company realize what salvage
it could.
I would point out that the bondholders are
being paid off at considerably less than 25
per cent of the face value of the bonds, and
that the current assets of the railway exceed
liabilities by more than $137,000. Also the
Canadian National Railways estimate that
the scrap value of the railway is about
$240,000. The total assets therefore amount
to $377,000. It will be seen that the amount
being paid per mile of track is very small
when compared with previous purchases of
this type of railway. Conditions similar to
those existing in the case of the Temiscouata
Railway prompted the government to purchase other lines in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec. The amount paid per mile
for those railways was much in excess of the
amount now being asked.
This is a small railway, but it is necessary
that it be maintained to serve the people in
that area. For the Canadian National Railways it is not a bad venture, because this
railway serves as a connecting link between
two of its lines, and will save many miles in
the transportation of freight between the
Maritimes and Quebec.
The government's policy in enabling this
railway to operate may be compared with the
service given by the Post Office. It is obvious
that the few pieces of mail handled at an
outlying post office, say on the north shore of
Labrador, does not compensate the government for the services it gives. I feel that
if we are to continue the development of our
country from the standpoint of the products
of our farms and forests, it is a good thing
for the Canadian National Railways to take
over this line.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I can appreciate the difficulty the government
faces in connection with this railway. I am
not opposed to the bill, but my hope is that
the Canadian National Railways will not be
charged for this line. The time has come
when we must get the Canadian National

Railways on a proper basis of value, and then
tell the management that its operations must
be made to pay. That railway is now going
behind some $49 million or $59 million a year,
and if we load this "warm baby" on it, it may
show a deficit of as much as $69 million a
year. It is not fair to the management of the
Canadian National Railways to ask them to
assume such a line as we are now considering,
and to tell them to make a success of it.
This is perhaps as good a time as any to
say something about railways generally. Perhaps I will not be thanked for what I am
about to say, but I will say it anyway. I
cannot understand how wages and other costs
of a railway can be increased without raising
rates. I have not been able to get a clear
answer to that problem. I can understand
that the Temiscouata Railway must continue
to operate. There are people and industries
in that area that must be served, but it is
not fair to put this load of $480,000 on the
Canadian National Railways. It is said that
one should not look a gift horse in the mouth;
but I should think that if Donald Gordon, the
new chief of the Canadian National system,
looked this horse in the mouth, and examined
what has happened over the last five years,
he would get quite a shock.
I am one of those who believes that the
sooner we face Canada's railway problem
realistically, the better it will be for everybody. The people of this country must appreciate the cost of railway operation. I have
followed as carefully as I could the investigations which have taken place before the
Board of Railway Commissioners during the
past two and a half years. It shocked me to
hear the people who opposed the railway
rate increases get up and say, "We will take
the Canadian Pacific as a standard upon
which to base the rates, and we will not consider the Canadiar National Railways at all".
Now I see that someone in Alberta, I believe,
has suggested that the government subsidize
the railways so that they may have a balanced
budget. We as Canadians, and especially as
senators, ought to state some plain facts about
the whole railway situation.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are one class of people
who can truly appraise the situation.
I do not suppose any members of this house
are foolish enough to own stock in a railway
company. If they are, they should take the
advice of one who does not know too much
about values generally, and get rid of their
stock as quickly as they can. Having said
that, the road is clear-none of us own any
railway stock.

SENATE
Seriously, it seems to me that the whole
system of railways should be viewed realistically, and the people of Canada should be
told what is happening.
The Canadian
National Railway should be put in a position
to compete reasonably and fairly with the
other great transportation system; it should
not be so burdened with debt as to be compelled to give a second-class service. While
I have no proof of what I am about to say,
and may be taken to task for saying it, I am
persuaded that a company with deficits running from $25 million to $40 million a year
cannot be managed-at least I could not manage it-as economically as if there were a
clear-cut obligation on the management to
balance its budget. Today no one would
accept the presidency of the Canadian
National Railways subject to an undertaking
to balance its budget. It could not be done.
You may say that it was donc during wartime, but in those years there was an extraordinary volume of traffic. If one rode on
passenger trains between here and my home
city, it was necessary to stand two hours to
get in a dining-car, and to apply two weeks
in advance to be sure of even an upper berth.
In those days two or three trains were moving between Ottawa and Montreal every
evening, and the line of freights was almost
endless. But those times have gone, and
unless there is another war they will not
return.
I make no accusation on this score against
the government, but it is a fact that they are
not charging interest on advances to the road
other than by way of capital invested in
railway equipment and improvements.
I would strongly recommend that this house
apply itself next session to a study of this
railroad problem. I believe that thereby we
could make such a contribution to the
nation's economic wellbeing as can be made
by no other body. Our study of income tax
law resulted in some valuable recommendations, and while the government were reluctant for a year or two to accept them-for
which I blame officials rather tlan ministers
law was subsequently amended in
-the
accordance with our proposals. A similar
opportunity is open to us in connection with
the railways. We should assemble the facts
governing, for instance, the entire financial
structure of both the Canadian National and
Canadian Pacific Railways, and say what in
our opinion could be done about it. We
could not be accused of prejudice in the
matter, because, as I have suggested, none
of us own any stock in the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and no Canadian National stock is
on the market. There are in this house men
and women who possess the experience necessary to solve this problem.

In the Prairie Provinces the subject of
transportation is a very important and controversial one. We have no system of waterways through which rates might be reduced,
nor have we the density of population and
the volume of traffic which would help to
this end. With the aid of the rest of Canada,
and for the purpose of providing a cheaper
route to world markets for our grain and
cattle, a line was constructed to Fort
Churchill. I never believed that it would be
economically successful, and it never has
been. Some day, perhaps, with the provision
of new aids to navigation, conditions will
improve, but there is no sign of improvement
at the present time. Our grain, cattle and
hogs must be taken down to the water-front
at Fort William. When wheat is selling at
one and a half to two dollars a bushel and
beef cattle are running at $200 a head, the
transportation charges can be met; but when
the price of wheat falls to 75 cents a bushel
and cattle sell for about $50 a head, the
burden on the producers is very serious. So
if we are to give these people a break, we
must try to solve this railroad problem. I do
not favour subsidies. I think our business
is not to set a rate but to determine the fundamental facts of the railway situation, so that
the people of Canada can decide in the light
of those facts what should be done.
I shall vote for the bill, but with my eyes
We are certainly handing
wide open.

Railways.

CANADIAN

NATIONAL

RAILWAYS

FINANCING AND GUARANTEE
BILL, 1949
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 148, an Act to authorize
the provision of moneys to meet certain
capital expenditures made and capital
indebtedness incurred by the Canadian
National Railways System during the calendar
year 1949, and to authorize the guarantee by
His Majesty of certain securities to be issued
by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: The bill before us-and honourable senators will recall that a similar one

DECEMBER 5, 1949
comes before us each year-proposes to do
three things. It would authorize the Canadian National Railway to issue securities to
the value of $19,766,890 in order to cover
necessary capital expenditures in the calendar
year 1949. It would also authorize the Minister of Finance to advance certain money to
the railway in order that it may meet its
current obligations that will result because
revenues are not sufficient to meet expenditures. The third thing the bill would do is to
authorize the Minister of Finance to advance
money to Trans-Canada Air Lines in the event
of their expenses being greater than their
revenue.
Sections 2 to 9, inclusive, of the bill, deal
with the first proposal I have mentioned,
namely, to authorize the railway to issue
securities to cover capital expenditures. When
this year's budget of the Canadian National
Railway system was presented, it revealed
that capital expenditure in the amount of
$35,504,890 would be required. To cover this
sum there is available from reserves for
depreciation and debt discount amortization
an amount of $15,738,000. This leaves $19,766,890 that must be borrowed. Section 2
authorizes the railway to issue securities to
obtain this money. However, the time may
not always be suitable for the issuing of such
securities.
Section 3 of the bill provides that the Minister of Finance may make advances to the
railway on account of authorized capital
expenditure until such time as is deemed
appropriate for the issue of securities. The
Minister of Finance charges interest on these
advances varying from 1 per cent to 2 per
cent, depending on the length of the loan.
Section 4 provides for the issue of securities
to repay these advances.
Section 5 designates how money so raised
on account of capital needs may be spent.
Sections 6 and 7 provide that the Governor
in Council may guarantee any authorized
issue of securities by the railways.
Section 9 deals with the second proposal
that I mentioned in my opening remarks. The
budget of the Canadian National Railway for
this year indicates a deficit on current operations of $37,800,000. This section would
authorize advances to cover such obligations
of the railway as cannot be met out of
revenue.
Honourable senators, it must be remembered that this is not a vote to cover the
anticipated deficit of the railway. When the
annual report is presented to parliament, and
the deficit is determined exactly, parliament
will be asked to vote moneys to cover the

deficit. The advances made by the Minister of
Finance, under section 9, will be re-imbursed
from that vote.
Section 10 is similar to section 9, except
that it applies to the Trans-Canada Air Lines,
and authorizes advances by the Minister of
Finance to cover any expenses that cannot be
paid out of revenue. These advances, like the
advance to the railway, must be re-imbursed
to the Minister of Finance from the revenues
of the Trans-Canada Air Lines, in so far as
such revenues are sufficient, and any insufficiency shall be provided for by a subsequent
vote of parliament.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I wonder if the Trans-Canada Air Lines would
lose money if they issued passes three times
a year to senators who live in the eastern and
western provinces? I often think how nice it
is that honourable senators who live close by
can get home fairly frequently, and I am sure
that those of us who live further away would
like to get home once in a while to see what
our homes look like. For instance, during the
current session I have only been home for
Thanksgiving. If the TCA is operating at a
loss, it would hardly make any difference to
it if it were to carry a few senators two or
three times a year. I offer this suggestion to
the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) in the hope that he
will bring it to the attention of the Minister
of Transport. We all know the minister is a
fine gentleman, but we would think he was a
lot finer if he would pay heed to these
lamentations.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will gladly bring this
suggestion to the attention of the Minister of
Transport.
Hon. J. A. Lesage: Honourable senators,
I fully agree with the proposal of the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I, too, feel we should receive passes to travel
by airplane, and I think that this suggestion
should be put to the Minister of Transport.
Hon. Gustave Lacasse: Honourable senators, I also am in agreement with the suggestion of the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig), but I should like to see it
extended further. I am not a frequent
traveller by air, but I have done enough
flying to know that most of the time TCA
planes are half empty. During the war we
were quite willing to submit to air-travel
priorities, but the war is over now and
most of the planes, especially those which
travel by night, are half empty or half full
-whichever way you like to express it.
I strongly support the suggestion that has
been made, but I think it should apply to
other senators as well as those who live

SENATE

HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
MOTION

The Senate resumed fromn Wednesday.
November 23, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Honourable Mr. Roebuck, that the
government be requested to submit to, the
fcorthcoming Dominion-Provincial Conference
on the Constitution a draft amendment to the
British North America Act.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, this motion of the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity has been on the Order
Paper for some time, and a number of
speeches have been made on it. At the outset I had not intended to speak on this
motion, but having read it over several times,
and after a good deal of counsel on the subject, I have decided to express my views.
I do not feel that 1 can vote for the motion,
but I have been niuch impressed by what is
calledl "The Canadian Bihl of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms". The remarks
off the honourable senator fromn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) appeahed to me
very much, and if I may I will quote the first
paragraph of his speech. He said:
Honourable senators will recollect that when the
honourable senator from De Salaberry <Hon. Mr.
Gouin) presented te tbis chamber on June 26, 1948.
the report of the special Joint Committee on Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, he laid on the
table a resolution adopted by the International
Commission on Human Rights at Lake Success on
June 18, 1948.
That document will be found
recorded at page 683 of the Debates of the Senate for
that year. The senator from De Salaberry will also
recolleot that the Lake Success resolution followed.
in somewhat condensed form, the International
Declaration on Human Rights adopted, at Geneva on

DECEMBER 5, 1949
the 17th of December, 1947. Canada voted for that
resolution. The draft bill, which constitutes part
of the resolution I have just moved, is an adaptation of these two documents to suit the Canadian
situation and the purpose in hand, and is drawn by
the officers of a committee for a Bill of Rights, of
which Mr. B. K. Sandwell, editor of Saturday Night,
of Toronto is president, and Mr. Irving Himel, a
well-known and active barrister of my city, is
secretary. The committee's membership includes
many men and women of prominence and distinction resident throughout Canada, from Vancouver
to Antigonish.

I read that paragraph to show how the
work of the committee is connected with
what has happened at the meetings of the
United Nations. I think the Senate should
thank that joint committee for the work
which it did on this subject.
I believe that we in Canada are not ready
for such a bill of rights as this motion proposes; in any event, I could not support a
motion to inject such a contentious matter
into the midst of the Dominion-Provincial
Conference, which I am sure will have enough
to consider, and such a proposal might well
confuse the issues.
One finds quite a divergence of opinion on
this subject amongst even the able writers
across the border. I have in my hand the
December issue of the United Nations Word,
which contains an article written by Laura
Vitray entitled "Mr. Truman and the UN."
Under the sub-heading of "Human Rights
Covenant" she says in part as follows:
When Truman made respect for human rights the
first cornerstone of American policy in the UN, he
knew that the fight in the UN for a universal
declaration of human rights was child's play compared with the one there will be to achieve a
covenant on human rights. For the declaration is
merely a statement of the rights men are entitled
to-if they can get them. The covenant-or international treaty-means application, implementation,
interference by a world body, when national courts
violate the covenant.

She goes on to say:
How sharp and how bitter that battle will be
can be judged by the arguments over the declaration. At San Francisco the nations found it easy
to write into the preamble to the UN charter a
pledge of co-operation "in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion." Yet they wrangled for two
years in the Commission on Human Rights to
produce the declaration; and in Paris, the committee
of the Third General Assembly assigned to give the
document a quick once-over, fought its way through
85 sizzling round-tables before reporting it back to
the main body.
What developed in these hot sessions was that
there is not one concept of human rights-there are
many.

As I said before, I wonder very seriously
whether Canada is ready for such a sweeping
bill of rights. I am of the opinion that a lot of
hard work will have to be done before the
Canadian Bill of Rights would be satisfactory
to the Canadian people as a whole. I feel

that some sections need revision. For instance,
if Article 7 were literally enforced, would
it not require a change in our present police
system? Many men are arbitrarily arrested
today. There are times when, in the interest
of law, order and good government, it is
necessary to make what might be called
arbitrary arrests. Let us suppose that a
murder has been committed. The police start
working on the case. They reach a point
where they feel almost certain whom to
arrest, but they have not yet secured all the
evidence. They may feel that they have not
yet got enough evidence to get a conviction,
or even to make an arrest. At the same time
they hear rumours that their number one
suspect is about to leave the town or district,
so they arrest him for vagrancy or some other
charge on which they can hold him for
twenty-four or forty-eight hours, until they
can complete their case against him. That, in
my humble opinion, is arbitrary arrest.
Nevertheless I think most of us will admit
that it is necessary in the interest of law,
order, and good government.
To lay down a law that no person is to be
arbitrarily arrested would certainly complicate the work of the police, because there are
many times when they make arrests in an
arbitrary manner, yet they do it in the interest
of law and order.
For example, under the highway laws of
the province of Ontario, a motorist who,
having been involved in an accident, forthwith leaves the scene of the accident is liable
to be arbitrarily arrested, thrown into prison,
and kept there to await trial.
Again, the other day we discussed in committee Bill 63, clause 8 of which provides
thatAn inspector or constable may arrest without
a warrant any person found committing an offence
under this Part and shall forthwith take any person
so arrested before a justice of the peace to be
examined and dealt with according to law.

What is that but arbitrary arrest?
We now come to Article 15. It reads as
follows:
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion; this right includes freedom
to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either
alone or in community with others, and in public
or private, to manifest his religion or belief in
teaching, practice, worship and observance.

I like that very much indeed. It strikes a
most responsive chord in my heart. But
would the people of Canada endorse it? Do
all the people of Canada really believe that
every man and woman has a right to freedom of thought? I doubt it. I doubt it very
seriously. We all give loud lip-service to
Article. 15, but are we serious? If we are,
then we should follow these ideas to their
logical conclusion. What kind of freedom are

DECEMBER 5, 1949

Honourable senators, Canada is growing up,
and we have had tangible evidence of this
fact here during the present session. Since
we began sitting in the fall we have passed
through this chamber bills to abolish appeals
to the British Privy Council, and to give us
the power to amend our own constitution. We
are becoming a free and adult nation, and I
am sure that every honourable senator is
glad that it is so.
But the censorship of books is one matter
upon which we have not reached adult
stature, and this is a restriction on our
national life about which I feel very strongly.
In another place on November 3, in a discussion about the censorship of books, the
question was asked: Who is the censor? And
how many books, journals, and comics have
been denied or refused admission by the said
censor during 1948 and 1949? The reply was:
Censorship in its broadest sense is not exercised by the Customs Division, but the department is responsible for the administration of
item 1201 of the Customs Tariff, which prohibits the entry of publications of a treasonable, seditious, immoral or indecent character.
This item 1201 seems to give a very dangerous
power to someone in the department. We
were told that in 1948, under tarifT item 1201,
forty-five books, and twenty-three newspapers and magazines were refused entry
into Canada, while in 1949, eighty-one books,
and twenty-two magazines and newspapers
were refused admission.
Honourable senators, before I discuss this
matter further, let me make it quite plain
that there is nothing personal in what I am
going to say. It is a bit unfortunate for me
that the matter of censorship comes under the
Department of National Revenue; but it is
purely incidental. I am quite sure that the
minister and the deputy minister carry out
the work of the department in accordance
with the Act governing censorship. My complaint is against the Act which permits the
censorship. If you will pardon a personal
reference, I should like to say-to completely
clear myself of any personal feeling in the
of National
matter-that the Minister
Revenue has been a warm friend of mine for
thirty years. When I lived in Renfrew he
was my friend and personal physician, and
several of my family still bear scars which
testify to his skill as a surgeon. When he
entered the government, the people of Canada
enlisted the services of a hard-working and
conscientious minister, and the Ottawa Valley
lost a skilled surgeon. I know the Minister of
National Revenue better and more intimately
than I know any other Cabinet minister. I
know that he is an honourable man who
administers his department competently and
without fear or favour. His deputy also is

a friend of mine. In any event, some of the
things about which I wish to complain took
place long before the present minister took
office.
Having cleared up that point, let me now
turn to this matter of censorship. Eighty-one
books were banned from Canada during this
year, and I should like to know what books
they were, and why they were banned. We
are told there has been no examiner of publications since July 17, 1942, so I take it that
some official of the Department of National
Revenue, who is an unofficial examiner,
decides to some extent what I shall read and
what I shall not read. God gave me, I am
thankful to say, a fairly generous amount of
brains and intelligence, and I think I have
enough of both to decide what is good for
me and what is not, and I am quite sure
that most members of this honourable body
feel the same way. I object strongly to any
officer of the department, in charge of
censorship, deciding what are the right and
proper books for Canadians to read. This
is a most dangerous power to put into the
hands of an anonymous member or members
of a department of government.
I feel that the present system should be
changed. Let us bring it right out in the
open. Let us know who is doing the censoring, and what books are banned and why.
And, by all means, let us know the qualifications of the person or persons who are acting
as our moral mentors. There is too much
paternalism about this book-banning business;
too much fear that those who read them will
not have sufficient ability to judge them
for themselves.
I hope honourable senators will pardon a
rather light personal reference, but when I
was a boy I read every Deadwood Dick dime
novel I could lay my hands on. I can still
recall how avidly I devoured, on a Welsh
hillside, "Deadshot Dandy, the Hero of Red
Gulch", and Alfrida the Man Tracker, and the
Sign of the Five Bullets. Reading those books
did not do me one bit of harm, and I do not
think this type of reading would harm anybody today.
Honourable senators, if I as a Canadian
citizen am going to be entitled-as article 16
of the new Canadian Bill of Rights statesto "freedom of opinion and expression," and
if I am further to have the right "to seek,
receive, and impart information and ideas
through any media and regardless of
frontiers", then I claim the right to know
who is stopping me from receiving some of
that information and some of those ideas.
This is a very serious matter. I do not
like censorships or controls of any kind.

SENATE
Some of them, including censorship of newspapers, were necessary during the war, but
now the war is over, and we should be most
careful about trying to arbitrarily control
the minds of our citizens, or to interfere
with their reading and study.
For that
reason I welcome article 16 of the proposed
Canadian Bill of Rights.
This is not a new complaint with me. In
our two newspapers, the Kingston WhigStandard, and the Peterborough Examiner,
we publish a book-review column nearly
every week. These reviews are written by
able, well-educated men. We try to do a
good job for our readers, and I know that
other newspapers do the same. In discussing books with the men who write these
reviews on many occasions, and also with
other people of a literary turn of mind, I
have listened to complaints about the banning of certain books from circulation in
Canada. With some of these books I have
been familiar.
I remember well some twenty years ago
being told by a friend of mine in the book
business, that the bookstore in an Ontario
city in which he worked had a copy of
D.
H.
Lawrence's
famous
book
Lady
Chatterley's Lover.
This book, although
banned in Canada, was being offered for sale
for a private party, at a price of $125 a copy.
A year or two later I was in Paris and saw
the book on sale in a bookstore on the Rue
de Rivoli for what in our money would be
about $1.50, and I promptly went in and
bought a copy. I read it and enjoyed it very
much. It was, as were all D. H. Lawrence's
books, beautifully written; in certain parts
it was almost poetry in prose. I do not
know whether it is still banned from Canada
or not. If it is, it should not be, in my
opinion.
Admittedly it had some nasty
words in it, but we hear nasty words all the
time on the streets and in other places,
though of course not in the Senate. The
story was a pathetic one, and many of you
may be familiar with it. It dealt with an
English officer of good family, who came
back from the First Great War paralyzed
from the waist down. He wanted an heir
to his estates, so he agreed that his wife
should try to find a healthy man who could
act as his deputy in producing an heir. The
book had to do with a definite problen
that faced a married couple of substance
after World War I.
I may say that I used to have quite a
number of D. H. Lawrence's works, but that
was in the days when I used to lend books.
I have none of Lawrence's volumes today,
and I do not lend books any more.

At different times over a period of years
I have received a number of letters about
the censorship of books. Only last week a
complaint was sent to me about the banning
in Canada of A Rage to Live by John O'Hara.
I do not know the book at all, but I made
some inquiries about it after I was written
to by a Canadian who was annoyed because
he could not buy it. The book supplement
of last week's New York Times ranked it third
in the list of fiction best sellers. I made some
inquiries and was told that the book was
at first let into Canada and afterwards
banned. Then the ban was withdrawn and
book publishers have been given one year's
reprieve on it. I wonder why there has been
a year's reprieve. If the book is of a kind
that should be banned from Canada, it seems
very inconsistent to allow it in for a year.
I have often discussed with people their
complaints about inability to obtain certain
books. I recollect that one of the members
of my own company's staff who was unable
to get a copy of a book entitled Painted Veils
claimed that once a book is banned in Canada
I do not know
it stays banned for ever.
whether this is true or not. I am told that
there is no machinery for reconsidering the
list of banned books, but until I have had
an opportunity to look into the matter I
should imagine that the list is reviewed
periodically. The book Painted Veils, written
by James G. Huneker, was published in 1920,
so present officials of the department had
nothing to do with the ban on it. When first
published the book created something of a
sensation, because it described the predicament of a young clergyman who got himself
involved with a group of opera singers and
was outraged by what he considered the
immorality of their conduct. I am informed
that few people reading it today would find
anything astonishing in it. It dealt with two
kinds of morality: the artistie morality and
integrity of artists and the morality of the
clergyman who had dedicated his life to the
service of God but who, as one writer put it,
had mistakenly created God in his own image.
These cases that I am citing, honourable
senators, have not been brought to my attention suddenly, but have accumulated over
several years. The problem which they raise
was revived in my mind by a recent court
case in the city of Brantford, tried before
Judge Cowan. Those of you who are familiar
with it will know that a news agent was
charged with selling an obscene book, which
I believe was called Amboy Dukes and was
about a group of young Brooklyn hoodlums.
As the Ottawa Journal pointed out, the judge
was confronted with a difficulty which always
arises in such cases: one set of witnesses

An example of the capriciousness of censorship
is given by the case of the Memoirs of Hecate
County, by Edmund Wilson, which was published in
1946 and banned in Canada within a month of its
publication, and before any more than a dozen or
so copies had reached this country. It would be
interesting to know if the censor had actually read
this book, or if he had merely read sensational
reviews of it in American papers.
The important point about the book is that it is
the work of Edmund Wilson, who is one of the
leading men of letters in the United States today.
In my opinion, it is not fair to the Canadian people
to keep it out of Canada without some consideration
for Mr. Wilson's great reputation.
The book is not written with an immoral purpose, but to prove a particular point. The book
contains a number of short stories, only one of
which would be considered offensive by an ordinary
reader. In that story a contrast is made between
the sexual behavicur of a group of poor and illeducated people and a group of wealthy and welleducated people, and the point that is made is that
people in either of these social spheres behave
badly and perversely if they lack moral courage.
The intention of the story is not to pander to dirty
minds, but to explain that dirty minds are pretty
much alike In all spheres of society.

United States,
Judge John M. Woolsey, of a New York district
court on December 6, 1933, and in the course of that
judgment he described the book as "a sincere and
serious attempt to devise a new literary method
for the observation and description of mankind."
It is a shame that this great book should be banned
from a supposedly intelligent and civilized country,
and it leads to contempt for the law, because there
are hundreds of copies of Ulysses in Canada In the
possession of scholars and people of literary leanings which have been smuggled into the country.
It can safely be said that these people are not
people who are looking for pornography, but people
with an absorbing interest in modern writing who
have to break the laws of their own country to
gratify that interest. It is an interesting point that
a young Canadian scholar named Hugh Kenner is
making a reputation for himself as a student of
the work of James Joyce, and that this young man
has had to go to the United States to get the
recognition which his work deserves, because the
main work of James Joyce is not permitted to enter
his own country. The ridiculousness of banning
Ulysses is further pointed out by the fact that
Joyce's last book called Finnegan's Wake Is permitted to enter Canada, although It Is in some
respects a much more exciting book than Ulysses,
but it is written In such a difficult style that presumably the censor did not take the trouble to
read it.

SENATE
Some honourable senators may have recently
read in the Ottawa Journal the following
quotation from the Brantford Expositor:
Here is another sideiight.
No later than a
few months ago a Brantford citizen ordered from
a thoroughly reputable pubiishing bouse in New
York a good edition of James Joyce's Ulysses. The
book got to the local Customs office and was clcared
to the purchaser, on payment of required duty.
But, Io and behold, a day or two later an officiai
of the said department waited upon the citizen
and demanded that the copy of Ulysses be returned.
For what reason? Because it had been discovered,
a trifle late, that Ulysses was on the banned list
and shculd not have been aliowed entry into this
moral land.
The unwitting violator of the code, in this case,
was not a peddler of improper "literature" but a
reputable and responsible citizen, and university
graduate with a taste for reading. Yet he was compelled, under protest, to return his book to the
Customs people.
Perhaps by coincidence, however, there came
from Ottawa, within a few more days, the gladsome tidings that dear old "Ulysses" had been found
(after all these years!) to be respectible and admissible after all. So, as soon as the appropriate yardage of red-tape had been unravelled, the slightly
annoyed citizen got his book again.

I must apologize to honourable senators
for speaking so long, but I felt that this was
an opportunity to say something about censorship, a matter which has concerned me for
some time. I do not go as far as to say that
we should not have some type of censorship.
What I do not like is the fact that books are
banned from this country without any explanation or right of appeal by some unknown
official whose opinion becomes law for some
13 million people. It is a very serious
matter.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamber: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I think he carefully omitted any reference to the rather
contentious subject of comic strips, which
now affects the newspapers in this country.
Does his attitude concerning the banning of
books apply to certain features coming under
the name of comic strips?
Hon. Mr. Davies: I presume the honourable
senator from Ottawa is referring to the bill
which is now in the other place, and which

does not deal with comic strips but with
crime comic books. I do not know of any
crime comic strips that are published in
newspapers, and I am quite sure none are
published in my paper. I think some judgment would have to be exercised in the
banning of such comic strips.

honourable gentleman a question? I think
he stopped his criticisrn of the Articles of

August 17, 1949, was summonded to the
Senate. Senator Penny is survived by his
wife and a daughter.
The late Senator Penny was one of the
most prominent businessmen of Newfoundland. His position in the fishing business on
the south coast of that province brought him
and his family into intimate contact with -the
lives of hundreds of people who were entirely
dependent on his business activities for their
very livelihood. I have been told by those
who knew the family well, that the household of our late esteemed colleague radiated
cheer, hospitality and helpful comfort to all
with whom its members came in contact, and
that it had no place for the narrow distinctions of race and creed that sometimes divides
man from man.
I sometimes think that those whose daily
lives are spent close to the great forces of
nature have, instinctively, a clearer perception of what is and what is not worth while
than those who live in more sheltered surroundings. So it is with those who live by
or on the sea. Life on the north Atlantic is
no child's play under the best of circumstances, and the ever-present danger of sudden storms creates a comradeship that transcends all narrow distinctions. So it was with
the family of our late colleague, who lived
to serve others.
Senator Penny was one of our junior members, having been with us for only a brief
period. He was confident that the union of
Newfoundland with Canada would help those
with whom he had lived and worked so long.
His death was untimely. We extend to his
widow and family our deepest sympathy, and
we affirm our conviction that he served his
fellow men well.
The Honourable Arthur Bliss Copp, P.C.,
of Westmorland, passed away at Newcastle,
New Brunswick, yesterday, December 5, 1949.
Senator Copp was born at Jolicure, Westmorland County, New Brunswick, on July
10, 1870. He was educated in the common
schools of that province, and graduated from
the provincial Normal School in 1888: after
teaching school for two years he attended
Mount Allison University, and later went to
Dalhousie University. In 1894 the late senator received the degree of LL.B. from Harvard
University. Since being admitted to the bar
of the province of New Brunswick in 1895,
he has practised law in Sackville, New
Brunswick.
Our late esteemed colleague was elected
to the legislature of New Brunswick in 1901,
representing Westmorland County, and held
that seat until 1912. He was elected te the
House of Commons in a by-election in 1915,

and re-elected in 1917 and 1921. In the latter
year he was sworn in as Secretary of State in
the King government. He was summoned te
the Senate on September 25, 1925.
Reason should have dictated that Senator
Copp, at his advanced age, might leave us
at any time, but his clear mind, his alert
step, and his cheery manner tended to make
us completely oblivious of this fact.
In the passing of our esteemed colleague,
Canada has lost an outstanding public man
and the Senate one of its most prominent
and esteemed members. He had been a member of the Senate for almost twenty-five
years. He variously served in the most
responsible posts. At the time of his death
he was Deputy Government Leader in the
Senate, Chairman of the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications, and
invariably served as chairman of his party's
caucuses. He brought to the consideration
of public questions a keen mind and penetrating criticism, both amplified by a long
and varied experience. At all times he took
his responsibilities as a member of the Senate
seriously, and was a faithful attendant of
its meetings both in the house and in committees. The Senate of Canada has in its
membership-and bas had-many outstanding public men and women who have contributed much to the consideration of public
questions. I believe that the late senator
from Westmorland will rank high among
them.
For my own part, and I speak personally,
I have lost a staunch friend and trusted
adviser. It would be difficult for me
adequately to discharge the debt of gratitude
that I owe for the services he rendered me
during the period of our intimate association.
He was considerate; he was loyal; he was
forthright, and solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.
I need not say to this house that, particularly during the first year or two after I had
assumed the responsibilities of the position I
now hold, I frequently had to call on him
for advice and counsel. It was at all times
cheerfully given, and invariably I found it
wise, sound and dependable.
When I said good-bye in the midst of
Thursday afternoon's session, I jocularly
added that it would not be for long, as we
would be meeting again soon. This brought
his characteristic reply "I'll be on deck".
But it was not to be, and yesterday he passed
quietly away. If his passing had to be, I
am thankful that it was quiet, peaceful and
painless.
To his close relations and his host of friends
who will mourn his passing, we extend our

SENATE

deepest sympathy. He will ever be remembered by his colleagues in this house, where
for so long be was a prominent and outstanding figure.

Hon. Antoine J. Leger: Honourable sena-

tors, for over half a century I have known
the Honourable A. B. Copp as a lawyer, as
a member of the Legislature of New Brunswick, as a member of parliament, as a
minister of the Crown and as a senator.
Like many of us, in his political life he
had known victory and defeat. But whether
in victory or in defeat he always maintained
that equality of temperament which made
him a favourite amongst his friends and a
good fellow amongst his opponents. In his
passing the Liberal party loses a man of
many friends, the county of Westmorland
a noble son, the province of New Brunswick
a valiant citizen, and the Parliament of
Canada a devoted, faithful and hardworking
servant.
I wish to extend to his wife and to his
relatives my most sincere sympathy.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I want to add my tribute to what has already
been said respecting Senator Copp, a very
dear friend of mine whose sudden death
we mourn this afternoon.
Senator Copp entered provincial politics for
the first time, in New Brunswick, in 1901,
forty-eight years ago, and was a familiar
figure in the political life of that province for
almost half a century. He was always successful, and the people of his constituency bad for
him a feeling almost of affection. He served
in civic, provincial and federal fields, and
from his long years of experience he acquired
wisdom and sound judgment as well as
a profound knowledge of parliamentary
procedure.
There is little that one can say on an
occasion such as this, except that Senator
Copp served his province and country well.
He gave generously of his best talents and
gifts in the service of his fellow citizens.
He was a staunch and warm friend, and
though be had almost reached the four-score
year mark, be was young in spirit and maintained a buoyancy which always made him
a charming companion.
He was a courageous man. During the past
few years be had been passing through the
deep waters of sorrow; but he never
burdened others with his troubles and be
faced the world each day with a smile,
always ready with a word of cheer. This
chamber, honourable senators, is poorer
because of his passing.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I join with the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) in a tribute to the
memory of the late Senator Penny from
Newfoundland. I was not well acquainted
with that gentleman; I just knew him as a
new member. He came here very highly
regarded in his own province. To his wife
and daughter I express the sincere sympathy
of every member of this house.
As I come to speak of Senator Copp, I
cannot but think of last Thursday afternoon.
I did not know he was going away until I
saw him saying good-bye to the leader of the
government. As he stepped into the aisle
be looked over at my desk and gave a slight
wave of his hand-almost as a lover would
to his girl friend as be was going away. It
was a gesture I did not expect; I was surprised, and happy, but the terrible thought
went through my mind, "I wonder what is
going to happen". That was all-I just
wondered what was going to happen. It was
a demonstration so unlike him: I knew it was
in him, but I did not expect it. Others on
this side saw the motion. I recall it to show
you that no matter what differences one might
have with the late senator he was always a
gentleman and always a friend.
This is an occasion when I can happily
remember that during nearly fifteen years
of association in this house I always held
him in very high regard for his integrity
and his judgment. Although we did not
always agree, when we diffiered we always
agreed to differ. Through the stability of his
judgment and the soundness of his common
sense be made a great contribution to the
Senate. As the leader of the government
has said, when we looked at him stepping
out of the chamber last week we could not
have imagined that within a day or two we
should be standing here to honour his
memory. At various times in conversation
with me be gave the impression that he had
burdens to carry which could not be avoided;
and to me it seemed that be carried them
with the resolution which proclaims a strong
character.
I join with the leader opposite in expressing a feeling which I believe is common to

of us may have to do the works and perf arm the duties expected of us. The sudden
deaths of two of our number, following each
other in tragic sequence, bring us this
unwelcome intelligence.
They also bring
to us a sense of shock and of the keenness
of personal lasses.
I shall attempt ta deliver no eulogy on
the if e of Senatar Copp. There are too
many members in this chamber who knew
him more intimately than I, and who can
more adequately do justice ta his memory.
Testimoniais ta his high qualities of heart
and mind, I arn sure, wili be many and
sincere. These characteristlcs, as assaciated
with the late Seniator Copp, were traditianai
and were given nation-wide recognition.
As a fellaw resident of New Brunswick,
thougli, I may assert that the late Senator
Copp has lef t upon the history of his native
province a record that time cannot efface.
This is a record of astuteness, keenness of
intellect, high integrity and moral nobility.
These are things that wiil neyer die. Fellow
senatars, while we regret his passing, we
realize that hie lived a life full of virtue
and honour, one which should prove a lesson
ta us in aur present-day endeavours and an
inspiration ta Canadian youth in the years
ta be.
I would like, hawever, ta make special
reference ta the late Senatar Penny. 1 wish
ta do so, particularly, because of bis comparative yauth and by reason of the fact
that hie was cut off in the fiawer of his if e
with ail his brighter days bef are hlm,
passessing, as hie did, s0 many of those
qualities which predestine one ta greatness.
As his room-mate and perhaps one of bis
closest assaciates in this assembly, I would
be mast remiss in my duties as a friend if I
did nat place upon the record some appreciation of these qualities. Indeed, fellaw-senators, had I been more familiar with house
procedure 1 would have prepared a tribute
more fitting ta the man and mare appropriate
ta this unhappy occasion. But despite this
disability and irrespective of how inexpertIy
and inadequately I may express my sentiments, 1 wish ta add a thought ta the kindly
references made by the honourabie the
leader of the Senate.
To thase mast intimately acquainted with
the late Senatar Penny, the sad intelligence
of his passing came with ail the poignant
elements of sarrow. Even thase who did
nat knaw him or have the appartunity of
caming within the range af bis charmn, but
who place a value upan 11f e, will maurn his
passing. He will be especially missed in
this chamber.
45785-27

There is in this assembly an especial
esprit de corps-not autwardly obtrusive, but
existing in substance. The passing of a
member, therefore, is particularly saddening.
Such a sad event represents the breaking
of aid threads of friendship, which cannot
be rewoven.
The ties of friendship meant much ta the
late Senator Penny. He had a great capacity
for friendship. He had aiso a great breadth
of charity. I neyer knew hlmi ta speak an
unkindly word of any persan. I neyer knew
him ta do an ungenerous act. In ail my
associations with the late senator, I neyer
heard hlm give voice ta any statement that
couid not bear the most searching scrutiny.
He was at ail times a most welcome companion. I arn sure that in a better worid he
will receive a most kindly greeting.
The kindliness, the courtesy, the gentiemanly character of the late Senator Penny
will live lang in my memary and I arn sure
ffhat these qualities wilsurvive in the
memory of ail senatars.
The knowledge that in life he was true
ta bis home, bis friends and ta the community
in which hie lived, must be a sustaining
thought ta those mast intimately affected
by sorrow at bis passing. That hie was faithful
in his duties to the state will, 1 arn sure, be an
added consolation ta the bereaved members
of bis f amily. To them I extend my sincere
and mast profound sympathy.
As a concluding word may I suggest that
two fine gentlemen have lived amaong us.
The world is richer for their living and we
personally
have
gained
immeasurably
through association with them. In the quiet
unabtrusive and elaquent wards af New
England's home paet, they were in truth
"men, whose lives glided on like rivers that
water the woadlands; darkened by shadows
of earth, yet reffecting an image af Heaven."
Haon. J. E. Sinclair: Honourable senators,
it is very rarely that I rise ta say a word
about departed members, but I feel tbat there
are circumstances connected with the passing
of the late Senator Copp which justify my
speaking at this time. I was associated with
him for the last thirty-two years in one or
other of the Houses of Parliament.
As others have pointed aut, Senator Capp
was a student of law at Dalhousie Law
School and Harvard University, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and hie received the degree af
LL.B. in 1894. He was admitted ta the Bar
of bis native province of New Brunswick in
the following year, and practised bis profession in bis home town af Sackville from
that time untîl he retired fram professional
activities. 1 knew him very intimately. He

SENATE
was always the same, and had many friends
in all walks of life. People consulted him on
matters wholly outside his profession, and
looked to him as a counselor and guide, and
he held the respect of all.
I first became closely associated with Senator Copp when parliament moved into this
building, in 1920. We then were both members of the other house and were assigned to
the same room; this we occupied until after
the election of 1920, when the late senator
was appointed Secretary of State and moved
to a room of his own. After coming to this
house, Senator Copp shared a room for some
years with the Right Honourable George P.
Graham, the then senator from Brockville.
My room-mate was the honourable senator
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King). In
1942 the honourable gentleman from Kootenay
East was appointed to succeed the late Senator Dandurand as leader of the government
in the Senate, and early in 1943 the Right
Honourable George P. Graham died. Senator
Copp then came to me and asked if we could
not arrange to occupy a room together once
again. I remember it distinctly. I told him
the matter was all in his own hands, and that
it would be a pleasure to me to do as he suggested. That was done, and we have been
room-mates ever since.
I came to respect him very highly. I do
not think I ever knew a man who had so
much character and lived up te it. His advice
was always given when required and was
always sound. One so close to him as I was
saw a side of his character which raised it
above the level of that of the ordinary person. He was good to everybody, especially
to the poor; to the limit of his ability he contributed, without any flare, to anyone whose
need came to his attention. I cannot speak
too highly of the character of Senator Copp.
I know that during the years when he and
Mrs. Copp lived here in Ottawa, as many who
are here today will remember, they were
very much attached to each other, and the
sickness that laid her aside was the one thing
that worried him. He really wished from
the bottom of his heart that he would be
spared to live till after she was gone. Well,
that was not to be. But I know that she is
provided for in a material way as well as if
he had continued to live. I am not aware that
Senator Copp has any other close relatives
living, except a sister in Western Canada.
I should like to join with the leaders on both
sides of the house in expressing our most
sincere sympathy.
I also wish to associate myself with what
has been said about the loss of one of our
senators from the newly added province of
Newfoundland. It is sad indeed that we
should lose a young man like Senator Penny,

so recently appointed to this chamber. Though
new to our ways and to our rules, he was
beginning to fit in very nicely with the work
of the house. I was greatly pleased to meet
him, as I know all senators were, and I join
sincerely in the sentiments of condolence
expressed by the leaders and others to his
wife and family.
NATIONAL
CONCURRENCE

DEFENCE BILL
IN

COMMITTEE

AMENDMENTS

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill J-5,
an Act respecting National Defence.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, it has occurred to me that in considering
amendments honourable members
these
would like to know the substance of some
of the more important of them. The committee made in all seventy-four amendments.
In some instances, where the amendment
related to the navy, army and air force, the
same amendment had to be made to three
sections. In the main the purpose of the
amendments was to provide what the committee regarded as full protection for individual members of the armed services who
might at any time find thernselves under some
disability before a court martial or other
official disciplinary body. The National
Defence Act has incorporated in it a code of
service discipline, and it was necessary, therefore, that this bill spell out the procedures
dealing with the rights of an accused person.
I wish to refer very briefly to a few of
the more important amendments, which are
set out in the Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate of Canada.
Amendment No. 23 deletes clause 103 of
the bill as it came before the committee.
This clause, which was very broad and
severe in its terms, provided as follows:
Every person who unlawfully sets fire to any
equipment, defence establishment or work for defence is guilty of an offence and on conviction is
liable to imprisonment for life or to less punishment.

The committee substituted a new clause
103, in even broader terms, in the following
language:
Every person who wilfully or neghigently or by
neglect of or contrary to regulations, orders or
instructions, does any act or omits to do anything,
which act or omission causes or is likely to cause
fire to occur in any equipment, defence establishment or work for defence is guilty of an offence
and on conviction, if he acted wilfully, is liable to
imprisonment for life or to less punishment, and in
any other case is liable to imprisonment for less
than two years or to less punishment.

Amendments 25, 26 and 28 deal with procedure before a court martial, and set out the

DECEMBER 6, 1949

rights of an accused person. Three amendments were necessary because the sections
amended.-135, 136 and 137-deal with the
navy, the army and the air force respectively.
In these cases we made it a requirement that
where a proceeding is being carried on by
way of a summary trial, the officer in charge
must inform the accused person of his right
to have the evidence taken on oath. That
becomes of some importance when one follows through the procedure as to appeals
which accused persons have from such a
proceeding.
Amendment 31 is important. It has to do
with section 150, which deals with the right
of an accused person to be represented before
a court martial. So that there may be no
uncertainty about this section, and no question of leaving it to rest upon regulations
that may subsequently be enacted, we have
written into the bill the following substantive
clause:
At any proceedings before a court martial the
accused person shall have the right to be represented in such a manner as shall be prescribed in
regulations.

I understand that the representation will
vary, depending upon the seriousness of the
offence with which the accused is charged.
Amendment 45 deletes clause 188 of the
bill, which has to do with the right of appeal
by an accused person, and substitutes
redrafted clause 188, so that no formality in
the preparation of a statement of appeal
would be required. A form for the statement
of appeal is to be supplied to the accused
when he has been convicted, but no informality in connection with the preparation of that
statement will militate against the rights of
such accused person.
Amendment 49 deletes sub-clause 3 of section 191 of the bill. At the insistence of the
members of the committee sub-clause 3 was
redrafted so as to state clearly the position
of a person who has been convicted on a
number of charges, and where on appeal the
conviction on one or more of the charges has
been set aside, leaving some convictions outstanding against him. The subsection is
rewritten to clarify the procedure for the
purpose of determining the quantum of sentence in relation to the conviction or convictions remaining against the accused.
Amendment 54 adds a new sub-clause 4 to
clause 199 of the bill, which gives to a convicted person the right, under certain circumstances, to request a new trial. The amendment removes all doubt about the position of
a person who has been convicted and has
served part of his sentence, and then discovers fresh evidence. Under the amendment
he may apply for a new trial, and if the
court, after hearing the additional evidence
45785-27J

concludes that the conviction should stand,
the question of sentence is then considered.
Assuming, as I have said, that the new trial
confirms the finding of "guilty", the sentence
which was cancelled or suspended pending
the new trial is restored, and the accused
does not serve any additional time beyond
that prescribed following his original trial.
Amendment 60 deletes clause 216 of the
bill. It relates to the protection of officers
and men acting in the line of duty under the
code of service discipline. It also applies to
that portion of the bill which relates to procedures to be followed when the military is
called out in aid of the civil power. The
committee felt that officers and men should
have ample and clear protection in relation
to anything done by them in the execution
of their duty.
I should call the attention of the house to
the closing paragraph of the report of the
committee. There were a number of sections
in the bill which dealt with the expenditure
of money-what we ordinarily call "money
clauses"-and as the Senate cannot initiate
bills dealing with money matters-and this
bill originated in the Senate-the committee
deleted from the bill the clauses set out in
the last paragraph of the report. Those
clauses will of course be restored when the
bill is considered in the other place.
Those, honourable senators, are the major
amendments contained in the report.
In conclusion I may say, by way of explanation, that the committee had before it the
present Attorney General for Canada and
senior representatives of the various armed
services. Throughout the meetings all members of the committee, and the representatives
of the department, evidenced a sincere desire
to get into statute form something which
would reflect the best thinking in the interest
of the defence of Canada, and which would
join together the various armed services for
disciplinary purposes. It was a co-ordinated
effort to work out provisions which would
not be unduly severe in their application
against persons who, unfortunately, may run
foul of military regulations. When suggestions were made by various members of the
committee a sincere effort was made to consider them, and in most cases they were carried into the amendments. The work of the
committee was directed towards maintaining
a proper spirit in the armed forces, and making doubly sure that the rights of the ordinary
service man would be protected in the same
way as those of the highest officer.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Am I to understand that if,
under section 199, a man asks for a new trial
and his application is granted, and he is again
found guilty and the old sentence re-imposed,
there can be no mitigation of that sentence?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. This situation might
occur: a man may have been court-martialled
and convicted; he may have gone through,
but without success, all the procedure for
mitigation of sentence, and then new evidence
may develop which is of such a nature that
he is granted a new trial. As a consequence,
of course, the original conviction and the
original sentence would have to be cancelled.
But if as a result of the new trial he is again
convicted, the sentence which was originally
imposed upon him is restored. At that stage,
however, there would still be open to him the
procedure applicable under the bill for the
mitigation or commutation of the sentence,
just as though it was then imposed for the
first time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Anyone who has looked over
the amendments must realize the splendid job
which the committee have done in reviewing
the bill. However, I wonder whether their
examination extended to subsection 8 of
section 121, which it seems to me, amounts
to one law for the rich and another for the
poor. In the case of exactly the same offence
a reduction in rank shall not be imposed on
an officer of or above the rank of lieutenantcolonel, but a major may be reduced in rank.
It looks to me as though an old air force rule
is being kept in force. I have never been able
to ses why the same punishment for the same
type of crime should not be imposed on a
private and a general. But here, as I have
pointed out, a major can and a lieutenantcolonel cannot be reduced in rank. Did the
committee give any consideration to that provision? If they did, I should like to know why
it was not changed. Could it be that they are
implementing a regulation made by lieutenant-colonels themselves? I do not know. But
that is my first question.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The committee had
several acting chairmen, and as I came in
at a late stage in the proceedings I am afraid
I cannot answer the question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is discrimination
under this clause, and I would like to have
it considered before the bill is passed, because
in my opinion once the bill becomes law
nothing will ever be done about it.
My other question bas to do with a point
of law, and perhaps a layman should not
make any suggestion regarding the law. But,
referring to section 141, it seems to me that
it should contain a provision that any advocate appointed should be a member of the
Judge Advocate-General's Branch. When a
man is brought before a court some question
of law may be involved, and the person
appointed to act for him may not know the
fine points of procedure. I think an accused

should have the advantage of being represented by an advocate who belongs to the
Judge Advocate-General's Branch. The clause
reads:
Such authority as is prescribed for that purpose
in regulations shall appoint a person to officiate as
judge advocate at a General Court Martial.
It does not require that hc shall be a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I point out to my

friend that apparently the procedure before
the court martial is that some person representing the Judge Advocate-General's office
must be present for the purpose of advising
the court with respect to admissibility of
evidence and any other points of law that
may come up. The matter of the representation of an accused person is entirely different.
Substantive authority is provided for under
the new section 150, and regulations to be
passed under this bill will deal with the
representation of an accused person. But that
is something entirely separate and distinct.
The Judge Advocate-General's representative
is not an advocate in the ordinary sense; he
is there as an adviser to the court martial on
questions of law, and invariably he is a
lawyer.
I move concurrence in the report of the
committee.

Hon. Mr. Golding: Before these amendments are concurred in, I should like to take
this opportunity of expressing to the various
chairmen who sat on this committee my
appreciation of the splendid work they did.
The clauses were carefully scrutinized and
considered, and the committee concerned with
this bill did a job which is worth mentioning
in complimentary terms. I have had some
experience of parliamentary committees, and
I have been deeply impressed with the splendid work which has been done by all Senate
committees whose proceedings and discussions
I have had an opportunity to attend.
There is another remark which I should
make at this time. I know that the Senate's
method of procedure in respect of its business
has been criticized. Having been here now
for a considerable time, let me say that in
my opinion the Senate would make a mistake
were it to attempt to create bere a second
House of Commons. At one time, I believe,
its rules were relaxed. I do not think that
any further encroachments in that direction
would be for the benefit of the Senate, and
I feel that I should say so at this particular
time.
Although I may be out of order, while I am
on my feet I should like to pay tribute to the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) and the leader of the opposition

DECEMBER 6, 1949
(Hon. Mr. Haig) for their fine work as chairman and vice-chairman respectively of the
Divorce Committee.
I may add that the kindly reception which
greeted me when I came to this honourable
body, and the great friendliness shown to me
since that time, will never be erased from my
memory. I sincerely hope that neither by
word nor act nor thought shall I do anything
to bring discredit to this chamber.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: May I thank the
honourable senator who has just sat down for
observations which I myself had in mind to
make on this occasion, and particularly for
his reference to the value of our committee
work?
I feel that the two senators who served as
chairmen of the Banking and Commerce Committee are entitled to some recognition for
the services they rendered in relation to this
bill; I also feel that the Senate itself has
grounds for some satisfaction in this connection.
Seventy-four amendments have been proposed in the report of the committee. I sat
through nearly all the committee meetings,
and was impressed with the effectiveness of
the system of sitting around a table and discussing the various clauses of the bill. Each
one of these amendments is to the twelfth
draft of the bill. This means that the bill had
been mulled over by the Judge Advocates of
the various services, the Judge Advocate
General and his assistants, and finally by the
Department of Justice. It is rather remarkable that each of the seventy-four amendments was made with the consent of the
Judge Advocates, who were present at the
committee meetings.
I also want to pay tribute to the Honourable
Hugues Lapointe, former Parliamentary
Assistant to the Minister of National Defence
and now Solicitor General, who headed the
military delegation. He maintained a goodnatured and open-minded attitude throughout
the sittings, and his lack of arrogance and his
readiness to accept amendments, when they
seemed to be sound, are to be commended.
I think I can speak on behalf of all members, and put on record the gratitude of the
committee to the various officers who sat
through the long sittings and furnished valuable information on innumerable occasions. I
do not know that I can name these officers
in proper order, but I do not suppose it makes
much difference what precedence they enjoy
when being referred to in this house. There
was Brigadier R. J. Orde, C.B.E., Judge
Advocate General; Major W. P. McClemont,
E.D., Assistant Judge Advocate General;
Wing Commander H. A. McLearn, Deputy

Judge Advocate General, and Commander P.
R. Hurcomb, R.C.N., Judge Advocate of the
Fleet. These four men, together with the
minister, supplied us with a surprisingly large
amount of information on military law and
procedure, and they contributed greatly to
the success which I think the committee
achieved.
Honourable senators, while I concur in all
seventy-four amendments, I should like to
move additional amendments to two clauses
remaining in the bill. It is my understanding
of the rules that I am privileged to move that
the house go into Committee of the Whole
for the purpose of considering this bill, but
I suppose I should do this after the report of
the committee has been approved.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: When the amendments have already been concurred in, what
is the Committee of the Whole going to donot concur in them?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have no objection whatsoever to the bill
being referred to the Committee of the Whole,
but if it is desired to proceed in this way I
would ask my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to let
the matter stand until the appropriate officials
can be brought before us. Technical officials
should be available here to enable me or
some other honourable senator to ýpresent
the reasons why any amendments proposed
should or should not be concurred in.
The Hon. the Speaker: As I understand it,
after the report has been concurred in a
motion for third reading should be made,
and then an amendment that the bill be not
read the third time would be in order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the correct
procedure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to ask for
some indulgence from this house. Remember,
honourable senators, this is a new procedure
to us. I recollect only one occasion when we
have gone into Committee of the Whole since
I came to the Senate. I have not been able
to get much assistance from a reading of the
rules, and so I trust that you will pardon me.
The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable
senator allow me to interrupt him? He is
out of order at present. When the motion
for concurrence in the report is carried, it
will then be moved that the bill be read the
third time, and in amendment to that motion
the honourable senator may move that the
bill be not read the third time now but that
the Senate go into Committee of the Whole
on the bill.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That will be entirely
satisfactory. I give notice now that I intend
to move such an amendment tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I say just a word? We
should vote on the committee's report first,
and if the amendments are concurred in it
would then be in order ta ilove the third
reading of the bill as amended. Then my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) could move the adjournment
of the debate until tomorrow, and in the
meantime he could intimate to the leader of
the government what amendments he proposes to move. That would enable the leader
to seek advice from departmental officials; in
fact, he could have the officials present
tomorrow and consult them from time to time.
Then when the bill comes up tomorrow the

honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
could move in amendment that the bill be

not now read a third time but be referred to
Committee of the Whole.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of Hon.
Senator Hayden, seconded by Hon. Senator
Howard, that the report be concurred in.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
there are a few remarks that I wish to make

before the motion is voted upon. I wish to
concur in what has been said by previous
speakers as to the work of the committee
that dealt with this bill. The Judge Advocate
General and the chiefs of the legal branches

of the three services were present at all meeting of the committee and gave a great deal
of assistance.
What struck me particularly about the
whole bill was what one might call its
humanity. It seemed to me that the principal

part of the bill, which is a code of service
discipline, had obviously been designed to

give every opportunity for a fair trial to any
man who happened by some mischance to
fall foul of the code's provisions. That, I
venture to suggest, is something rather new
in military history. It is not always that the
man in the ranks of the army or navy has
had a fair trial, and the reason for that is,
I think, fairly obvious.

Our militia bills stem

from many years back, even from centuries
back, at a time when, to be perfectly frank,
the military and naval forces of Great Britain
were recruited from the dregs of the population. The men had no rights whatever, and
it might have been considered dangerous to
give them any rights. It is not much more
than one hundred years ago since the British
navy was recruited by press gangs, which
went around the streets of towns in the dead
of night and picked up all the drunk and
disreputable men that could be found. The
same was more or less true of the army.

Some honourable senators may remember the
story told of an inspection made by the Duke
of Wellington shortly before the battle of
Waterloo. After looking over a new regiment
which had been sent out to him from England
he said, "I do not know how these men will
appear to the enemy, but, by God, they
frighten me." Well, that indicates the kind
af men recruited by Great Britain for her
army and navy about a hundred and fifty
years ago, and it was for that kind of men
that the service discipline of the two forces
was designed.
But conditions now are entirely different.
Today we have what one might almost call a
civilian army, a civilian navy and a civilian
air force. At one of our committee meetings,
only three or four weeks ago, the Minister
of National Defence told us that to be eligible
for enlistment in the permanent armed services of this country a boy now had to have
a high school leaving certificate. So honourable senators will appreciate the vast difference there has to be between the code of
service discipline necessary to deal with our
Canadian boys who enlist in the services
today and the code that must have existed
in the former years of which I have spoken.
I have only one more thing to say, and
that is to re-emphasize what some senators
said a few moments ago. It does seem to me
that the work done by the committee on this
bill is a rather striking example of the
valuable work which committees of this house
can do. At all meetings of the committee the
Solicitor General and four representatives of
the services were present and were extraordinarily helpful to us with their suggestions
and comments on various sections of the bill.
Owing to shortage of time there is no likelihood that the bill will be adopted in the other
house this session, but I think that next
session we shall have a good workable
measure to submit to parliament.
The motion was agreed to and the report
was concurred in.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: When the bill comes up
tomorrow I shall move in amendment that
it be not read a third time but be referred to
the Committee of the Whole.
EXCISE TAX BILL
SECOND READING
On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 175, an Act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.

DECEMBER 6, 1949
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to handle this
bill.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
should not give us much concern, for when
taxes are coming down people are usually
in a fairly happy frame of mind. What this
bill seeks to do is give legislative sanction
to tax reductions that in the main have been
in force since March of this year. It will be
noticed that the bill contains fourteen sections,
and that eight of them deal with tax reductions. The revenue which is lost to the
Government of Canada by reason of the
reduction in rates on some items, and the
repeal of taxes on others would, in the fiscal
year, amount to approximately $96 million.
The sections which deal with reductions in
rates are Nos. 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
By some of the sections there is a complete
repeal of certain taxes, as for instance by
section 1, which repeals parts IV and V of the
Excise Tax Act. Part IV imposed a tax on
cable, telegraph and telephone messages and
on telephone extensions. Part V imposed a
tax on transportation tickets or rights of
transportation and on seats, berths, and other
sleeping accommodation. By way of illustration, I may say that the amount of revenue
gained in the past fiscal year from the tax on
these items amounted to approximately $29
million.
Section 3 of the bill repeals sections 76 and
77 of the Act, which deal with excise tax on
matches on the basis of so many matches to
a box. This tax is to be replaced by a percentage tax of ten per cent. The revenue loss
by reason of this change is approximately
$2 million.
Subsection 9 of section 80 of the Act, which
is repealed by section 5 of the bill, imposed a
tax of one cent per bottle on soft drinks;
and by another section in the Act a tax of
25 per cent was levied on this commodity.
The revenue earned from those taxes during
the past fiscal year was almost $28 million.
Part XVII and Schedule VI of the Act are
repealed by sections 9 and 13 of the bill,
respectively, which have to do with the retail
purchase tax on jewellery, fountain pens and
similar items. There is a proposed change
over from the 25 per cent tax on the retail
price to a 10 per cent tax on the manufacturer's price.
Other taxes which are repealed are, for
instance, the tax on motor buses, candies,
chocolates and chewing gum. The total

revenue gained from taxes on these items in
the past fiscal year amounted to approximately $27 million.
Other articles on which the retail purchase
tax has been changed to a lower tax on the
manufacturer's prices are such things as toilet
articles, lighters, slot machines, trunks,
luggage of all kinds, smokers' accessories,
fountain pens, carbonic acid gas and tires.
When taxes are being taken off or substantially reduced, I suppose our attitude in the
main should be not to reason why. We should
gladly accept the reduction and bid the government keep up the good work.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Right.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Sections 2, 4 and 8 of the
bill are administrative. Section 2 simply
permits the use of a postage meter for affixing
postage stamps for purposes for which excise
stamps ordinarily would be used. For
instance, if a man wants to put a stamp on a
cheque, and he has only a postage stamp
meter, the bill gives legal authority for the
use of the postage stamp meter. As everyone
knows, the practice, when one does not have
an excise stamp, is to use a postage stamp on
a cheque. Under the Act one could not use
the postage stamp meter for stamping a
cheque, although he could affix a postage
stamp by hand. The bill gives sanction to
what has been the practice for some time.
Section 4 of the bill makes it an offence
for one to have in one's possession unstamped
cigarette papers. Quantities of this article are
easily removed in small bundles from a factory, and the department has learned that a
substantial loss of revenue is suffered because
of illicit traffic in these papers.
The next section I wish to refer to is
section 8.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Before the honourable
senator goes to section 8, may I ask him if
the taxes referred to in section 6 are
increases or decreases?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was going to deal
with section 6 later, but I can refer to it
now. Paragraph (a) of section 83(1) provides
for a decrease. May I deal with that a little
more fully? Apparently the export apple
market was dwindling by reason of the fact
that the United Kingdom is not taking apples
from us in the quantity that it once was.
Representations were made to the government indicating that there would be a substantial market for fermented cider containing not more than 7 per cent absolute alcohol
by volume. In order to encourage that trade,
and so provide some outlet for the apple
crop, the tax has been reduced. In the case
of wines of any kind containing not more
than 7 per cent absolute alcohol by volume,

SENATE

the tax is 25 cents per gallon. The rates of
tax on wines containing more than 7 per cent
of proof spirit remain exactly as they are
in the Excise Tax Act. Paragraph (a) of this
section does provide a reduction, otherwise
the tax would be 50 cents per gallon. The
department feels that in providing that the
content be not more than 7 per cent absolute
alcohol by volume, it is encouraging the
development of a new market for fermented
cider. It still remains to be seen whether
that market will be developed or not.
I now come to section 8.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Do paragraphs (b) and
(c) of section 83 (1) cover reductions?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, those clauses exist
in the present section 83, but not exactly
in the same form. Section 83 as it now stands
provides as follows:
(a) a tax of fifty cents per gallon on wines of
all kinds, except sparkling wines, containing not
more than forty per cent of proof spirit;
(b) a tax of two dollars and fifty cents per gallon
on champagne and all other sparkling wines.
One can see there is no change with respect
to paragraphs (b) and (c); all that has been

done is squeeze something out of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of section 83 of the Act, and
make a new paragraph (a).
May I go for a moment to section 8?

sections 8

and

9

of this section

Sub-

read

as

follows:
(8) Where any question arises in a proceeding
under this Act as to whether the minister has
formed a judgment or opinion or made an assessment or determination, a document signed by the
minister stating that he has formed the judgment
or opinion or made the determination or assessment
is evidence that he has formed the judgment or
opinion or made the determination or assessment
and of the judgment, opinion, determination or

assessment.

(9) In any proceedings under this Act a certificate purporting to be signed by the deputy minister that a document annexed thereto is a document or a true copy of a document signed by the
minister shall be received as evidence of the docu-

ment and of the contents thereof.

The reason for that change is that in a
recent court case such a certificate

of the

minister was rejected as evidence because,
the trial judge said, there was no statutory
authority for admitting it. The amendment
is not as ominous or important as it may
sound; I for one am not ready at any time

lightly to give up established rights or to
weaken the processes of proof.
But let me refer to section 113, subsection
8 of the Excise Tax Act:
Where a person bas, during any period, in the
opinion of the minister, failed to keep records or
books of account as required by subsection one of
this section, the minister may assess
(a) the taxes or sums that he was required, by
or pursuant to this Act, to pay or collect in, or in
respect of, that period, or

(b) the amount of stamps that he was required,
by or pursuant to this Act, to affix or cancel in, or
in respect of, that period, and the taxes, sums or
amounts so assesed shall be deemed to have been
due and payable by him to His Majesty on the day
the taxes or sums should have been paid or the
stamps should have been affixed or cancelled.

All that means is that the ordinary method
of proof seens to consist of two steps: first,
that the minister shall have formed the
opinion that the particular person failed to
keep records, and shall then make the assessment; and in order that there may be
evidence of the two essentials referred to
in section 113 (8) the legal advisers feel it
necessary to have certificates to establish,
first, that the minister finds that the person
has failed to keep books of account as
required, and second, the assessment in
respect thereof.
Another section of similar import is section
98, which merely provides that:
Where goods subject to tax under this Part or
Part XI of this Act are sold at a price which in the
judgment of the minister is less than the fair price
on which the tax should be imposed, the minister
shall have the power to determine the fair price ...

It is to put the matter in a form which
would be admissible in a court proceeding
that section 8 in the bill before us provides
for a certificate of the minister indicating his
judgment and determination.
One other section to which I might refer
is section 87 of the Excise Tax Act, which
deals with goods manufactured or produced
in Canada under circumstances or conditions
which render it difficult to determine the
value thereof for consumption or sales tax.
In these circumstances the minister may

determine the value for tax purposes. Provision is now made for a method of proof;
that is by production of a certificate which

may be filed and be accepted in evidence in
a proceeding for the purpose of collecting
such tax, and so obviate the necessity of the
minister going into court and giving evidence.
I should refer also to sections 5 and 7.
The wording is pretty much the same, and
they relate to the same subject-matter, except
that section 5 deals with excise tax and
section 7 with sales tax. At the present time
excise tax and sales tax are collected on a
watch movement. If a person selects a case
and works and a jeweller puts them together,
the taxes are on the parts. But by sections
5 and 7 it is declared that the operation by
which a lock or watch movement is put
into a clock or watch case, and other related
acts are done, constitute a manufacturing
operation, and the taxes are to apply on the
flnished article: that is, excise and sales
taxes are imposed at the level of the finished
product instead of, as heretofore, on the
various components.

DECEMBER 6, 1949
Hon. Mr. Reid: If one were simply to have
a wrist-strap attached to a watch, would the
provisions of these clauses apply?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the man went to a
jeweller and said, "With that particular type
of works, that particular case, that particular
crystal and that special type of strap, all of
which you have, I want you to make me a
wrist-watch," the taxes would apply to the
completed wrist-watch.
There is one other feature which I should
mention. Last October a further reduction
of sales tax arose through the repeal of a
tax which theretofore applied on fuel oil.
The estimated saving to the people of Canada
as a result of this reduction will amount
to about $4,000,000.
I have now discussed all the provisions of
the bill. Most of what it proposes is a
fait accompli, and gives legal sanction to
benefits which the people are already enjoying; so I do not propose to refer the bill to
any committee unless some honourable senators feel that it should be sent there after
having received second reading.
Hon. W. D. Euler: The honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has
explained that the amendments contained in
this bill are made only in order that the law
will conform to the provisions in the Budget;
and, as he has said, the changes are almost
entirely in the direction of reductions of
taxes. I have no objection to make to any
item named in the bill, although 1, in common
I suppose with almost all other citizens,
would have liked to have seen the reductions
made a little larger and perhaps a little more
numerous. In speaking of them as being
numerous, I have before me a list of the
exemptions from sales tax, and it is to one
phase of these exemptions that I propose to
address myself.
If you look through the list of exemptions
in the schedules you will find that they extend
to almost six pages. Schedule III, which I
think is the most important, deals with foodstuffs. I may, perhaps, be pardoned if I give
a list, a very incomplete list, of some of the
foodstuffs which are exempt from sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I hope butter is not included.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Butter is here. It begins
withBarley; Bread; Butter; Cheese; Eggs; Egg albumen
and Egg yolks; Glucose; Honey; Ice; Lard; Rice;
Salt; Soups; Split Peas; Sugar; Yeast ...
Bakers' cakes and pies ...

Hon. Mr. Robertson: We are past the "M's".
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then followSpaghetti ...
Vegetables . . .
Vegetable juices . . .

I have named these merely to show that the
list of articles exempted from sales tax is a
pretty long one. These are foods, and I think
that if anything is entitled to exemption from
taxes it is the food of the people. I might
continue the list, but I shall merely cite a
few headings to show that the law goes a
good deal further than the exemption of
foods which are most important. For instance,
among the items I find bees, and beet pulp.
I suppose the latter is food for animals and
not for human beings; but food is listed for
fur bearing animals whose pelts have commercial value. I think this should interest
my honourable friend from Mount Stewart
(Hon. Mr. McIntyre). Then there is oil cake,
which is also food for animals. I think, too,
that the newspapers get off pretty lightly in
the matter of sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, yes, they do. I happen
to be in the business myself.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: There is no sales tax on
magazines and weekly newspapers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I would put it to the Post
Office authorities as to just how far the
newspapers are exempt. There are exemptions on such things as building materials
and so on, but I am not going to deal further
with them. When I was talking about foodstuffs I noticed that some honourable senators
were smiling. They probably guessed I would
argue that the policy of sales tax on foodstuff
is entirely inconsistent because there is no
exemption in the case of that good wholesome food, margarine.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I speak quite seriously
because margarine is now a recognized food
product in this country, and is a great boon
to Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The only reason it does
not appear here is that when the list was
prepared no such commodity as margarine
was manufactured or sold in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is still no such
product in some of our provinces.

respect to disabilities that were incurred
during the service of the veteran concerned,
and irrespective of whether they were or
were not attributable to, or the result of, such
service. As the act now stands, the benefits
are available to three classes of veterans,
namely, those whose service involved duties
required to be performed outside of the
western hemisphere, those who served only
in the western hemisphere but for more than
twelve months, and, lastly, those who served
anywhere for even less than twelve months
but who are in receipt of a pension for a
disability incurred as a result of such service.
This bill, in section 1, extends the last class
by providing that the disability need not have
been incurred as a result of service if it did,
in fact, occur during service.
Honourable senators are aware that a
fundamental principle of the Act is that lands
be made available to veterans on the basis
of the cost of such lands to the director. This
is a sound principle, and it has been followed by the administration over the years
as closely as possible, but there are cases
where it is difficult for the director to determine the actual cost to him of certain properties. An example would be where the director
has received title to property at a nominal
price, or where the director, after having
acquired title to a large block of land, has
disposed of parts of it, and the remaining
part has to be valued for settlement purposes.
It is intended that the director have power to
place a proper value on these lands, but that
it cannot be in any case less than the amount
that has been actually expended therefor.
Certain problems which are now confronting the administration and which, perhaps,
could not have been visualized at the time the
Act was passed, are dealt with in the proposed
new section 9A. It may be noted that there is
at present in the Act no provision to take care
of a situation where a veteran who has
already been established under a land contract finds that for some good reason it is
necessary for him to take up his residence in
another locality-often, another province.
Sometimes it would be of benefit to the
veteran and to the director to sell part of the
property under contract; but that cannot be
done in the usual way. This bill provides for
a substitution of the land by some other land,
and for the sale of part of the land and
application of the proceeds to the purchase
of other lands, or to effecting improvement
on the remaining land, or to reducing the
amount owing under the contract, or to reducing the cost to the director. It also provides
that, where property under contract to a
veteran is being expropriated by the Crown,
the transaction can be regarded as an ordinary
45785-28J

sale of the property concerned and the compensation can be used as in the case of a sale.
As a safeguard against successive substitutions of land in the contract, the bill provides
that substitution can take place only once.
As honourable senators are aware, machinery is provided in the Act to terminate contracts of veterans who may be in default
after their cases have been considered by the
appropriate provincial Advisory Board. It
sometimes happens that a veteran is ready
to dispense with this formal procedure and
give a quit claim deed to the director for his
interest in the land. The bill authorizes the
director to take such a release without having to go through formal termination proceedings. As the Act now stands, the
director has authority to dispose of lands that
have reverted to him by rescission of contracts. It is believed that in the interest of
good administration the director ought to
have authority to sell any lands that he may
own, for cash, at a price not less than the
cost of the property to him.
The bill also provides, in new section 19,
for the disposition of any surplus that may
arise from the release of any property by the
director. In such a case, in order to determine the amount of any surplus there may
be, it is necessary to examine the old contract and ascertain what was owing by the
veteran at the time the contract was cancelled, and then add to that amount the various amounts which are set out in paragraphs
(b) to (e) of subsection (2) of section 19.
These together will set out the debt owing
on that land, but credit will be given against
the amount for any income derived by the
director since the termination of the agreement. The balance will then be the figure
which will be used in making adjustments
between the first veteran and the second
veteran, or a civilian purchaser, on the resale
of the property.
At present, where land has been sold pursuant to section 21 at less than its actual cost
and it becomes necessary to accept prepayment before ten years have expired, the
director is required to collect the full amount
of the original cost and not the price at
which it was sold. That works a hardship
on veterans who purchased properties at a
price that was determined after the writingoff of certain exorbitant costs which occurred
during the first year or two of building construction. The bill provides that in the case
of resale only the "written down" price is to
be taken into consideration in adjusting
accounts.
Honourable senators will remember that iu
the early days of construction considerable
additional costs crept into the final cost of a

constantly changing economic conditions.

In

order to deal fairly with veterans the government, under section 21 of the Act, authorized the appraisal and sale of such properties
at prices that in most cases were considerably
less than actual cost. The bill confirms that
policy.
During the course of administration it bas
been found that many veterans have-paid substantial amounts in excess of the property value
at which the director could deal with them.
For example, a veteran might have made a
substantial payment of his own money at the
time the property was purchased, or for
various reasons he might have had a sizeable
interest in the property before he approached
the Veterans' Land Administration for the
benefits under the Act. The new section 23A
is designed to enable the director to release
to the veteran, in proper cases, part of the
property covered by the sale contract where
the remaining property would have been
sufficient at the time of the contract to warrant the financial assistance then given. In
other words, it concerns property that was
surplus to the security requirements of the
Act at the time the debt was created. The
bill will allow a veteran to secure title from
the director of such property if the director
believes that he can safely convey it to him
as being surplus to the security requirements
at the time the financial assistance was given.
A great many veterans have become settled
on lands owned by the western provinces.
In those cases they were able to obtain certain financial assistance from the director
under the Veterans' Land Act. The bill provides that such settlers can give up their
settlement rights on provincial lands and
become settled on lands owned by the director if they are prepared to repay to the
director any expenditures already made for
them undýer the Act. Likewise, veterans who
are settled in the ordinary way on lands
owned by the director may give up those
lands and take advantage of settlement
opportunities on provincial lands if they
repay to the director any expenditures
already made on their behalf.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

EMERGENCY GOLD MINING
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 219, an Act to amend the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to handle this
bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to amend an Act which was
passed in 1948 with, I think I can say, the
general approval of honourable members of
both houses. The basis for that Act was the
recognition that the cost of producing gold
had greatly increased and that the selling
prices were fixed. The purpose behind the
legislation passed was to provide assistance
to gold mines during the years 1948, 1949
and 1950.
The Act provided a rate of assistance of
one-half the amount by which a mine's average cost of producing an ounce of gold
Total assistance, however,
exceeded $18.
could not exceed $16 per ounce produced.
In the case of old mines, the Act provides
for payment on the amount by which the
gold produced and sold in a designated year
exceeded two-thirds of the gold produced in
the base year. The base year in most cases
was the 12-month period ending June 30,
1947.
With reference to new mines, payment
was made on the entire production in the
first year of production, which, in this case,
became

its

base

year.

Payment

to

new

mines, after the first year of production, was
based on the amount by which the gold
produced and sold in a designated year
exceeded two-thirds of the first year's
production.
Before I deal with the amendments contained in the bill, may I digress for a
moment to tell the house how this arrangement works out? I should point out that
the report on administration of the Act for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1949 shows
that assistance payments actually made up
to the end of April 1949, in respect of the
designated year 1948, amounted to $7,593,516.12. The assistance per ounce of gold
produced and sold in the year 1948 amounted
to $3.20. It may be noted from the report
that five mines produced gold at a cost of
between $18 and $25 per ounce; thirty-six
between $25 and $35 per ounce; and fortysix at more than $35 per ounce.

DECEMBER S, 1949
Information is not yet complete as to the
total amount of assistance payable for the
year 1948. The auditing of the books of
accounts and records of some mines has not
been finished. The usual practice is to make
an advance payment of 80 per cent on
account of what may be coming to the mines
not qualified. Of 104 mines which, up to
September 30, have made application for
assistance in respect of 1948, information is
available for only 64.
I have before me a detailed statement as
of September 30 this year, which, with the
permission of the Senate, I should like to
put on the record. This statement shows
the amounts of assistance payable, and the
number of ounces of gold produced and sold
by Canadian gold mining operators in the
designated year 1948, as compiled up to
September 30, 1949. It shows that assistance payments made up to this date, with
respect to 1948, amount to $9,597,010.82. The
total amount of assistance payable on the
basis of applications received amounted to
This total amount payable
$10,116,271.89.
relates to 3,143,789.270 ounces of gold produced and sold in 1948, and the average
assistance payable per ounce is $3.12.
(See Appendix A at end of today's report.)
Not until next year will it be possible to
give information on the total amount of
assistance paid under the Act in respect of
gold produced and sold in the designated
year of 1949.
I have on my desk another statement which,
with the permission of the house, I should
also like to place on Hansard. This shows
particulars of assistance payments which
have been made during the first nine months
of 1949. These payments are in the form
of advances up to 80 per cent, as permitted
by the regulations made under the Act. The
statement shows that the total assistance
payments payable to 63 mines, as of the
amounted to
end of last September,
$4,728,349.39, which is an average of $3.89
per ounce of gold produced and sold.
(See Appendix B at end of today's report.)
When complete information is available
for the year 1949 the average rate of assistance will be less than the average amount
paid to date, because, presumably, mines
entitled to receive a high rate of assistance
are the first to make application and to
receive payments on account. The expectation is, however, that the total amount of
assistance payable for the designated year
1949-and the information will not be complete until about the end of 1950-will be
approximately $14 million. This means that

about $24 million will have been dispersed by
the government in respect of the first two
designated years under the Emergency Gold
Mining Assistance Act.
It is scarcely necessary for me to say that
these payments have been of great assistance,
and have kept in operation gold mines which
were on a marginal basis. These mines have
continued to operate with some measure of
success; they have maintained, and in some
cases increased, employment and earnings.
In this way other industries dependent on the
successful operation of the gold mines have
continued their activities. In the mining
areas there are towns and agricultural communities which, for the measure of prosperity
which they enjoy, are entirely dependent on
the operation of the mines.
I now come to the provisions of the bill.
Shortly after the passage of the Act it became
apparent that certain amendments should
be made. Some of these amendments are
contained in the bill now before the house.
There was found to be a relatively small
number of mines, which, for one reason or
another beyond their control, were obliged to
reduce the amount of gold formerly produced
by them, and for which the Act failed to
provide needed assistance.
Honourable senators will recall that new
mines receive assistance in respect of their
production for the first year of operation,
and in the succeeding year received assistance
on the basis of the amount by which that
year's production exceeded two-thirds of the
production during the first year; and that
old mines received assistance on the basis
of their production in excess of two-thirds of
their production for the base period. The Act
did not contemplate the situation of a mine
which, because of conditions beyond its control, reduced its production instead of
increasing it. May I give an illustration of
what I mean? There may be two, three or
four mines in a locality, all using the facilities
of one mill. The quantity of ore going through
this mill would be fixed by the agreement
of the various properties supplying ore to
that mill. There is no way in which the
tonnage to be delivered to the mill by any
property could be increased, unless one of
the other properties decreased its tonnage.
One must remember that some of the older
properties are petering out, and the tonnage
is decreasing. In these circumstances no
assistance would be afforded to the mines
under the provisions of the Act as originally
passed. This bill would give relief to such
mines by rendering assistance on the basis of
one-third of their production.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.

ment under this Act with respect to assistance to be extended in the future, in view of
the devaluation of the Canadian dollar in
terms of the American dollar. I have just
answered a question on that point by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), and there is a section in the
bill before us which deals with it. It is proposed during the designated year 1950 to
reduce the total amount of assistance payments made to any mine by an amount equal
to $3.50 an ounce for each ounce of gold to
which the rate of assistance under the present
Act applies. This in effect means that any
mine whose rate of assistance during 1950
is $3.50 per ounce or less will receive nothing;
and those mines whose rates of assistance
are more than $3.50 an ounce will receive
the difference between $3.50 and the amount
to which they would be entitled under the
present Act.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That should reduce the
payments considerably, should it not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I expect it will. I believe
the average of the payments per ounce in
1948 was $3.22, and it was estimated that the
amount in 1949 might be as high as $3.89, but
it may be even lower than that. But these
are only averages: undoubtedly some mines
will qualify for a fairly substantial additional
payment.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But a mine not qualifying
for any assistance would get the $3.50?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. The only mines
which will qualify under the Act will be
those that will qualify for a rate of assistance
in excess of the amount of the premium on
gold as a result of devaluation. It may well
be that the year 1950 will mark a very substantial decrease in the amount of payments
under this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read a second time.

AMENDMENTS

The Senate proceeded to consideration of

He said: Honourable senators, these amendments, which are printed in our Minutes of
Proceedings and in the Votes and Proceedings of another house, have been sent back to
us by that house for concurrence. I may say
that the department is quite agreeable to the
amendments, but I am not in a position to
explain them to the house in any detail. Many
of them are of a minor nature; but if honourable senators are not ready to concur in
them, I would ask that they be referred to
one of our committees, where they could be
considered individually.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Are there any material
changes?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The amendments
appear at page 286 of our Minutes of Proceedings and, as I have said, are quite agreeable to the department.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
one of those in this house who is extremely
anxious to get this bill through. It will certainly assist the business interests of this
country. I do not want to see it back on our
doorstep a year from now, because this is
the third session in a row that we have dealt
with it. If the bill were referred to committee, there would undoubtedly be those who
would be desirous of making further changes,
and I personally would like to see these
amendments concurred in now.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 10, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code-(Hon. Mr. Haig).

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, there
is a mistake here. This order should appear
not in my name but in that of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
I may say that I did read the bill through and
get the necessary material ready. Last night
after we adjourned I went to another place to
listen to the debate, and while I was there a
messenger came to me and said that the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) wanted me to explain the bill
today. This was most unusual, and I said to
him that there must be some mistake. He
replied, "No, we have to have it, because we
want to print it". I said, "All right, but I am
not going to leave here; I want to listen to the
debate". This morning I went up to the room
of the honourable senator from Toronto to
discuss the bill with him, and he said, "I am
explaining that bill". I would therefore ask
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to handle this bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, for its size
this bill has had more publicity across Canada
than any other legislation during this session
except, possibly, the Combines Investigation
Act. For its size the bill seeks to accomplish
an important job. It attempts to deal in
general terms with the publication and distribution of what are called "crime comics" or
"crimics"-a newly coined word which is
quite a corruption of the two words, but
which I think might become a part of our
dictionary in the near future.
In its present form the bill simply amends
section 207 of the Criminal Code. The amendment involves the repeal of the present
section, and its re-enactment with some
omissions and some slight changes in order.
If honourable senators compare paragraph
1 of section 207 of the proposed amendment
with the first paragraph of the present Act,
they will see that these paragraphs are
practically the same, except that the words
"knowingly, without lawful justification or
excuse" have been left out of the amendment. The reason for this is that representations have been made by various provincial
attorneys-general, to the effect that the
general application of these words has made
prosecution under this section a very difficult
task. It was felt that it was logical to take
these words out of the first part of section
207, because the section deals with everyone

who "makes, prints, publishes, distributes,
circulates, or has in possession . . ."

It was

considered that these are matters a person
would know about, and therefore these words
"knowingly, without lawful justification or
excuse" should not enter into the question of
essential proof by the Crown. So it will no
longer be ncecssary for the prosecution to
prove knowledge on the part of an accused
charged under section 207 (1) (a).
Then clause (b) has been added to this
subsection to deal with crime comics. It
reads:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to two years' imprisonment who
(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or
has in possession for any such purpose, any crime
comic.

For a definition of "crime comic" one looks
to subsection 3:
"Crime comic" means in this section any magazine, periodical or book which exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially the
commission of crimes, real or fictitious.

It will be noticed that the subsequent provisions of section 207 deal with the matter
of proof and the function of a judge. Subsection 4 says:
No one shall be convicted of any offence in this
section mentioned if be proves that the public
good was served by the acts alleged to have been
done, and that there was no excess in the acts
alleged beyond what the public good required.

That subsection is already in the Code as

subsection 2 of section 207.
There has
simply been a change in its order, so as to
make it applicable as well to the newly
created offence of making, printing, publishing, distributing, selling or possessing any
crime comic.
Subsection 5 says:
It shall be a question for the judge whether
such acts are such as might be for the public good,
and whether there is evidence of excess beyond
what the public good required; but it shall be a
question for the jury whether there is or is not such
excess.

The judge has to determine in

the first

instance whether there is evidence of excess,

but even if he rules that there is, it is for
the jury to find whether in fact there is or
is not such excess. I should point out that
this subsection is already a part of section
207, and that merely its position in the section
has been changed.
Subsection 6 provides:
The motives of the accused shall in ail cases be
irrelevant.

That subsection also is in the present
section 207, but as subsection 4.
Subsection 7 is new. It reads:
It shall be no defence to a charge under subsection one that the accused was ignorant of the
nature or presence of the matter, picture, model,
crime comic or other thing.

DECEMBER 6, 1949
That is to say, any one charged with making, printing, publishing, distributing, circulating or having in his possession any
obscene written matter, picture, model or
other thing, or any one charged with making,
printing, publishing, distributing, selling or
possessing any crime comie, will not be able
to plead that he was ignorant of the nature
or presence of the matter, picture, model,
crime comic, and so forth.
In dealing with subsection (1) (b) of section
207 I think that undoubtedly some consideration must be given to the injurious effect
which crime comics may have upon the growing generation. While I am not one to advocate any great extensions of paternalism in
government, nor one who could support particular censorship of a particular thing, I
feel that by enacting these general provisions
which create an offence, yet leaving it to the
court in each case to decide whether or not
the offence has been committed, parliament
will have dealt with the matter in as broad
and general a way as is practicable. I am
not able to say whether many people are
likely to be convicted of the new offence, but
I should think the mere fact that section 207
is one under which few people would care
to find themselves convicted-a section dealing with obscenities in books, pictures and
models-might have the effect of reducing
the number of crime comics offered for sale.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I have nothing to add to the discussion on
the legal points, but I wish to say a word or
two about the origin of this measure. When
a bill or any new matter comes before us I
always wonder how it happened to be introduced, and I made it my business to inquire
what caused a young member of the other
house to bring in this one. He told me that
about three years ago the secretary of a
teachers' federation in British Columbia wrote
to him complaining about the effect of crime
comics on children in the district which the
federation represented, and asking if he
would take up the matter. He went on to
say-if I may quote his words-"Well, I
thought that probably some cranks had got
into the teaching profession, but I wrote them
a polite letter saying that I would consider
their complaint, though honestly I felt there
was not much I could do about it. But not
long afterwards the secretary sent me copies
of some crime comics, and when I saw them
I just went up in the air".
However, he moved deliberately and carefully. He drew the matter to the attention
of the then Minister of Justice, now the Right
Honourable Mr. Justice Ilsley of the Nova
Scotia Supreme Court, who expressed the
opinion that there was a good deal in the

teachers' complaint, and more or less
encouraged the young honourable member to
pursue the matter.
The sponsor first introduced his bill last
session, but there was not time to deal with
it before dissolution of parliament. He admitted to me that in any event that bill would
not have succeeded in accomplishing the
desired object, because he had worked it in
accordance with the present section 207 of the
Code, under which it has been necessary to
prove that the accused acted knowingly.
However, such general approval of the bill
was expressed in the Commons that the
Minister of Justice wrote to the Attorneys
General of the provinces and asked their
opinion of the bill. All approved of it, except
the Attorney General of Ontario, who said
he wished further time to consider it. Then
this bill was drafted. It was said in the other
house that if the original bill had been passed
no provincial Attorney General would have
prosecuted under it, for the record shows
that the necessity of proving knowledge on
the part of the accused has made it extremely
difficult to obtain convictions under section
207 in the past.
The chairman of one of the committees
of the American Bar Association is keeping
a close eye on what parliament is doing with
this bill and is seriously recommending that
similar legislation be enacted in the United
States. So far, however, no step along the
line of this bill has been taken over there.
I do not think there will be many convictions under this amended section 207, because,
as was suggested by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) it probably
will not be necessary to prosecute many
people under it. A news-dealer who consults
his lawyer may be advised that an offender
would stand a good chance of escaping conviction, but public opinion among Canadians
-I am thinking not of cranks, but of people
in all walks of life, including members of
religious and educational organizations-has
been practically unanimous in support of
some such legislation as this, and I feel that
few news-dealers would care to carry on
business in defiance of so strong a public
opinion. If a school teacher could not judge
the effect of such literature, I do not know
who could.
I am very happy to support the bill, and I
am pleased that a young man in the house of
CommonsHon. Mr. Moraud: In the other place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -took the time, in spite
of much discussion about our problems of
finance, the marketing of our goods and conditions in Europe, to consider legislation for
the benefit of the youth of this country.

SENATE
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I wish to say a few words about this bill.
I think we are all agreed on the desirability
of the target aimed at. The ordinary crime
comic book is a degrading thing, if it actually
depicts the commission of a crime.
After seeing the play Othello not long ago,
I decided that I would never again go to see
it because it depicts the commission of crimes
on the stage. There is the murder of a woman
right in front of the audience, and several
other crimes of a most revolting nature. It
occurred to me that such a drama dulls the
keen edge of the conscience of one who is
susceptible to looking at that sort of thing.
That is Shakespeare, and I do not suppose
this measure would go so far as to ban
Othello.

The describing of the commission of a crime
in print is objectionable. But this is new
legislation and we have had very little discussion about it. Only a very short time
elapsed between the passing of the bill in the
House of Commons and the consideration of
it here today. The drafting of the bill is open
to some question, but I am ready to vote for
second reading provided the bill is sent to a
committee. Within the past half hour I have
had a telephone message from Toronto to
the effect that certain publishers desire to
say something to us before we pass this bill.

Those persons, or their representative, can
be here tomorrow or the next day.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is a meeting of
the Banking and Commerce Committee
tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very wefl, I will reply
to them that we will hear what they have to
say tomorrow morning.
There has been, of course, a good deal of
general discussion in times gone by about
crime comics and crime stories of all kinds.
The paper-covered novel of the cheaper type
has perhaps done a great deal of damage to
young people and older persons too. I do not
like this type of literature, but I must recognize that we have never before legislated in
this regard. I say we should go carefully,
and by that I do not mean that we should go
slowly. I should be very pleased if this bill
were referred to a committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

when a bill is reported without amendment
it is not necessary to have a motion for

motion, and then it is in order to move third
reading, unless someone objects.
Hon. Mr. Marcote: I do not think that has
been our practice, and I should like to have
a ruling on it. A committee simply reports
a bill and has no authority to say that the
report shall be adopted.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say it had. I said
that if a committee reports a bill without

be made.

MOTION FOR THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Now.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, this bill was considered in committee this morning, and the house has now
approved of the report of the committee without any amendment.
The bill has made
rapid progress, with very little representation
from those most directly affected. Certain
amendments were made to it in the other
house on Monday, it came before this house
on Wednesday, and we are now asked to
pass it and make it law.
The bill contains one very drastic provision to which I should like to draw the attention of the house. It is contained in paragraph (b) of clause 207 (1), which appears on
the first page of the bill and reads as follows:
Everyone

. . .

who

(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or
has in possession for any such purpose, any crime
comie.

Honourable senators will observe that this
clause applies not only to manufacturers but
also to wholesalers and retail distributors of
comie books and other such literature.
According to the evidence heard in committee
this morning there are in Canada some
10,000 retail outlets for comics, and the
number of publications of a similar character
is very large. The bill throws upon the
shoulders of every manufacturer, distributor,
wholesaler and small retailer, equally, the
obligation of reading al the material in these
magazines, books and periodicals, and of
deciding whether or not they are crime
comics-which is to a great extent undefined

-and are in a way exercising an evil influence upon the public. This bill would make
every small retailer a censor of what the
public reads. Further, it would place an
absolute responsibility on the retailer, for
instance, to examine every page in every
magazine which passes through his hands.
This is an utter physical impossibility.
The manufacturer is in a somewhat different position. Honourable members will appreciate that all the magazines and periodicals
which might be described in the words of
this bill as crime comics are manufactured
in Canada, and are not imported from the
United States. There is a considerable industry in Canada producing these publications.
It distributes, we are told, about 40 million
books of this kind per year, and employs a
large number of people. It is an important
industry to this country.
But more important still is the very large
number of people who read these books, for
they are read not only by the youth of the
country, but to a considerable extent by
adults. So we are dealing with something
which has a serious implication.
I take it that we desire to suppress publications which are vicious and which corrupt morals or lead youth astray, but that
we are not anxious to suppress those which
have the contrary effect. On those principles,
I assume, the house is unanimous. But above
all things we have no desire unnecessarily
to destroy an industry or to embarrass the
retail sellers of these publications. So I suggest that, as the manufacturer is the source
of these publications-for he gets from the
United States the plates from which he prints
them-and as he bas ample time and opportunity to inspect the plates or read the early
proofs and consider whether their contents
contravene the law, it is upon the manufacturer's shoulders that the full burden should
rest. Let him be the censor of what, in this
particular, Canadians should be allowed to
read, and if he fails in his guess let the
responsibility be his.
But I do think that we should have some
consideration for the retailer, to whom these
and other periodicals are shipped in great
quantities and not hold him responsible for
everything that passes through his hands
whether he knows about it or not. Such a
course is unnecessary because, as I have said,
the government can completely control the
source of all these periodicals. I understand
that none are brought in from the United
States; but if any of the description I have
mentioned are imported, they must pass the
Customs Department, where a censorship
now exists or could soon be arranged for. It

SENATE
follows that the issue before us is not as to
imported matter, but as to publications manufactured domestically.
I propose, honourable senators, an amendment of section 207, subsection (1) (b), reading
as follows:
(b) makes, prints, publishes, or has in his possession or knowingly distributes or selIs, any crime
comic.
The purpose of my amendment is to put
the burden solely on the shoulders of the
manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I believe the honourable
senator is not in order. He should first move
that the house go into Committee of the
Whole.
The Hon. the Speaker: I was about to say
for the information of the honourable senator,
that unless he is merely explaining what he
has in mind as to the wording of an amendment, he should first move that this bill be not
read the third time, but that it be committed
for consideration to the Committee of the
Whole.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I so move.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is now on the motion of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a word. I listened to
the honourable gentleman's explanation of
why he wants the bill amended. It would
not be amiss to give a brief history of this
bill. One of the private members of the
House of Commons introduced a bill, to
amend the Code by adding a section which
he thought would prohibit the publication
and sale of crime comics. We were informed
in committee this morning that about 12 per
cent of the literature distributed in the newsstands comes under this category. I do not
know whether that figure is right, but I shall
accept it.
When the bill which had been introduced
by a private member in another place came
up for second reading, the Minister of Justice
said that he agreed with the principle of
prohibiting the publication, sale and distribution of crime comics, but that he did not
feel that the bill before the house would
accomplish that end. He stated that if this
section of the Criminal Code was to be
amended, it should be altered in such fashion
that its provisions could be enforced. The
words "knowingly, without loss of justification or excuse" were to be taken out of the
Act, and the minister said that he would consult the Attorneys General of the various
provinces, because they were the ones who
would have to enforce the law.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: That was in October.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and the minister quite
properly consulted the Attorneys General,
and the only one who hesitated and said that
his province wanted to consider the matter
further, was the Attorney General of Ontario.
The various other Attorneys General agreed
that if anybody were guilty of publishing
and distributing crime comics, they should
be convicted without the Crown having to
prove that the publisher distributed the
literature "knowingly". This bas been the
defence used in the past, making it difficult
for the Crown to get convictions. Pursuant
to consultation with the Attorneys General,
the minister drafted the present bill and
introduced it in the other place as a government measure.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Minister of Justice
introduced it, and it is a government bill.
The bill introduced by the honourable member from Kamloops (Mr. Fulton) was No. 9;
this bill is No. 10. This bill was substituted
for the original bill when it was before
committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is a public bill, but
not a government bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What I meant was that it
is not a private bill. The Minister of Justice
appeared before our committee this morning;
and in clear and plain language he said that
he wanted this legislation, and that it complied with the wishes of the Attorneys
General. If we want to give the law officers
of this country power to prohibit the publication and distribution of crime comics and
salacious literature, we have got to give them
this legislation. We must not forget that it is
the courts who enforce the law. My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) claims that the distributors will
be forced into trouble, but I do not think so.
Perhaps, by their own estimate, they will lose
12 per cent of the magazines they now sell,
but more than likely they will sell other
magazines instead.
I have read newspapers from all across
Canada, and I have found no editorial which
opposes this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: They are all for it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, every Canadian newspaper is for it. This bill has no political significance, and if we find in three or four years
that we have been wrong-parliament has
been wrong before-we can amend the law.
I usually get from five to twenty-five letters
of complaint from all over Canada on any
other measure that affects the public at large,

Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable senators, first I wish to comrnend the young representative of Karnloops in another house upon
introducing this bil into parliament. The
bill first presented was, I have been told, a
private bill, and while it met with approvai
of the whoie house, there was flot time to
pass it before the session ended. Then il was
amended to, give it some teeth and was
brought in this session as a public bill. It is
the teeth that are causing some trouble, for
sellers and distributors of crime comnics were
flot affected by the original bill, but are liable
under this one.
The Senate of course has a perfect right to
examine the bill and pass whatever judgment
it wishes upon it, but I believe the bill wili

the country. I corne to this chamber from

Hon. Mr. Haig: No. No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend has imputed
to me the motive that I come from the city
of Toronto and desire to defend an industry
of that city. That, by the way, is a laudable
desire, and not otherwise. I am therefore
free, I think, to define the reasons for my
friend's action, in somewhat the same way
that he has defined the reasons for my
attitude. However, we will drop that phase
of the discussion.
The position of the leader opposite is that
he wants a person to be subject to criminal
prosecution for doing something that he did
not know he was doing.
I think the argument applies to some extent
at least to the publisher of crime comics;
but he is in a position to know what he
is doing, and if he is vigilant he can read
the articles in the quiet of his own office and
determine whether or not they contravene
the law.
I am perfectly satisfied that the teeth to
which the leader opposite has referred shall
remain in the bill as drafted, but I do not
want this law to be like a mad dog which
is running around biting everybody in my
friend's province as well as in mine. Under
this bill, every distributor who had sent
to him a bundle of these magazines several
feet high, would be required to read them
all through to determine whether or not
there was anything in them which contravened the provisions of the bill. That is
ridiculous, or it is something which he cannot possibly do. It is an injustice to put
that responsibility on his shoulders, and it
is a greater injustice to hold him criminally
liable for failing to discharge that responsibility.
If the bill is amended as I propose, it will
still have the same teeth it had as originally
drafted, but it will not victimize every little
retailer in the country who happens to be
selling the article.
My friend the leader opposite says that
this bill has been approved by teachers and
other good people of this country. I have no
doubt that they have approved it in principle,
as I do. But members of the teachers' association and the ministerial associations are
not members of this house, and did not draft
the bill. Certainly I have no desire that

the young people of this country be demoralized through the reading of bad literature.
We are all agreed on the general principle of
the bill, but we are under no obligation to
follow the words of the measure as drafted;
indeed, there is a personal responsibility on
each of us to discharge that obligation in
the way that we see wise and fit. We should
not take anything handed to us on a spoon
and meekly swallow it.
My proposed amendment to paragraph (b)
of section 207 (1), places the responsibility
upon the shoulders of those who print and
publish crime comics. Is that not enough?
My friend says it is difficult to enforce legislation of this kind. I know it is, but do my
proposed amendments make it any more
difficult to obtain a conviction? I have confined the responsibility to the publishers, of
whom there are not more than a half a dozen
in Canada. As soon as anyone buys a copy
of a comie publication he can quickly trace
it back, through the distributor, to the
producer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Where are these manufacturers now located?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not certain about
all of them. I know that several are in the
city of Toronto. I am sorry that one at least
is not located in Winnipeg so that my friend
would be on my side.
Hon. Mr. Haiû: Please do not engage in that
type of discussion.
If a crime comic publication is distributed
in Manitoba, what can the Attorney-General
of that province do to a distributor who may
live in Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He can ask the AttorneyGeneral of Ontario to institute a prosecution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the Attorney-General for
Ontario says he does not know about such
a publication, what then happens?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Attorney-General
of Manitoba can send somebody to Ontario
to institute a prosecution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no control.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The senator who is
chairman of this Committee of the Whole
asked whether any citizen could institute a
criminal prosecution such as envisaged by
this bill? The answer is that he can, in the
same way that he may lay a charge for any
other infraction of the Criminal Code. Ali
a private citizen has to do in order to institute
a prosecution is to go before a magistrate
and lay an information.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But suppose the AttorneyGeneral refuses to prosecute, what happens
then?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A private citizen, to
prosecute under this bill, does not have to
ask for approval of the Attorney-General;
he need only go before a magistrate and lay
an information.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This is an amendment to
the code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend, who is a
lawyer, surely knows that one does not have
to ask the consent of the Attorney-General
to launch a prosecution under the Criminal
Code.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Only a few prosecutions
require the consent of the Attorney-General,
where consent is required it is so stated in
the code. A private citizen can of his own
will and determination institute a prosecution
under the great majority of the sections of the
Criminal Code, and I think that a magistrate
may not refuse to take an information when
a citizen comes before him to lay it.
So anybody in the province of Ontario who
has some knowledge of the facts-he does
not even need to be a resident-can lay the
charge, and the processes of the courts are
put in motion. If some of the manufacturers
are located in Montreal the complaint can
be made in that province. The police will
trace the matter and find out who manufactured and published the objectionable
material: the complainant can then lay his
charge, and if the party is outside the law
you "have him cold." Under these circumstances there is no ground for my honourable
friend's complaint about "pulling the teeth"
of this measure. The teeth remain, but they
bite the proper person and not the wrong
one.
On the other hand, consider what would
happen if the bill as it stands were passed.
Assuming that a retailer in the province of
Manitoba-where everybody wears a halobas had shipped to him some of this material
from a printer and publisher in the city of
Toronto-where, according to my honourable
friend from Winnipeg, all the people are
very bad-and that this retailer, without
thoroughly reading the material, or after
reading it, guesses wrong as to whether it
is subversive or not subversive and puts it on
sale, what then? My friend would have
him haled before a magistrate, convicted
under this section of a crime which he did
not know he was committing, and made
liable to two years in jail. I say that such
a provision is drastic, excessive and wrong;
that it will not meet with public approval,
and should not be entertained by this house.

Hon. Mr. Moraud: May I ask my honourable friend whether two years in jail is not
the maximum penalty.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: The penalty might be
only a fine.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It might be a fine. But
there is no stipulation that it must be a fine,
and there is no limit to the amount.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I suggest, if the honourable senator's reasoning is sound, that in
the days of prohibition all the authorities
needed to have done was to go after the
manufacturer. According to my honourable
friend's theory, that would have settled the
matter. The manufacturer would have been
punished instead of the man who had the
liquor. But that was never done, as far as
I know.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are about half a
dozen presses in Canada that print these
publications. Liquor, as the honourable
senator knows, might be distilled behind any
hill in his own province. In such a case
you could not reach the manufacturer. In
this case you can. That is the distinction.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You could reach him in
the other case, too.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Furthermore, this matter has been running along for quite a long
time, and it is not now necessary that we
jump too fast and too far. If the law as it
stands is put into effect without my amendment, what will be accomplished. Every
distributor in every retail store that handles
material of this kind will be frightened to
the point that he will refuse to handle any
of it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And a good thing too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend may not read
the comics; perhaps he is past the age at
which they appeal. But I can tell him that
a very large proportion of the population
of Canada does read comics.
Hon. Mr. Horner: To judge by the way
they act sometimes, I can believe it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is all very well,
but these are the conditions under which
we live. I do not know that there is anything wrong in a "comic" as such, but whether
it be objectionable or not, neither my friend
nor I nor any member of this chamber can
suppress a phenomenon which is part of our

DECEMBER 7. 1949
age. At the committee meeting this morning we were shown a crime comie published
to promote the sale of government bonds,
and bearing the name of the Bank of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: A little sugar with the
poison!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That may be so, but
it was a comie; and not only was it a comic,
but a crime comic-and used by a department of government for the purpose of
selling bonds.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That shows how depraved
we are.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That may be so. But
I am instancing this to show how widespread
is the public demand for comics. Anyone who
has children or young people in his house
knows that the very first thing they turn to
when the papers come in are the comics. You
gentlemen who are past the meridian of life
may regard that addiction as very frivolous,
but it is human nature as exemplified in the
population among which we live.
I repeat, that to pass a drastie measure of
this kind, and to so alarm our retailers as to
deter them from handling any of these
goods, whether good, bad or indifferent, is
not the kind of legislation which this Senate
should endorse. We should attach the stigma
of crime only to those who know they are
committing a crime or, if they do not know
it, should know it. Will anybody here suggest that the operators of every one of the
ten thousand retail stores which handle goods
of this kind should be foreed to read every
page that they sell, and be held responsible
for every page? My friend may amend the
bill to make it more drastic if he feels that
that course does not violate any British principle, and if he makes it applicable to those
who produce and publish this material, I will
vote for it; but I will not vote to "ride" the
little retailer all over the Dominion of Canada.
As the Minister of Justice said in the other
place, whaf concerned him was the position
of the small retaller; and it is the retailer's
fate under drastic legislation of this nature
with which I, too, am concerned.
The Hon. the Chairman: I did not like to
interrupt the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), but I
should like to have his amendment formally
before the committee. He has made a motion,
but it is not before me in writing. I suggest
that he let me have it, and that it should
have a seconder before the debate is
proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I have just a few words
to say on this matter. I am wholeheartedly
in favour of the bill. One complaint has

reached me from the father of two sons, who
says that these publications are about all you
can get boys to read nowadays.
I intend to support this amendment, but
from a standpoint entirely different from that
of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). In the committee this morning I asked to have read the
names of the publishers of these comics, and
I was astonished to find that I know very
well and intimately the principals of three of
these publishing companies. These men are
just as good people as we are, just as sincere,
honest, Christian, church-going people, and
no one is going to tell me that they are
interested in doing anything which will
create or encourage juvenile delinquency.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The statement was not that
these people printed "crime comics", but that
they printed "comics".
Hon. Mr. Davies: I understood the witness
to say "crime comics".
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I think he did. He held
up one or two magazines that they were
printing.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The question asked in
committee was whether they were "comics",
not "crime comics".
Hon. Mr. Haig: And the two firms he mentioned are dropping them.
Hon. Mr. Davies: What I have reference to
is the statement that one publisher was printing one, and another two, crime comics. They
call them crime comics; whether they are or
not I do not know.
I am supporting the amendment with one
object in mind: Let us give these publishers
the chance to "clean house" and I do not
think we shall have any more trouble about
comics. We should say that every person
who "makes, prints, publishes, distributes,
circulates, or bas in possession for any such
purpose any obscene written matter, picture,
model or other thing whatsoever" should be
prosecuted. I do not think we would have any
more trouble if this were done. These men
have big printing and publishing establishments, and they probably do not know every
detail of their business. I am quite sure that
if we gave them an opportunity to clean
house, these things would not be circulated
among the retailers and the news vendors on
the street corners of Toronto, Kingston and
other cities where there is a large sale of
them.
I did not vote for the amendment in committee this morning, but for the reason I have

SENATE

outlined I am going to vote for this anendment. I should like to see the whole onus
placed on the publisher; but first let the
publisher have an opportunity to clean house.

Some years ago Canada decided to spend

people, than in protecting a literature that
is imported, 100 per cent, from a foreign
country.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: Honourable senators, in
discussing this amendment we must bear
in mind what was said in committee this
muorning. All the publishers of these crime
comics are centred in Toronto or vicinity.
If the amendment proposed by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) were adopted, the only people who
in future could possibly be prosecuted under
,hi- law would be the publishers.
The
rinister stated this morning that in October,
when this bill came before another house,
he told that house that this bill would be
made a public bill. The people of this
country had ample time to study the matter
and to make representations, but they did not
do so. The bill was passed in its present
form after consultations between the minister and the Attorneys General of the provinces. Therefore, this bill not only comes
ho us with the approval of another place
but with the approbation of the Attorney
General of every province except Ontario.
The Ontario Attorney General did not
disapprove; he only said that he wanted to
consider it further.
Honourable senators, if we accept the
amendment before us, we will be putting
aside the wish of every province except
Ontario. In the circumstances, I do not
think that would be a fair way to treat the
bill. After all, the witnesses who came before
us this morning talked of an industry that
was 100 per cent American. That is what
they said.

They said that every crime comic

published by these houses was published from
documents, plates or mats from the United
States. Two of the largest publishers of
such crime comics across the border have
opened up branches in Canada for the purpose of producing their own mats or manuscripts.
This means that the Canadian
publishers of crime comics are not publishing original works of Canadians.
No
Canadian artist or writer is employed, so
what interest have we in Canada in helping
or furthering such things?

objects to bringing in the mats from the
United States. He himself is a publisher,
and I would ask if he did not bring in his
main press from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: That has nothing to do
with it.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Honourable senators, I
think the learned member from TorontoTrinity has enough solid argument without
bringing personal matters into this discussion. His argument would be much stronger
if lie made use of logic instead of personalities. My friend knows very well that
that there are only two countries-the
United States and Great Britain-from which
presses can be imported. As a matter of
fact, at the present time you cannot import
presses from Great Britain; you import them
from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And quite properly.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not want to be

personal or imply any criticism of the honourable gentleman from Bedford for bringing
in a press; but I should like to inquire what
is the distinction between bringing in a press

and bringing in mats.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: There is a great deal of

difference between bringing in a press which
will publish good, sound Canadian literature,

and bringing in printed matter that is prepared in the United States. If my honourable friend cannot see the difference, I think
it is useless for me to argue the point.
I will vote against the amendment because
f am in favour of developing in this country
a true Canadian literature and a true
Canadian spirit. Even though this bill may
impose some hardship on some peoplewhich I do not believe it will-I would go
a long way in supporting it if I thought it

would have the effect of keeping out of
this country printed matter that does not
tend to develop a proper Canadian spirit

amongst our youth.

to the publisher, and in any event notify the
publisher to be careful to see that no more
comics of that kind were included in shipments to him. The bill does create a
possibility of the risk referred to by the
honourable gentleman; but some risk arises
from all legislation of this character, and I
do not think we should make the proposed
amendment to the bill.
It may be out of order to refer to evidence
given before the committee this morning,
but perhaps I may be allowed to mention a
point that was made there. It would appear
from the discussion that a prohibition on
some of the mats which are brought in from
the United States would work a hardship on
the publishers of crime comics. I think that
is one of the ordinary commercial risks in
this type of business.
I believe that the passage of this bill will
mark a forward step by parliament in effecting a prohibition on the publication, distribution and sale of crime comics. For that
reason I am not able to support the amendment of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Mr. Chairman, I do

not wish to tax the patience of my colleagues
for long, but honourable senators will appreciate that I cannot do otherwise than support
the bill for the protection of the youth of this
country against subversive literature or crime
comics.
The problem that troubles me is how the
law is going to be implemented. I quite agree
with the thoughts expressed by my good
friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol). Of
course we are all in agreement as to the purpose of the bill, but regardless of the form in
which it passes, it will not cure the malady
of this century, namely, that the youth of
Canada and of the world generally are more
interested in comics than they are in national
literature and geography.
When the bill is passed who is going to
declare whether or not a comic strip is a
crime comic under the law?
Hon. Mr. Nicol: The judge will.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Let me finish my question. Who is going to say whether or not
certain literature is obscene? As an example
of this problem, I may refer to the movie
Les Enfants de Paradis,which was shown in
the United States, in Ontario, and in some of
the other provinces in Canada, where it was
considered to be a great production. But what
was looked upon as a beautiful piece of acting in Ontario was regarded as a crime in
Quebec. That illustrates the variation in
attitude across the country.

The administration of this law will, I presume, be in the hands of the provincial
Attorneys-General, and it will be their
responsibility to declare what comics are
crime comics. I am told that the chief of
police in each city appoints a man to deal
with such questions of morality. I think it
is a bad thing to have a law under which I,
for instance, could be arrested for having in
my possession a comic which I may think is
a good comic.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The bill does not
refer to comics but to "crime comics".
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: But the comic will have
to be declared to be a crime comic by the
chief of police or his lieutenant.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, by the Court.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: But prior to my appearing
before a judge I would have to be arrested
and detained.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: The Attorney-General
would supervise the procedure.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: But while the comics were
being examined or while the obscene literature was being read, where would I be? Why,
even the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) might be arrested
under such a provision; and my good friend
from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) might be
arrested for publishing comics which to his
mind were not crime comics.
I agree with the remarks of the honourable
senator from Repentigny (Hon. Mr. DuTremblay). I am glad to be on his side, though
all the Liberals are not always in the same
basket. The honourable gentleman has said
that it would be very unjust to pass a law
which might place in the hands of some
prejudiced person power to take action
against a publisher.
I am not prepared to propose an amendment to the bill, but I have a suggestion which
I should like to leave with the committee.
I believe that the Canadian Government
should appoint a board of censors, composed
of one person frorn each province, to review
all comics and literature published or offered
for sale and determine whether the material
is suitable for public distribution. In that
way literature would corne under much the
same kind of control as the movies. I understand that in each province there is a board
which sees all movies before they are
exhibited to the public. My honourable friend
from Repentigny (Hon. Mr. DuTremblay) has
just reminded me that such a board of censors
would have to receive the approval of the
provinces.

confess that after several times reading the
bill now before the house, there were some
provisions which I could not understand
without the help of departmental officials, and
I regret that we have such a short time to
study the measure.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are no worse off than
the Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not intend to
take up the time of the house by going over
the bill section by section, as I feel that it
will be necessary to do that in the Banking
and Commerce Committee. If honourable
senators have no objection I shall take some
of the more important amendments dealt with
in the bill.
The main purpose of the bill is of a relieving nature. It contains provisions which in
effect relieve corporations and individuals
from tax liabilities which were considered
unfair, and in other cases it puts into effect
the reduction in taxes. In the early part of
the bill there are certain relieving provisions,
such as the granting of a reasonable allowance for travelling expenses to employees
engaged in selling property on commission;
the granting of reasonable allowances to a
minister of the gospel while travelling in the
performance of his duty; allowance to clergymen for rents paid for premises occupied by
them, and allowances of the value of the
premises occupied. There are also allowances
made for the exemption of railway agents,
transport employees and others.
Section 3 of the bill is of a relieving
nature, whereby persons who are resident in
Canada and are shareholders of corporations
which are controlled in the United Statesthat is corporations in which 50 per cent or
more of the voting shares are held in the
United States-are relieved of taxes on certain dividends when winding up and so forth.
It relieves them of liabilities on taxes on
winding up, redemption of shares, conversion
of shares or capitalization of surpluses.
Obviously the shareholders have no control
of the corporation's actions in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Is this section to provide
for actual cases?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I understand not. It is
a general relieving section to meet a situation that has been brought to the attention
of the department in many cases where there
has been reconstruction of the company's
capital in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Especially United States
Steel.
Hon. Mr. Campbell:

I think

honourable

senators would be satisfied if I illustrated one

or two types of cases. Where a corporation
in the United States declares a stock dividend,
in other words capitalizes its surplus, there
is no tax imposed upon the resident in the
United States in receipt of that stock dividend; but under our law a tax is imposed. As
such action can be taken freely in the United
States, it has meant that the shareholder in
Canada has really received no cash whatsoever. He has received shares on the declaration of a stock dividend, and has been
required to include the value of the shares
in his taxable income.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That could take place in
Canada as well. If the stock dividend is
declared in Canada, it is taxable.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, il is taxable in

Canada. If a company in Canada has an
earned surplus in Canada and declares a stock
dividend and distributes the shares, the shareholder in Canada must include it in his
income. This section provides that if he is
a holder of shares in a foreign corporation of
which 50 per cent or more of the stock is held
outside of Canada, and is in receipt of a
similar stock dividend, it is not taxable.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is limited to 50 per cent
or more.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that not a discrimina-

tion against shareholders of Canadian comDanies?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No, it deals with holders of shares in a foreign corporation.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would my honourable
friend explain to the house the reason for
this amendment, dealing particularly with the
case of the United States Steel Corporation?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not know that I
am entirely familiar with it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know it, and I will explain
it.
The corporation had a certain reserve
and wanted to strengthen its capital account,
and transferred so much money from the
reserve account to the capital account. The
stock, before anything was done, w.as worth,
say, $130 a share. After everything had transpired it was still worth that amount, but
nobody got any money at all. What has
occurred in the past is that the Canadian
shareholders have been notified that that kind
of thing was going to take place in the United
States, and they sold their stock in that
country and two days later bought it back
again. In this case the United States Steel
Corporation did not notify the Canadian
shareholders that it was going to do this, and
the result was that those people had to pay
a tax in this country although the stock was

DECEMBER 7. 1949
not worth a cent more than before. Perhaps
I should not say it, but I think this was done
in connection with the income tax laws of
the United States. There was a loss on capital
account and there was a desire to cover it up.
But it only meant that the Canadian shareholder had what he had before.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But under this amendment the Canadian shareholder will not be
deemed to have received, in this country, a
dividend which he did not in fact receive.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: From the Hansard
report of the debate in another place it
appears to have been felt that farmers and
fishermen would not be able to interpret the
provisions of these two sections. I have not
been able to discover any other reason. When
I studied the sections I felt that farmers and
fishermen may want to be made subject to
them.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: If the sections are to apply
only to those who can interpret them, some of
us should be exempted.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I hope that by the time

sections 7 and 8?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. I shall have
something to say about the rates later. Then
suppose he sells part of the asset for $100,000.
He then reduces the value of his asset for
depreciation purposes by $100,000. He does
not pay any taxes on the $100,000. The
reiainder of his asset is worth $400,000, but
assume that in the next few months he sells
that remainder for $500,000. He will then
have made a profit of $100,000, which must
be included in his return for purposes of
taxation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would the whole $100,000
be subject to taxation?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The whole $100,000
would in that case be subject to taxation.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that not something new?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, it is.

Hon. Mr. Davies: A tax on capital profits.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is not a tax on
capital profits, because the owner is not
obliged to take depreciation.
The honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) asked a question about
rates. The rates will be charged on the
diminishing or reducing balance basis of the
assets from time to time in the taxpayer's
possession. The rate in each case will be
flexible, from perhaps 1 to 20 or 30 per cent,
within a very wide range. The taxpayer may
decide to take depreciation at the highest
rate in a year of good profits, or he may
write his own rate into his return. Suppose,
for sake of illustration, that he writes off an
asset in five years of good profits. If he
carries on operations after that he will not
be entitled to any further depreciation on
that asset which has been written down to
no value, but if lie sells the asset after that
he must account for it. If he ceases to carry
on business and sells the asset at a profit,
he must pay a tax on that profit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the asset has an
appreciated value at the time of sale does lie
pay tax on the amount of appreciation as well
as on the original value?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: He never pays a tax
on anything higher than the original cost.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He pays the tax on the
original base price as of January 1, 1949.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the figure that
applies.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: In other words, lie
never pays a tax on anything in respect of
which he has not received a tax credit by
way of depreciation.

Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
May I just ask another question by way
of illustration?
Suppose a man buys a
frame house for $10,000 for rental purposes,
on which lie is allowed 5 per cent-if it were
brick he would be allowed 21 per centand by January 1 of this year depreciation
had reduced the value of the house to $5,000
for tax purposes, as I understand it, when
he sells the house lie does not have to pay
income tax on the excess of sale value over
the amount to which it has been depreciated.
Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is correct as it
applies to a house where the owner has not
taken anything other than ordinary depreciation.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: After 1949.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: There is a further
provision on that pointHon. Mr. Haig: Is one permitted to take
more than 5 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Can one take whatever he
likes?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Let me complete my
answer to my friend's question. So far as
the depreciation from January 1, 1949 is
concerned, there will be prescribed a range
within which depreciation can be taken on
particular classes of property.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Where would I get that
information?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That will be under the
regulations to be passed under this bill.
which I understand will be available within
a week or ten days. In other words, the
regulations will make the Act more flexible,
so that a taxpayer can decide whether he
will take 5 per cent, 10 per cent, or whatever
the range permits him to take. Honourable
senators will appreciate the advantage
effected by the provisions to which I have
referred.
Under the present law a taxpayer, even
when he suff ers a loss, must take 50 per
cent of his normal depreciation on property
in any taxation year, and in respect of which
he never has had a tax credit. Under the
new regulation lie may in a loss year make
an election not to take any depreciation, or,
for some other reason lie may elect to take
a very low rate of depreciation. The rate
allowed is on the diminishing balance from
time to time.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Would the honourable
member indicate what would happen in the

DECEMBER 7, 1949
event of a loss on the disposal of a depreciated asset? Suppose the depreciated asset
is sold for less than book value, is any
adjustment made?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, any loss which is
suffered on the sale of property after January
1, 1949, will be taken into account in the
same way as profit would be. The asset's
value for depreciation purposes is adjusted
from time to time by means of crediting the
losses and debiting the profits.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It would appear right in
the depreciation account at the actual
amount?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question by
way of illustration? Suppose in a bad year
I lose money, and accordingly take into
account some depreciation. As I have no
taxable income, that depreciation does not
help me. Then I have a prosperous year,
and have a high taxable income. In that
second year may I make up for the depreciation I did not take in the first year?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, as long as you
stay within the range prescribed in the regulations. The arrangement in that respect is
far more flexible than anything we have had
so far.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But what is the purpose
of all this? I can see no purpose for it,
except perhaps to get more taxes, though I
am not thinking of that. Does the department not want to allow depreciation in the
ordinary way any more? What brought this
all about?

after further study and application to specific
cases, I became convinced that it was
workable.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask a question
of my friend? Is it not true that under
present regulations a person who has depreciated an article to a considerable extent on
his books, and then sells it at an amount
greater than its depreciated value, is obliged
to pay income tax on the profit?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No.
Hon. Mr. Moraud:

Some.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: For instance, depreciation to a certain amount is allowed on a
truck for each year of use. After some years,
when the truck is sold for an amount greater
than its depreciated value, is the owner not
liable for income tax on the difference?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Not under the present
legislation, unless the man is in a particular
class of business, such as construction, where
the operator is allowed to take depreciation
on the total value of his equipment for a
particular job. In calculating his profit on
a job he undertakes that when he sells any
of his equipment he will take into consideration the normal rate of depreciation allowed
on trucks and other vehicles.

Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend from Northumberland might get some refunds.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is not the law in
New Brunswick.

Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
It is extremely difficult to say how the

scheme will work out in practice. It is new,
but it seems to have been very carefully on the disposal of the property.
While I am still on my feet, may I menthought out. I must say that upon a first
reading of the legislation I could not see tion that the important question to me is,
how it would be practicable in al cases, but what are the rates going to be and within

SENATE
what range will they apply? These provisions will not appear in the statute but
will, I understand, come out in the forrn of
regulations. The freedom that one will
have within certain brackets applicable to
prescribed classes is something which is
tremendously important. I understand that
the regulations are not yet available.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: They are not available.
The point the honourable senator raised
brings up another question. Where you have
taken other than what might be regarded as
normal depreciation, where extra or special
depreciation has been allowed during the war
with respect to construction for war purposes, and you sell at a profit, the tax is the
same as under the highest rate of depreciation
on motor vehicles.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As I understand the answer,
if the honourable senator is in the lumber
business and owns trucks used in that business, and a truck is valued on January 1,
1949, at $1,000, and in 1950 he takes off
another $100 and turns round and sells it for
$1,500, he has to account for the hundred
dollars.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: In New Brunswick I am
made accountable for the profit I make on a
truck over and above the depreciated value
at which it stands on my books.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And that condition continues.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: I am thinking of the
small property owner, to which I believe this
section applies. If he sells a bouse for more
than he paid for it, that profit to a certain
extent is taxable, and it is a tax on capital
gain.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If the honourable mernber is speaking of a residence, that is not so.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Well, I have in mind the
sort of residence frequently found in Quebec,
and also in Ontario. A large number of
property owners have the sort of building
which contains two or three tenements or
apartments. If the property owner sells his
property at a profit, is that profit taxable?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If he has taken depreciation after January 1, 1949. In other words,
if he has made his tax return on the basis of
saying that he receives rent for a portion of
that property, occupies a portion, and takes
depreciation, and then realizes a profit over
and above the depreciated figure as of January 1, 1949, be would be liable to the tax.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Even though he uses the
depreciation allowance to improve or maintain his property?

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Well, yes. Of course,
if be uses that as capital it increases the
capital value of the asset. If he has made his
repairs out of income be would be taxed on
the profit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was not here when the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) began his explanation, so I may
not understand it correctly. What troubles me
is this. Suppose be takes depreciation in,
perhaps, small amounts year by year, upon
which be would pay a very low income tax,
and some years afterwards sells the property
for a very large sum, does he pay on the
entire sum in the one year at the increased
rates?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The values are determined as of January 1, 1949.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Think about ten years
from now.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: He has the option of
setting his own rates of depreciation. If he
takes depreciation at, say, 30 per cent of that
value, and sells the property, be is accountable for the profit up to the value at the time,
January 1, 1949. If he receives something
over and above that, that is still capital profit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is the rate which I am
concerned with. If he takes depreciationadmittedly in small figures-say at 30 per
cent a year, or perhaps at a lesser rate, but
the figures are quite small and the rate may
be low-and ten years from now be is hit with
the tax on the whole amount in one year, does
he go in the higher brackets in consequence
and have to pay in income tax pretty nearly
the whole amount of his profit? Or will he
be allowed to pay the tax which be would
have paid had be paid it from year to year?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If I interpret this section correctly, this is a disposal of all his
assets, so that it would fall in as cash profit
in that year and be would be liable for
taxation in that year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; be will come in the
higher schedule.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: In that connection there
will be certain conditions which will give
rise to individual problems: there is no question about that.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is the honourable member suggesting that in those circumstances the
amount of the profit in excess of the amount
of depreciation charged off subsequent to
January 1, 1949, would be added to his taxable income?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would always be
limited by the amount of depreciation he had
actually charged since January 1, 1949.

DECEMBER 7, 1949
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The rate of depreciation
year by year may be low, but when, ten years
from now, he sells his property, he pays on
the whole sum in the one year at the increased
rate.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Whatever the rate is.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He is running an awful
risk in taking depreciation at ail.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: He has to take it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He may have to. But
I could easily imagine, if the 1949 base is the
true value of the property, and from time to
time he depreciates it to nothing, and then
sells at the old figure and the government
applies a high rate of income tax to that, it
would take pretty nearly his whole property
away from him. He might have to pay in
taxation f rom 50 to 75 per cent of the amount
for which he sold the property.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Is not the answer that
he takes it away from himself? He has
depreciated it down to nothing, or what in his
own eyes is nothing, and all he gets from it is
sheer profit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is an awfully heavy
fine that is being levied on him.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Let us suppose that
a man dies and his estate sells his house.
Would the widow have to pay income tax on
the profit upon the sale of that house before
she paid her succession dues?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: She would have to pay
both income tax on the profit on the sale, and
succession duties.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: The widow has to pay
income tax on that property before she can
pay succession duties.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: We will presume that in the
case discussed by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) the
value of the house bas decreased over ten
years. It was worth $10,000 and is now worth
$5,000. The owner can sell it for $10,000, and
if he does he has $5,000 as income. Would he
have the right to give away that house?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: He would have to pay
gift tax on it.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: He would have to pay a gift
tax, but that would be a light imposition
because the property is appreciated $5,000.
According to the honourable senator's argument he is giving .away a property having a
tax value of $5,000 and is paying gift tax
on a property worth $5,000. I may have
something more to say when the bill comes
45785-30

back, but in the meantime I will merely
remark that we shall find that a number of
people will be up to a lot of new tricks.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I am sure there will
be no end to the questions which will occur
to honourable senators, but I would say that
members of the department who are responsible for the drafting of this legislation will
be available in committee when the matter
is considered there. I think therefore I may
shorten my explanation of this section.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Without dealing with
the bill clause by clause, I should like to
touch upon other changes in the law which
are proposed in the bill. I would refer honourable members to section 17. As the Minister
of Finance announced in the budget resolution, there is a new departure from the
past laws of taxation. In effect it is the elimination of the double taxation. The shareholder of a Canadian corporation who
receives dividends from shares of any class
may deduct from his income tax an amount
equal to 10 per cent of the dividends received
from shares of a Canadian corporation. This
is dealt with by the present bill under
section 17.
Hon. Mr. Davies: He deducts that from his
tax?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The only change there is
that you add "preferred dividends".
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The resolution as
brought down covers common stock, and since
the resolution has been brought down the
bill bas been drafted so as to include dividends from al share capital. The Minister
of Finance, when introducing the legislation,
pointed out that it was desired to encourage
the investment of risk capital in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if a Canadian company or corporation must be located in Canada only in
so far as its executive headquarters is concerned?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It must be a Canadian
corporation which is paying taxes in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Taxes may be paid on
shares in Canada, and it still may be operat.
ing outside of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. May I just read
section 17?
An individual who was resident in Canada at any
time in a taxation year may deduct from the tax

Hon. Mr. Hayden: The definition of a taxable corporation is given at the bottom of
the same page.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Section 18 of the bill
repeals sections 36 and 37 of the present Act,
and provides for a decrease in the tax of
small corporations by which the tax rate is
10 per cent on the first $10,000 of earnings
of every corporation. It is proposed for the
purpose of helping small corporations.
There is another provision of the bill in
respect to which I should like to make an
explanation. It is section 47, which is on
page 36. Some objection has been taken to
It reads as
the wording of this section.
follows:
No taxpayer shall be deemed ever to have been
entitled by virtue of subsections one and two A
of section eight of the Incorne War Tax Act and
section nine of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, to
deduct from the taxes otherwise payable under
either or both of those Acts for a taxation year an
amount or amounts exceeding, in the aggregate,
that proportion of the tax or taxes so otherwise
payable for the year ...

This section, as honourable senators will
see, is of a retroactive character. It is to
prevent corporations getting tax credit beyond
the amount of taxes they would pay in
Canada on dividends brought in from the
United States subsidiaries by reason of having a higher tax in the United States to set
off the Canadian tax payable in Canada. This
section has been amended so as now to include
only what are called "foreign companies".
These are companies which always had the
privilege of bringing over their dividends tax
free. They are the only companies affected
by this provision. It is felt that they should
not be given this extra benefit which, in
effect, would have amounted to a reduction
of the taxes paid in Canada, by reason of
having brought over these tax-exempt dividends. The section as drafted will appear
before the committee in its amended form.
I do not think there are any other novel
features dealt with by the proposed bill. As
the time is getting late, unless there are some
questions, I would suggest that the honourable members give the bill a second reading
and refer it to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce. The most important phase
of the whole bill is that dealing with the quesThere are many section of depreciation.

reduced rates, and for the purpose of tidying
up the legislation as it was last year, and
making it more workable and more understandable.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Personal corporations
are dealt with in the same manner here as
they were heretofore, except that there is a
provision whereby they also get the benefit

shall be deemed to have distributed its
dividends each year, and as no taxes are payable by personal corporations, the shareholder
who receives that money and pays the tax,
will be entitled to that 10 per cent reduction
in respect of dividends received by the
personal corporation from other taxable
Canadian companies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does the same law apply
that presently applies? For instance, if I am
a shareholder in a private corporation and
my share of the profits for the year are, say,
$1,000, that becomes part of my income and
I do not pay any tax on the private corporation at all?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: May I ask the acting leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) if the Banking
and Commerce Committee will sit this evening to discuss this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think so.
because it is rather late to contact the appropriate officials. I may say for the information of honourable senators that we have four
or five bills on our Order Paper, and I was
going to suggest to the house that we sit this
evening to dispose of these bills.
All the honourable members who have
charge of the bills are present and will be
ready to make their explanations tonight. It
should be possible to clear the order paper
this evening, and I would suggest that the
Banking and Commerce Committee meet
tomorrow morning and consider the Income
Tax Bill and other measures.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I regret exceedingly that it is necessary to
do what the honourable gentleman suggests,
for I shall not be able to attend the committee meeting tomorrow morning. In the circumstances I suggest that we arrange to have
the official reporters present at the committee
meeting to make a verbatim report of the
evidence, and that the report be distributed
to all ýmembers. Knowing that I had to leave
Ottawa tonight I tried desperately to have the
Income Tax Bill brought. on yesterday and
dealt with in committee before I went away.
I should have liked to ask departmental
officers a number of questions, especially

DECEMBER 7. 1949
about depreciation, for I honestly think that
the amendment is the thin edge of the wedge
-the beginning of an attack on capital gain.
I cannot see it in any other way.
If this bill passes, why would a person
invest in a house or other residential property
that he intended to rent? In the past one of
the great inducements to an investor was the
allowance of annual depreciation-on a brick
or stone building at the rate of 21 per cent,
and on a frame building at 5 per cent. On the
face of them the rates probably appeared to
be much more generous than they really were
in the light of experience. The district in
which you build a house today may be a first
class one, but in ten years' time a shift of
population may reduce the value of the property materially. Let me give an illustration.
It is a bit personal, but the best evidence
in these things comes from personal knowledge. In 1914 I bought a house for $5,000,
and from 1917 to 1940, a period of 23 years,
I depreciated it at 5 per cent a year. I
had unknowingly continued to depreciate
it for three years longer than I should
have, and I would not have known about
it even then if the department had not
called my attention to it. I asked them why
they had not disallowed the depreciation for
the last three years, and they said that they
themselves had not noticed it. Naturally, I
made a refund. But from 1914 to 1940, owing
to the character of the district, I could never
have sold that house for much more than
$2,000. By 1941, however, because of changes
that had taken place in the locality-the
streetcar tracks were taken up, and an industrial plant was moved away and replaced by
a nice block-I was able to sell the building
for $5,000. Now, under this law I would have
had to pay tax for 1941 on the whole $5,000.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: What was the cost of
the building?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Originally $5,000. But I
would never have dared to take off depreciation year by year if I had known that later
on all the amounts of annual depreciation
would be lumped together in one sum. Nobody
would knowingly take off depreciation in
those circumstances. That was the point made
by the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Moraud: That was also the argument of the gentleman from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson).
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. If after the house had
been entirely depreciated I had died and
left an estate of over $50,000, under this bill
my family would have been taxed on that
house. That is a capital levy. Why should I
45785-301

put money into that kind of thing when I can
invest it in other things and run less chance
of losing it?
Hon. Mr. Moraud: In government bonds, for
instance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I would have been
better off if I had bought government bonds
in 1914.
In trying to decide whether you should
depreciate property year by year you have
to consider not future conditions alone but
conditions as they may be some years from
now. Suppose a man bought a house ten years
ago for $10,000, and against his rent receipts
charged annual depreciation at 5 per cent.
The depreciated value of the property today
would be $5,000. In trying to decide whether
it would be wise to continue writing off depreciation the owner has to gamble on what the
house will be worth in future, say ten years
from now. If he thinks it will be worth only
$4,500, he should charge $500 depreciation
for one year and make no write-off after that.
There is no doubt that this legislation is the
thin edge of a capital levy. It is a challenge
to the very kind of investment that we ought
to be encouraging people to make.
When I was a boy, and that was at a time
when some other senators were boys, it was
quite common for an artisan in a city or town
to own not only the house in which he lived
but perhaps one or more other houses besides.
A carpenter or plumber or bricklayer, for
instance, might hear that a house two or three
doors away from his own was for sale, for
say $2,000, and he would buy it, because he
considered it a good investment. He understood house values. If I had gone to such a
man and suggested that he buy Dominion
Government bonds he would have said "I
have no trust in government bonds, because I
know nothing about them, and I do not trust
your judgment, but I do trust my own judgment on house values." He would buy a
bouse now and then, as his funds permitted,
with the object of having sufficient income
to retire at the age of 65. This bill would put
an end to all that kind of investment, because
house values change with changing conditions.
A five-room house in Winnipeg or Toronto
or Montreal today will sell for proportionately
much more per room than a house of fifteen
rooms.
The kind of investor I have been speaking
of in my illustration is not an educated man.
He is not an accountant or a lawyer, and he
would be likely to write off depreciation every
year. But after his death some lawyer might,
unfortunately, have to say to his widow, "I
am awfully sorry, but you will have to refund
to the government a considerable sum,
because during the last ten years your

SENATE

husband wrote off depreciation on houses that
you have now sold. It all comes down to a
question of values, and what you are going
to invest your money in. This bill, in the
final analysis, is a capital levy, and for that
reason I think it ought to be opposed.
Why did the government, when the measure
was before the other house, decide to drop
fishermen and farmers from its purview? My
honourable friend who explained the bill
offered the excuse that persons in these
classes could not understand its provisions.
Let me tell him that I was in the gallery of
the other house and heard the Minister of
Finance say that be could not understand it
either. I asked a member of that house to
explain it to me, and be too did not understand it.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Then you had better not
give any advice on it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I am afraid

of. I think that if a real fight were put up
in the committee, and I am sorry that I am
not going to be here tomorrowHon. Mr. Burchill: Better cancel your
reservation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think my vote
would make much difference. The fact is
that we will be back in session around the
first of February, and after the government
has had an opportunity to read the debates on
the bill I predict that the minister and his
advisers will want to take a second look at
this part of the measure. It is all very well
to say that the United States has a capital
levyHon. Mr. Davies: Fifty per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -but they are sorry now
that they have it. It is a lot of trouble to
them. The British investigated every angle
of it, and then decided against it. The problem under such a system arises from the
fact that in good years the capital levy pays
off, but in bad years it does not pay off at all.
The very time the country needs the revenue
there is nothing coming in, and when there
is no need for money, capital levy pays off.
The result is that the country is careless in
the good years and hard up in the poor years.
When the committee meets tomorrow I think
it should try to persuade the minister to drop
this clause from the bill for this year, and let
the department further examine the proposal.
The remainder of the bill, as I read it,
seems to be all right. I am undecided about
this 33 per cent question, and some other
features, but they are not serious.
When I read the sections dealing with
depreciation. I could not understand them
at all. I thought it was perhaps because I

was stupid or had had a bad night, so I went
to another member of this house and asked
him to read them over. He did so, and called
me in the next morning and said, "There must
be something wrong with my head, for I do
not understand this bill." I met a high
official from one of the departments at the
recent Montreal-Calgary rugby game in
Toronto, and I told him that I did not understand this depreciation business. He replied
that it was easily interpreted. I pressed him
to tell me what it meant. He said, in effect
that it meant that a house or other building,
or a machine or other equipment, could be
sold above its depreciated value-that is if
it was depreciated on or after January 1,
1949-but that the profit on the transaction
was income in the year of the sale. I thought
be explained it in as few words as possible,
and I do not think much more could have
been added. I told my friend that I was
opposed to the idea, and I speak against it
now with as much emphasis as I can.
Income tax in this country is a very
heavy burden. Some people say that the man
who makes the money should pay the tax.
But there is another side to the story. With
a few exceptions, the men who have higher
incomes make greater contributions to business and to the country than others with less
income. For instance, the head of a newspaper organization certainly contributes more
to the country at large than the man who
sets the type, for he makes the business possible. Also, the head of a large department
store in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver or
Winnipeg surely contributes more to our
country than does the boy who opens the
front door in the morning. There are those
who want to extend taxation to the stage
where the government will take all the
advantage of that ability away from the man
who has it. Income tax does just that. We
talk about freedom, but it only takes a burdensome income tax law to control a whole
nation.
Why did the Minister of Finance remove
from the bill the provisions as to preferred
stock? He said-and I have no doubt it is
true-that it was because of the difficulty of
getting people to put their money into risk
capital instead of government-guaranteed
bonds. Why should any man or woman invest
money in risk capital when, if it turns out
well, the government may take from 50 per
cent to 80 per cent in income tax. The income
tax law smothers any incentive to invest in
risk capital. If I were a broker or an accountant, and people asked my advice as to what
to do with their money, I would say to them
"Don't put it in anything that is risky,

DECEMBER 7, 1949
because if you win the government takes it
and if you lose you take the rap". That is
the difficulty today.
I am going to say something which I have
said before, and no doubt will say again
many times. We are entering a period when
the world is beginning to adjust itself, and
there is not going to be so much free money
floating around. Canada is a great country,
but she requires a great deal of capital for
development purposes. Unless we give our
men and women a fair chance in the investment field, we will not have the money for
development purposes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How are we to get money
to meet the demands that we have undertaken with our eyes open?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We lost $60 million in
China, and I regret every night that I did not
kick harder about that matter when I had
a chance to do so. My friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) will agree that we lent
many millions of dollars in China and got
nothing in return.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And lots more besides.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As it is 6 o'clock I shall
stop now and resume when the Senate
reconvenes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suggest that the
house reconvene at 8 o'clock to continue the
business on the order paper.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
At eight o'clock the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, at
6 o'clock I was speaking on the subject of
income tax; and I have nearly finished. I
have reviewed the question of depreciation
as far as I want to go, because I believe that
others who are to follow me will also deal
with it. There is one point in this connection
on which I am not clear, but I put so many
questions to the proponent of the bill that I
did not like to ask him any more. It has to
do with provision for fire insurance. Let us
assume that my house is worth for rental
purposes $10,000, that I insure it for that
amount, and that it burns down at a time
when the property has been depreciated to,
say, $5,000. What happens? Does the government require me to put up $5,000 as income?
As a result of the fire I have lost $5,000. It
may be said that in any event I would have
lost it some day. I do not know. A depression
might come along and I might be compelled
to sell at the worst period of the slump. I
hope that somebody will ask this question in
committee tomorrow morning; and in saying
this I am looking at the honourable member

for LaSalle (Hon. Mr. Moraud), and the
honourable member for Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden).
The reason I have asked for a record of the
proceedings tomorrow morning is this. Every
member of the Senate is anxious that our
income tax law shall be fairly and honestly
administered. It is not my experience that
there is much crookedness in connection with
the observance of this law, but as a practising
lawyer I have encountered a number of cases
where difficulty has arisen because, after a
man died, it appeared that he did not comply
with the law because he did not know what
the law was. I recall that when, in 1917, the
first income tax bill was introduced, the then
Minister of Finance was asked a lot of questions in the House of Commons-was, so to
speak, put through a quiz-and the report,
taken from Hansard of that day, was published and proved very helpful indeed. It was
with that idea in mind that I proposed that
tomorrow morning's proceedings should be
reported. Questions can be asked about depreciation, which is a very important feature in
this bill, and these questions, with the answers
to them, can be used by the department, if
so desired, as a memorandum or distribution.
It will be very valuable.
Before proceeding further, there are one or
two things I forgot to say which I should
like to mention. Technically "speaking, the
first, I admit, is not germane to this bill, but
practically it is connected with it. The Commissioner of Income Tax for the Manitoba
Division has been promoted to Vancouver; the
Vancouver Commissioner has been promoted
to Toronto; and one of the higher officials in
the Ottawa office, namely the man in charge
of succession duties, has been assigned to
Winnipeg. I have only met the Ottawa
official; I know the Winnipeg man, Mr.
Lowrey, much better. He has been very
efficient, obliging and satisfactory, and I think
it is the unanimous opinion of Winnipeg members of the profession to which I belong, as
well as of the accountants and business people
who have to deal with the department, that
he has given very fine service as Commissioner, in the administration of the Act in the
province of Manitoba.
Though some of my remarks may give the
impression that I am mainly concerned with
criticism, I wish to give the government
credit for having recently increased to $1,000
the exemption of a single person. I know
that this change was announced last winter,
and that it was used in the election during
the summer. It is now coming into effect. I
think it is a step in the right direction,
although I am not sure whether under present
conditions exemptions of $1,000 for a single
person and $2,000 for a married couple are

SENATE
adequate. I should have been inclined to
increase the first to $1,250 and the second to
$2,500.
There is one other plea that I should like
to offer, though I know that I shall make no
headway with it. The taxability of earnings
in exce;s of $250 by a married woman
amounts in reality to a reduction of the
husband's exemption. I think the wife's
exemption should be not less than $500. I
believe that the earnings of married women
would be substantially less but for the great
necessity of obtaining more money for their
households.
I make one more appeal. Perhaps it cannot
be implemented; but it is very evident to me
that as far as farmers and primary producers
are concerned, income tax forms should be
made more simple, and should contain an
allowance for what I may describe as
unchargeable amounts. I was born and
brought up on a farm, and remained there
until I was twenty-two years of age, so I
speak with some knowledge when I say
that 1 do not see how the ordinary farmer can
keep track of the costs of his repairs and his
various other disbursements. He can guess
at the amount and lump it, and that is all he
can do. His case is quite different from that
of a business man, for to keep account of
everything is part of the routine of an office.
As a practising lawyer, I have had a great
many farmers come ta my office for help in
making out their income tax returns. When
asked for particulars of their expenses, they
just throw up their hands. If you work all
day in the field you are not likely, when you
get home, to sit down and make an exact
record of your expenses. I know the honourable member from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) does not know much about it
because, although he is a farmer, he is like
one of those people we heard about who do
their farmingHon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
had better be careful, or like the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
I shall rise on a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not call the honourable senator an agriculturist; I only called
him a farmer, so be has not the same ground
of complaint as the honourable member from

worked all day in the field, when he comes
home at 7 or 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening

books and putting down all his expenses. By
the time be comes to town to get help in

matters which the department should look
into and to which it should give some
consideration.

Another point of criticism is that in the
prairie provinces departmental officials have
harassed farmers a great deal about making
their returns. The provision extending from
three ta five years the period over which
depreciation and losses may be calculated has
made matters much better for the producer.
I do not know precisely what remedy can be
applied, but I plead for a simpler form of
tax return for farmers, fishermen, and other
primary producers, all of whom would
benefit by it.
I do not think the class of small house
owners should be included within the scope
of the depreciation clause. They are in a
different class from owners of general manufacturing or industrial properties. I would
suggest that tomorrow, when the minister
and his officials come before the committee,
they be asked to exclude householders. I have
in mind not the type of householder who,
like myself, owns a house and lives in it, but
the person who owns two or three houses;
the number, of course, could be limited as
far as owners' eligibility is concerned.
In a great many cases be needs depreciation

unemployed, and you could not get any more
out of them. If you forced them out on the
street you would create even greater unemployment. These years should be taken into
consideration, and it hardly seems fair to
introduce this depreciation feature now that
prices are up.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable sena
tors, yesterday when discussing excise tax 1
said that when we find a bill before us that
gives statutory effect to substantial reductions in taxation, we should feel happy about
it and not be too critical of the other provisions of the bill. Therefore my first words
must be words of appreciation of the benefits
provided in this bill-benefits which we have
enjoyed since the budget came down at the
last session of parliament.
Having said this, I wish to direct attention
to certain phases of the bill so that honourable senators may be prepared to seek
information on some of the vital points of
the bill when the minister and his assistant
come before them in committee.
The first matter to which I wish to direct
your attention is the date-January 1, 1949upon which the depreciation provisions in
A great many
this bill become effective.
companies periodically during the year issue
financial statements of their operations, and

DECEMBER 7, 1949
in these statements, which are made public,
they take the benefit of the depreciation to
which they are entitled under the provisions
of the existing statute. When you come down
to the twelfth month of the year you find that
many of these companies have already issued
three quarterly statements. Some of their
shares may even be listed on various
exchanges, and in some cases the public have
acquired ownership of these shares on the
basis of those financial statements.
In this bill there are to be found a number
of principles relating to depreciation. One
of them is called the diminishing rate of
depreciation. Up to the present time the
depreciation has been constant in each year.
For instance, heretofore on certain classes
of assets it has been 10 per cent of the
original capital value, but under the proposed amendments the depreciation will be
taken on a diminishing basis. This means
that in the first year it will be 10 per
cent of $100; the next year it will be 10
per cent of $80, and so on. Companies which
may have been taking depreciation for a
period of 8, 10 or 12 years on some of their
assets, and are still calculating at the basic
rate of depreciation on the original capital
value, will find that by the end of the yearif they are brought into line with the requirements of this bill-they are in a position
where they will not be able to write off an
amount of depreciation equal to the amount
they have already charged in their three
quarterly statements.
Without criticizing the new method of
depreciation, the fact that it is brought in
in December, 1949, and is to apply retroactively to January 1, 1949, is bound to
misunderstanding
and
confusion
create
among the public who, relying upon the
quarterly financial statements, have acquired
company shares. Incidentally, when I speak
of the acquisition of shares, I am not necessarily referring to acquisition by wealthy
men who buy into all these corporations,
because an examination of the shareholder
lists of the large corporations discloses that
a fairly representative cross-section of the
public of Canada is included among the
shareholders.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You mentioned a few
minutes ago that under the new regulations,
10 per cent of $100 would come off the first
year and 10 per cent of $90 the second year,
and so on. I am just wondering whether the
farmers and fishermen of Canada are not
going to be worse off than they are under the
present system of depreciation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. There is little
difference whether you apply a constant rate
of 10 per cent to your capital costs each year,
or whether you apply the 10 per cent against

the net capital value each year. I would
not favour one system over the other so long
as there is a fair starting point. The public
should know at the beginning of the year
that the law is thus and so, rather than in
the twelfth month of the fiscal period.
The only difference in the methods is that
the life of the assets for depreciation purposes
would be a little longer if the rate of depreciation in each year were applied against the
reduced capital value of the assets rather
than against the original cost. It is not my
purpose to criticize one method and praise
the other. I merely point out the confusion
and uncertainty in the minds of the public
in trying to harmonize the two systems. It
would be much simpler if January 1, 1950,
were made the effective date for bringing
into force the new method of depreciation.
May I deal now with the method of depreciation itself, as proposed in the bill? I think
it is basically this. For instance, suppose I
receive rents frorn a property that originally
cost me $10,000. Over a period of years I
have depreciated it regularly, and when it has
been depreciated to a value of $6,000 I decide
to sell it for $12,000, or a gain of $2,000 over
my original capital cost. Now here is the
way the new formula of depreciation would
apply. I would have to add to my taxable
income for the year in which I sold that
property the difference between the sale price
and the depreciated value-which in this
illustration would be $6,000-or the difference
between the original cost and the depreciated
value, whichever was the lesser. The difference between the original cost of $10,000 and
the depreciated value of $6,000 is $4,000
which would be the lesser sum; so to my
taxable income for the year in which I made
the sale I would have to add $4,000 out of
the sale price of the property, which amount
would be subject to the rates of that year.
In that case I would still be able to keep
the amount of capital gain over the original
cost. That is the method of calculation which
would apply as from the lst of January 1949
in relation to the subsequent sale of property
upon which depreciation was charged under
the proposed method.
If that were all, I suppose that in itself
would be reasonably clear, whatever the
implications may be. One implication, mentioned this afternoon by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
is that the income tax rate in the year of
sale might be very high, whereas depreciation
might have been written off in years when
the income tax rates were very low.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is not only the
difference in rate which may apply from year
to year, but the difference between the rate
which according to the schedule will apply
to the small amount that might be saved

SENATE
from year to year through the writing off of
depreciation and the rate that would apply
to the whole amount.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is not only the
variation from year to year, but the possible
application of a higher rate to the whole
amount.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am going to ask for some
cheap advice.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And that is what you
may get.
Hon. Mr. Haig: A sidewalk opinion. Suppose
a client came to you next year and said,
"Senator, should I take depreciation or not?"
What would your advice be?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot say at the
moment, for I do not know enough about
this bill. My advice would depend somewhat
upon the financial means of the individual
or corporation. If the taxpayer was financially
able to afford a gamble on the future, my
advice would be to take the bird in hand,
charge off depreciation, and gamble on the
future.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But suppose you were asked
for advice by an individual who was not too
well off. Let us say he owned a bouse for
which he had paid $10,000 and which as of
the lst of January 1949 had been depreciated
to $6,000.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In that case I would
advise the owner to keep the house in as
good repair as he could, to charge up against
his rents as much as the department would
allow for maintenance, and keep the capital
gain for himself and gamble on the future.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And not take depreciation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would be my advice.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That would bo my advice
too.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I say a few words
more on the subject of depreciation in relation
to sale price? The bill refers to "the proceeds
of disposition" of a property. Those words
simply mean the amount obtained at a sale.
The bill contains many phrases that certainly
make it difficult to understand readily what
the draftsman was seeking to convey.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They will all help the
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
will notice that I simply commented on the
presence of the phrases and did not criticise
their use.

The "proceeds of disposition" of

a property might include many things. If

a property was expropriated by a governmental authority, the proceeds would be
treated in the same way as if a sale had been
made. Then there is the type of case which

the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
mentioned by way of illustration. If I owned
a house that I rented and had it insured for
its full insurable value, that would in all
probability be more than the depreciated value
of the property, because the insurance would
be on the basis of cost or of fair market value
at the time. If the house was totally destroyed
by fire the proceeds of the insurance policy
would be treated in the same way as if they
were the proceeds of a sale.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You would advise me,
then, not to have a fire?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was going to give a
little different advice. Now, here is a situation
that might be created. If my building were
totally destroyed by fire, and if from the
insurance moneys there were taken an amount
to compensate the government for the depreciation allowances made to me, I would
receive less than the value of the property
at the time of the fire. In other words, I
would not receive from the insurance company enough money to enable me to rebuild
the property at that time.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I presume the honourable
senator knows that when a building is
destroyed by fire the insurance company has
the choice of paying the amount of the policy
or rebuilding the property. If the company
chose to rebuild, what would the government do?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am glad the honourable
gentleman has raised that point. Subsection
3 (c), on page 6 of the bill, says:
"Proceeds of disposition" of property include
(iii) an amount payable under a policy of insur-

ance in respect of loss or destruction of property.
As I see it, property owners will have to be
advised that in addition to insuring their
property as heretofore they may have to
arrange for insurance that would provide
enough money to pay the income tax upon the
amount that would be added to their taxable
income for any year in which they happened
to have their property destroyed, by fire.
There would have to be an added charge for
insurance premiums, so as to give protection
against reduced payment out of the insurance
proceeds.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before my honourable
friend leaves that point, may I ask him if
it is not likely that insurance companies will
work out a policy, perhaps at a higher
premium rate, under which they would

guarantee to rebuild a house that was totally
destroyed?

bill is that depreciation is not something that
one may keep under all circumstances. One
is permitted to take a certain amount out of
operating income and not pay tax on it; but
if the day ever comes when that person makes
d gain on that property in excess of its
original cost, then he must pay back taxes
in whatever category he may have been taxable. That means, in one year a taxpayer
will pay back the equivalent of the amount
by which he escaped taxation in previous
years by reason of depreciation.
Whether
the theory is good or bad, I arn not at the
moment going to say.
I wish to point out that after all the years
in which we have had income tax in Canada,
this bill provides a marked and radical
departure from the prescribed system, in that
it narrows the field in which one can have a
capital gain.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
Before my friend
leaves that point, I may point out that there
was a precedent for this very principle in
connection with special war depreciation. A
company which had depreciated its wartime
plant down to a minimum amount, and later
had sold it for more than the depreciated
value, paid a tax on the difference between
the depreciated value and the amount at
which the property was sold.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is quite true, but
one must remember that that principle was
employei all during the war years. The theory
behind it was very sound, namely, that no
one should be allowed to make an exorbitant
profit out of operations during the war period.
For instance, a man would go to the government and say that he was prepared to spend
some money on a plant and equipment in
order to carry out some particular war contract if be were assured that, by way of
depreciation, he would be allowed the money
that he spent in acquiring the property. The
government said, "Yes, we will do that". In
that way they granted a return of the capital
which had been laid out. But when the government said that the depreciation on that basis
was specially for war purposes, and that apart
from war purposes no particular postwar
value was assumed to be attached to that
property, so that if afterwards it was sold at
a profit over and above the depreciated value,
it also said "We are going to tax all that gain
to you". That was a principle developed in
the stress and emergency of war to deal with
a particular situation, and I think no person
would deny that it was a perfectly justifiable
principle to put in force during the war. But
now we are in effect applying that same sort
of principle to the whole field of depreciation;
and the question is whether it should be donc
or not. It it is a matter of government policy,

there may not be much that we can do about
it, except to make the law so definite and
explicit that everybody will understand it,
and then to try to have it made effective at
a date when it will cause the least disturbance
to business as business is being carried on.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Suppose you take depreciation on a business property-say a manufacturing establishment, or a building where
a merchant's business is being carried onand later you sell the property for a substantial sum, can the government tax any
sum greater than the sum of the depreciation
that has been taken off?
Say you buy a
business property for $50,000, and you
depreciate at two and a half per cent, or
a little over a thousand dollars a year. You
do that for two years, so that $2,000 has been
taken off by way of depreciation. You then
sell for $60,000 the property which cost you
$50,000, and so have a profit of $10,000.
Does the government tax apply on that
$10,000 or only on the $2,000 represented
by depreciation charge?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You would pay income
tax on the $2,000, because the formula provides that you shall take the sale price
minus trhe depreciated value at that time, or
the original cost minus the depreciated
value, whichever is less. In dealing with
depreciation that is recaptured when you
make a sale, the language of the bill leaves
it open to the interpretation that not only
would special and extra depreciation be
deducted, but also any grant or subsidy or
assistance. It does not say in the bill that
that grant, subsidy or assistance would only
be such as might have been given by the
federal authority. I think the language is
broad enough to include any grant, subsidy
or assistance which may have been received
in relation to that property, from whatever
source it came. It might have come from
some provincial source as a special grant.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: What is the section?
Hon.
2 (h):

Mr. Hayden:

Section

7,

(h) where a taxpayer has received or is entitled
to receive a grant, subsidy or other assistance from
a government, municipality or other public authority in respect of or for the acquisiton of property, the capital cost of the property shall be

other assistance.

I do not know what happens if the grant,
subsidy or assistance is made upon a basis
involving some obligation to repay it at a
future date.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would that have application to cases in which, if you build within a

DECEMBER 7, 1949

municipality, the municipality grants tax
exemption for, say, ten or twenty years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I doubt it. Since this
bill is going to committee I do not think I
should spend too long on it now: possibly
I have spent already more time than I
should have. But I felt that there were some
points in connection with this method of
depreciation which should be mentioned.
The restrictive feature is to be found in
several places in the bill. I am not concerned about the subject-matter to which it
applies, but the language does represent a
considerable step in the field of restrictive
Take, for instance,

clause 32, subsection (3), which states:
(3) For greater certainty it is hereby declared
and enacted that, in determining the taxable income
of a non-resident-owned investment corporation
for the purpose of the Income War Tax Act-

Not this Income War Tax Act, but its
predecessor.
-for any taxation year after the effective date of
election under subsection four of section nine of
that Act . . .

That is going back to some indefinite
period when the non-resident-owned investment corporation under the earlier Income
War Tax Act made the election to be classed
as a non-resident-owned investment corporation. And it goes on and retroactively makes
a declaration as to what is and always has
been the effect, the law, and the interpretation of the law, in relation to that company.
Again, in clause 47, page 36, it is stated:
No taxpayer shall be deemed ever to have been
entitled, by virtue of subsections one and two A
of section eight of the Income War Tax Act and
section nine of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940,
to deduct from the taxes otherwise payable under
either or both of those Acts for a taxation year an
amount or amounts exceeding-

thus and so.
I am not examing the subject-matter of
these two sections. What I am pointing out is
a rather unusual and, conceivably, pretty
dangerous provision. Eight or nine or ten
or twelve or fifteen years after the effective
date upon which something has happened
and the incidence of taxation has been
determined in relation to it, you suddenly find
that although you have been following a
practice and assuming it to be the definite
departmental practice it is now provided that
the law as herein laid down, has always been
the law and shall be so deemed. In the
particular cases covered by these two sections
there may be some justification for that
provision. It may be that the department
has followed a certain practice, and is only
saying that this is what the law really means
or is intended to mean. But to wait this
length of time before asking for legal sanction, without having previously asserted the

right so to do, is to say the least quite unusual;
and I think that if there is one place where
we should have as little as possible of the
unusual and as much as possible of what is
definite and certain, it is in the incidence
of taxation. We should not be liable, after
operating for three or five years under a
law which has a certain incidence of taxation,
to be confronted with a statute which declares,
that no matter what has happened, the law
has always been thus and so, and shall be
deemed to be thus and so. I do not know
what is aimed at here, but if we are properly
to exercise our function there are certain
parts of this bill which we should examine
into and inquire why it was necessary to
deal with them in this way.
Honourable senators, there are many other
points with which I could deal, but it would
unnecessarily delay the reference of this bill
to committee.

I do want to repeat what I said when the
Income Tax Bill came before us in the closing
days of the 1948 session. At that time we
were creating a new body of tax laws which
incorporated many changes in the Income
Tax Act, and we had about the same brief
amount of time to consider that measure as
we now have to consider the one before us.
I suppose that if I went back into the history
of previous years I would find that the same
thing had occurred time and again. But
surely the income tax law, if it is so important
to the operation of government, should loom
largely in our minds at the beginning of each
session as something that merits our full
consideration and judgment.
It is physically impossible in the last few
days of a session to give a bill of this importance the consideration it deserves. This
is especially true when the language is so
involved as it is in this measure. I could
read this bill page by page, but it would
be unintelligible to those listening and it
would certainly be mere words to myself.
The only way you can arrive at any interpretation at all is to have the present Income
Tax Act and the previous taxation statute
beside you, take out a pencil and lots of
paper, and then try to work from the financial
statement of some company. You would have
to spell out each section line by line, thinking
to yourself, "What do I write down now?"
Finally, you would have to add, subtract or
multiply the figures you had written clown,
and in this way you would suddenly come
upon some sort of answer.
The bill is certainly difficult to understand.
I do not say this in criticism of those who
created it, but rather to point out the utter
absurdity of throwing such a measure at us
in the last few days of the session and asking
the Senate of Canada to seriously and intelligently give sanction to it. It may be the

448

SENATE

best bill in the world, but we are not given
the necessary time to consider all its implications. The best proof of this is the fact
that the Income Tax Act which was passed
in 1948, and was to become effective on
January 1, 1949, is now being amended in
the bill before us. Therefore, even after two
or three years of drafting and redrafting,
there are certain problems which can only
be cleared up by sitting down and dealing
with them specifically. Surely we should
place the income tax law in its proper and
important position in the list of legislation
we have to consider. It should rank just
about first on our agenda because it affects
the business and industrial life of the country,
and the economie and living conditions of
our people. Surely it is our right, duty and
responsibility to consider this legislation under
circumstances which would enable us to feel
that we have at least given it our thorough
consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Nicol: Honourable senators, it is
not my intention to take up your time, but
I shall not have another opportunity to say
how I feel about the income tax law in general.
Canada is a country with only 13 million
people, a small population, and we have
passed laws for taxing corporations, companies and even those individuals who earn
little money. Before such laws were passed
by the United States that country was already
widely populated and largely developed.
Canada is just starting its development. There
is untold wealth in the West, in Quebec and
in Newfoundland, and our young men should
have an opportunity to go out and accomplish things; but with laws like this it would
seem that we are trying to devise ways and
means to prevent these young men from
making a dollar.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Are we helping to develop
our country and make it populous by passing
such laws? These laws might be good in
older countries, where all the natural
resources have been developed; but for a
young country that needs men of activity,
enterprise and vision, we are passing laws
which prevent our youth from accomplishing
what some of us tried to accomplish when
such laws did not exist.
I am glad that the farmers and fishermen
will be exempted from the provisions of
section 7, but I think the exemption should
apply to other classes. Carpenters and
mechanics, for instance, should be exempted.
How can an ambitious young man with good
training create capital for himself, if we pass
laws that make it impossible for him to make
a capital gain? In my province there are

many centres where young men have banded
together to build themselves houses. In Three
Rivers, for instance, a certain priest got the
young men of his parish together, and they
built ten houses for themselves; and eventually they built 100 bouses under a co-operative scheme. This is now being done in
Sherbrooke, and recently I gave my men a
number of lots upon which to build bouses
under a similar co-operative scheme. But,
should one of them decide in the future to
sell his house, where will the profit go, if
there is any profit? Why should I give a
man a lot upon which to build, if the government is to say, should be decide to sell, that
because he did not pay for it, be made a
profit on it of say $1,500, and must therefore
pay a tax on it. Do you think that we can
help to build this country by passing such
laws?
I am willing that the government should
have all the revenue it needs to carry on the
affairs of this country. When the war came
and the Minister of Finance visited Sherbrooke, I told him that he could levy all the
taxes he required, because we wanted to win
the war. The government took all the money
they needed, and now the war is over are we
going to get everything we should get in this
time of peace? I think it is about time that
the men who are running this country began
to realize that the war is over and that money
matters are important to the people of this
country. During the war people did not mind
paying heavy taxes, but now it is time that
we did our best to reduce the tax burden,
especially on our working classes. They are
the people whose labour produces the bulk
of our national wealth, and they should be
allowed to retain at least a part of what they
produce. If we continue to increase taxes
there will be no incentive left for our young
people. In order to preserve a democratic
government and country we must make it
possible for Canadians to maintain proper
standards of living and save something from
their earnings.
Unless I can be satisfied by explanations
made in committee I shall vote against this
bill.
Hon. Lucien Moraud: Honourable senators,
may I emphasize one point, which I think
has special application to my city and other
municipalities in the same part of Quebec?
They are populated mostly by people who
have come in from the country, people who
have had a lot to do with land and who, when
they accumulate a little spare money, invest
it in land. I believe that the period of the last
war was the first time in the history of my
city when ordinary people there invested in
government bonds. In general the people are
thrifty, and when a man has been able to

DECEMBER 7. 1949
save a little money he will build a house
which will not only accommodate his family
but also provide a small income. A person
who wishes to borrow money for building
purposes usually applies to a lending company. The caisses populaires, of which I
believe my honourable friend from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) is the head, bave
been established principally for the purpose
of making mortgage loans to such people.
When a man builds or acquires a property
in this way he uses the income tax depreciation allowance as part of his repayment to
the caisse populaire or small insurance company which made him a loan.
Section 7 of the bill would discourage these
people from saving for the purpose of building
houses, and they would not be much interested in saving for any other purpose, such
as investing in stocks or bonds. Therefore
I urge that the section be amended so as to
protect not only farmers and fishermen, but
also people having small investments in
houses.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I should like to ask for some free advice
from the senator who explained the bill
(Hon. Mr. Hayden). In my city of Levis there
is an old family corporation which has been
operating a machine shop for eighty years.
In 1931 business was very poor, as many
honourable senators will remember, and the
company was unable to continue without
financial assistance. At that time it was
impossible to sell the plant at any price.
Application for a loan was made to our
caisse populaire, and in order to provide
employment for the workmen we reorganized
the company and lent it $25,000. Now the
plant is doing well and has 67 employees.
The head of the company is becoming old and
expects to sell out to his employees next year
at $50,000. Of course, the building and
machinery have long since been depreciated
100 per cent. What will happen if this section 7 is passed? I am afraid that it will
diminish his estate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The simple answer is
that if this plan of depreciation goes into
force the capital value of a property will be
established as of January 1, 1949, at the
original cost, less depreciation that has been
taken. The only way in which a person could
avoid the incidence of the act would be by not
coming under the Act. If the company in
Levis charged no further depreciation after
the lst of January, 1949, it would not be subject to this new plan-and there is no reason
why it should be subject to it if the property
has been fully depreciated.
Perhaps the honourable senator from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) will permit me to
correct a statement that he made. This plan

of depreciation deals with what is called
depreciable property, and that does not
include land. So the price of land would not
enter into the calculations for purposes of
depreciation under this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
REPORTING OF PROCEEDINGS IN COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: I would suggest to
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that if he wishes to have the proceedings of the committee reported and
printed there should be a special motion
authorizing that.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Should that motion be
made in committee, Mr. Speaker?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) will make
the motion in committee.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the motion is
passed by the committee, it will have to be
approved by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, may I have
permission to make the motion now?
The Hon.

the Speaker: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move that the proceedings before the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
with respect to Bill 176, an Act to amend the
Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act,
be taken down in shorthand and transcribed;
that the committee be authorized to print
500 copies in English and 200 copies in French
of its proceedings on the bill, and that Rule
100 be suspended in relation to the said
printing.
The motion was agreed to.
MARITIME COAL PRODUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading, Bill 217, an Act to assist producers
of coal in the Atlantic Maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has asked the
honourable gentleman from Margaree Forks
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan) to handle this bill.
Hon. Donald MacLennan moved the second
reading of the bill.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, I have
listened to such a spate of eloquence today
that I do not propose to take much time to
explain this bill.
I apprehend that each
honourable member could, by reading the
bill, understand it now just as well as or
better than he will after my explanation.
The purpose of the bill is to enable the
government to make loans to an amount not
exceeding $10 million to the coal mining
industry in the Maritime Provinces.
The
Dominion Steel and Coal Company produces
about 80 per cent of the total output in that
area, and I surmise that the major portion
of the loans will go to that company. The bill
provides that no producer may receive a loan
of more than two-thirds of the cost of the
project in respect of which it is made. The
producers will have to furnish the money
for the other third.
Honourable senators may have observed
that in the other place-in my younger days
that terrn referred to nether regions-there
was little if any objection to this bill. In
view of the need for the measure, I do not
anticipate much opposition in this house.
The money borrowed is to be returned to
the government at the rate of 30 cents a
ton of coal sold from any mine on which
borrowed money has been expended. Loans
shall bear interest at a rate based on the
average interest return yielded by government bonds, and are to be repaid within
fifteen years. If a producer wishes to pay a
thousand dollars of the principal sum in any
one year, that amount will be regarded as
depreciation and be tax free.
That, honourable senators, covers the main
provisions of the bill.
The bill is made
necessary by the high cost of producing coal
in the Maritime provinces. May I give the
comparative cost of production in the Maritime provinces and in four American states
that compete with us? It must be remembered that 87 per cent of the coal in the
Maritime area is sub-marine. Some mines
in Cape Breton are at this moment four miles
under the sea. I think the Act regulating
coal mines in Nova Scotia permits operations
five miles under the sea, provided there is
for safety purposes a coverage of about 4,000
feet. Costs of mining and transporting coal
in the states of West Virginia, Kentucky,
Pennsylvania and Ohio are much lower than
in the Maritime provinces. For instance, one
man in the States can handle fifty tons of
coal a day, whereas in the Maritime provinces
the average is only ten tons. Assuming the
wage rate to be the same in both countries,
that means the labour cost in the Maritimes
is approximately five times higher than in
the States.
The daily production per man in Nova
Scotia during 1948 was 2.19 tons, and in New

Brunswick 2 -22 tons; the production per man
by our competitors in West Virginia was
5 -61 tons, Kentucky 5 08, Pennsylvania 5 -28
and Ohio 6-77.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask my honourable friend if the daily production is higher
in the United States mines because the men
there are better than those in the Nova Scotia
mines?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The Nova Scotians are
the very best.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Did you ever hear
of a bad man in Nova Scotia?
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I recall that during
the First World War the mines in the United
States produced coal at the rate of $1.10 per
ton, when it was costing Canadian producers
$3.50 per ton. In the States they do not
mine coal as we do in the Maritimes, they
simply quarry it. They can take a great deal
more coal, but the pressure from the surface
on the seam under the sea is such that they
must leave a lot more coal to keep the roof
up. I do not know whether any honourable
senator would like to ask any questions about
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is meant by "carrying out a project"? What project?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I think you will find
the explanation in the bill: Section 3 states:
Subject to the provisions of this Act and with
the approval of the Governor in Council, the minister out of unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund may, in accordance with
an agreement between the minister and a coal
producer, make a loan te the coal producer for
the purpose of carrying out a project, but no
loan shall exceed two-thirds of the cost, as determined by the minister, of the project in respect of
which it is made.

"The project in respect of which it is made"
is the installation of modern machinery in a
mine. I believe that this is entirely for the
purpose of equipping mines with the most
modern machinery.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am glad my honourable
friend mentioned that point. I should like to
ask him a question. It is unfortunate, of
course, that the cost of producing coal in
Nova Scotia is so much higher than in the
United States. As I understand the bill,
$10 million may be loaned, as the honourable
senator has said, to purchase up-to-date
machinery. What I am curious to know is
whether this amount of relief or assistance
will provide a permanent solution of a problem that to me seems to be almost insoluble.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The Coal Commission
which was appointed some years ago recommended this grant, and the Coal Board now

DECEMBER 7, 1949

recommends it, stating that by installing
modern machinery the coal can be mined
very much more cheaply, and as a consequence will be competitive with the American
product.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Without further assistance?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Without further
assistance. Also, mark you, the minister says
that one purpose of granting this loan is to
do away with the subventions which have
been given to the railroads for carrying the
coal at a cheaper rate to Quebec and Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Oh, no, you will not be
able to do that. Maritime producers will not
be able to compete with Pennsylvania.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: At least the loan will
help to reduce the amount of the subventions.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: We shall never be able
to compete with Pennsylvania and other
American states which are near Ontario.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I don't know about
that. The idea expressed by the minister was
that this loan was calculated to at least
reduce the subventions now granted to the
railways for carrying Maritimes' coal. Let us
hope that that will be the effect. Modern
machinery is revolutionizing coal mining. I
have seen illustrations of the machines at
work. The coal, instead of being dug with
picks, is taken out by a machine, without the
aid of manpower, and as the coal falls from
the face it drops on a conveyor belt which
takes it to a chute where it is loaded in boxes
to be hauled to the surface. The project is
to mechanize the coal mines of the Maritime
Provinces through the installation of machinery of that kind.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

DOMINION-PROVINCIAL TAX RENTAL
AGREEMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 215, an Act to amend the
Dominion-Provincial Tax Rental Agreements
Act, 1947.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
to amend in a few particulars the DominionProvincial Tax Rental Agreements Act of
1947. Honourable senators will remember

that the Act of 1947 provided that such provinces of Canada as so desired might enter
agreements with the Dominion Government
by which the provinces would abandon in
favour of the Dominion Government certain
tax fields, including the income tax on
corporations. But by section 3 of that Act it
was provided that notwithstanding such a
province might have entered into an agreement with the Dominion for that purpose, it
could nevertheless, without violating the
agreement, levy a tax of 5 per cent on the
corporate income of companies within that
province.
Now, by section 7 of the Act of 1947 the
federal government undertook to pay to the
government of any province, whether it made
an agreement with the dominion under this
Act or not, 50 per cent of the income tax
which the federal government deprived from
companies generating and distributing electricity, gas, or steam in the province.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Does this bill apply to
all provinces?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, regardless of
whether they make an agreeement with the
Dominion or not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does it apply to the provincially-owned hydros?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No; just to companies
which are subject to income tax and from
which the Dominion Government levies
income tax.
This payment of 50 per cent under the 1947
Act was subject to the deduction of certain
provincial and municipal taxes on royalties
levied by the province upon the company
concerned, except for this 5 per cent corporation tax levied under section 3 of the Act by
any province which had made a tax agreement with the Dominion Government.
Section 1 of this bili is designed to extend
these benefits to the provinces which have
not made tax agreements with the Dominion
Government under the 1947 Act. Those two
provinces, as honourable senators know, are
Ontario and Quebec. So, in the result, section
1 of this bill will mean this: an amount up to
5 per cent on corporate income, levied by the
province of Ontario or Quebec on electrical
distribution companies operating in these
provinces, will no longer be deducted from
the 50 per cent of the Dominion income tax
on the companies concerned, and which the
Dominion now remits to these provinces.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: There are none in
Ontario, are there?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think there are some
privately-owned companies in northern and
western Ontario.

SENATE

The remaining sections of the bill are not
of great importance. They provide that this
benefit shall accrue in the case of a parent
corporation which owns a subsidiary that
carries on the actual distribution of electricity. They also provide that certain returns
be made to the Minister of National Revenue
by power companies, with a view to enabling
the minister to establish the amount of taxes,
and so on, under this Act.

CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:

Second reading of Bill 216, an Act to encourage
the Construction and Conversion of Vessels in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honouralble senators,
the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) had asked the honourable senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo)
to handle this bill.
Hon. J. G. Fogo moved the second reading
of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, as intimated
in the Speech from the Throne, this measure
is introduced to bring some assistance to the
shipbuilding industry of Canada. The maintenance of a shipbuilding industry in this
country is of great importance from an
economic standpoint, but it is of even greater
importance from the standpoint of national
security.
I believe I can shorten my remarks by
referring to the report of June 30, 1949, of
the Canadian Maritime Commission.
On
pages 46 and 47 of this report the commission
sets out its conclusions as to the reasons for
the desirability of maintaining a Canadian
shipbuilding industry. The main reason is
national security. It has been suggested that
in occasion of emergency we might look to
the United Kingdom and even to Europe to
supply us with ships, but I think the considered opinion is that in the event of war
United Kingdom and European shipyards
might be vulnerable.
This industry has had a rather fluctuating history. It was at a very low ebb prior
to the war of 1914-18, and when sinkings due

to submarine activities were numerous, it
was found necessary to build up a shipbuilding industry in Canada. Naturally, when
the country had to undertake such a job
during wartime and under the pressure of
emergency, the expense involved was much
greater than it would be to maintain an
industry in peacetime.
In
the interval
between 1918 and 1939, our shipbuilding
industry was very materially reduced, and
as a result of the outbreak of war in 1939

I quote from the report of the Maritime
Commission:
On two occasions Canada has succeeded at considerable cost in rebuilding both industries, and
physically it might be possible to do so again. The
main argument against the disestablishment of the
two industries lies in the loss of trained seamen
and skilled artisans. This is especially true in the
case of the shipyards where a body of highlytrained technicians and artisans now exists. The
danger of time-lag must be recognized.
It not
only takes time to create facilities but also to
assemble trained workmen with the necessary skills
and it is possible that such time may not be available in another emergency.

Honourable senators, I will not quote further from this report, but I would commend

it to you for reading.

I think you will find

it a very useful compendium of information

about the shipbuilding industry of this
country.
Honourable senators, this bill relates particularly to the shipbuilding industry, and
provides for assistance in a way that might
be called "special depreciation" in the case
of vessels built and converted in Canada.
Our shipbuilding costs are actually about 25
per cent higher than costs in Britain, and so
some inducement must be offered to encourage the building of ships in our own yards.
Consequently, this bill permits the owner of
a vessel built in our own yards to write
off depreciation at a rate not exceeding
33 per cent per year. That is to say, he
may take 33 per cent off each year, or the
whole amount in three years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If he were to sell the
vessel would he be subject to this new
income tax?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Yes, that is also covered
in this bill. At one time the rate of depreciation was 4 per cent, but it was recently raised

to 6 per cent. One of the defects in the present
systemi is that even in a loss-year the shipowner must take 50 per cent of the depreciation.

Therefore, he would have to take 3

per cent of the depreciation even if he had
no profit. Under this proposed legislation he
will not be required to do that; he may take

long, 42 feet wide and with a draft of 14
feet. While it is true that some ships are
idle in Halifax and Vancouver, their idleness is the result of extraordinary conditions
brought about by the exchange situation and
other factors. One of these is the American
government's restriction on the use of foreign
ships in the carriage of goods under the
United States Foreign Assistance Act, which
provides, if I remember correctly, that at least
50 per cent of goods exported from the United
States by water must be carried in United
States bottoms. Another factor is the serious
decline in ocean freight. The competition
is terribly keen and our operating costs are
comparatively high. Conversion of some ships
that are now idle, into faster ships which
could be operated more cheaply, should
enable us to meet competition better and
benefit from ocean freights as well as from
carriage on inland and coastal waters.
I commend the second reading of the bill
to honourable members of this house.
Hon. L. Moraud: Honourable senators, I
have only a few words to say.
I think the bill is a step in the right direction, but I am quite sure that it does not go
far enough. Beyond the provisions contained
in this bill, I understand that the government has decided on a policy of subsidizing
the ship industry. Even the allowance for
depreciation wilil affect only the ships that
are operating, because ships that are idle
would have no operating profits.
I think our problern is to correct the present
condition of idleness that exists in the shipbuilding industry. During the war there were
2,000 men trained in the shipbuilding plant
in the city of Quebec, and they became very
skilful. Today in that same plant there are
only 40 men at work. A similar situation
exisits in Levis, where there are two plants
practically idle. I am told that a good many
of our sea-going vessels do not operate
because they cannot compete with the ships
of other countries. They are either not fast
enough or their crews are better paid than
those on the ships of other countries, thereby
increasing the cost of operation.
Even the granting of depreciation may not
cure the probler of lidleness in our shipyards.
The government seems reluctant to giving
direct subsidies, and its indirect subsidies
will have to go much further to keep plants
from being dismantled. In order to compete
with other nations of the world, Canada
should be building ships of the modern and
faster types.
I repeat that in Quebec city only 40 out
of 2,000 skilled workers are employed in the
plant today, and the two large shipyards at

Levis have no contracts, and' will not have
any unless the government comes to their
rescue.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I am always amused when the Liberals, who
are always talking about free trade, bring in
protective measures. When this bill was being
explained I was watching the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), who
has delivered some great orations on the
Liberal policy of free trade.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You never heard me in
your life.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The bill before us is a
measure of pure protection-a good old Conservative doctrine-to provide trained men
for times of emergency. I recall that thirty
years ago prominent Conservatives were
making speeches along the lines of protection
for industry in this country.
If England can build ships at 25 per cent
cheaper than Canada can, why do we not buy
more frorn her and enable her to buy our
food? Japan could build ships for us at a
quarter of our cost, and she is anxious to do
it in return for some of our products. Let
each country produce the commodities best
suited to it and exchange them for the
specialties of other countries. Let us buy
ships from Japan and England.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And coal from the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Horner: In this way we could buy
ships cheaper than we could build them, and
in return we could give our grain and livestock, which Canada produces in abundance.
Canada's whole trade system is, in my opinion, operating backwards.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I can scarcely let the last remarks pass without offering a word or two by way of contradiction. If we think Japan can produce ships
at a quarter of the cost at which we can build
them, we are overlooking the fact that British
Columbia built ships during the recent war at
costs comparable to those of the Clyde. As
a matter of fact, the cost of shipbuilding in
Vancouver and New Westminster was small
compared with the cost in any other part of
Canada. During the war another senator and
I were members of the War Expenditures
Committee whose duty it was to visit every
shipbuilding plant in Canada, including
Quebec.
When anyone says that Britain can build
ships at 25 per cent less than the cost in
Canada, that statement does not apply to the
Pacific coast. Out there we have experienced
men who came from the Clyde shipyards,
and their remarkable record during the war
would be hard to beat. I do not think that

DECEMBER 7, 1949
even Japan could compete with the Pacific
coast in the matter of shipbuilding costs;
and I am quite sure we can build ships
cheaper than they can be built in the Clyde
shipyards.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: And cheaper than in the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Certainly cheaper than in
the United States.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
whether the assistance offered by this bill
will enable the shipping industry of this
country to export ships to other countries, or
are the new ships to be used only for our
own trade purposes? If the shipping industry
is to be as successf ul as it should be, I think
it should be looked at from the same point of
view as any other industry, namely, with a
view to producing for sale outside of this
country.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: The answer is that
charity begins at home. We should first build
a fleet which could compete with those of
other countries. I am sure the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) would
agree that one of the main reasons why so
many sea-going ships are idle today is that
they cannot compete effectively with the
ships of other countries.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is it the assumption that
an additional supply of ships would promote
trade, or that an additional volume of trade
would promote the building of ships? I think
that is the equation that has to be considered
in connection with this bill.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 221, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The honourable leader
of the house has asked the honourable senator
from Ottawa to explain this bill.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
very brief and simple in its purview. It
relates to items 1215 and 1216 of Schedule "C"
of the Customs Tariff Act. Item 1215, as set

forth in the bill, relates to the entry into
Canada of used cars and trucks. Item 1216
relates to the entry into Canada of used
aircraft.
During the past several years, particularly
during last year, there have been a number
of applications for the entry of such equipment into Canada, but there is no authority
under which relief can be granted. In the
past year or two a number of cases of hardships have been brought to the attention of
the Department of National Revenue. I have in
my hand an analysis of some 150 applications
for relief in this connection. In addition,
there were recorded in the department some
twenty-nine written inquiries relating to the
entry into Canada, of used equipment, mainly
from the United States, but also from abroad.
This bill does not interfere in any way with
the ordinary course of trade and commerce
between the countries. In the explanatory
note the classes of goods affected are
enumerated as follows:
Automobiles acquired by Canadians returning to
Canada after a substantial period of residence in
a foreign country; gifts of automobiles to religious
institutions or clergy engaged in religious or welfare
work; trucks and aircraft imported as part of the
equipment of United States firms engaged in exploratory or development work in the Alberta oil
fields; special type aircraft not available in Canada
for use in prospecting or in the transportation of
supplies to remote areas.

"A substantial period of residence", I
assume, would be the better part of a year
or maybe more than a year. I have here
some examples. Fifty applications for entry
were made by persons who had acquired used
cars while in temporary residence in other
countries. Twenty-three of the applicants
were students who were taking post-graduate
or specialized courses and who had resided
in the foreign country anywhere from one to
three years-several were DVA-subsidized.
Their reason for wanting to bring in their
cars with their other personal effects was to

save family transportation costs and to use

their vehicles in Canada. Some real cases of
hardship were created by the prohibition, and
the department's only alternative was to permit temporary entry of the vehicle, which
necessitated its exportation later and its sale
abroad. Great inconvenience and financial
loss resulted in most cases. Nineteen workers
who had obtained employment in the United
States, and who bought cars to travel back
and forth to work, wished to bring their cars
into Canada for reasons similar to those of
the students. The difference between these
two classes was largely one of time-time
spent in the foreign country-the student
being bound to stay at least one year, whereas
the workers usually remained on]y for

456

months. Then reference is made to a number
of other cases which, if the Senate desires,
could be explored or made the subject of
questions in committee tomorrow.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: How will the system
work? The Governor in Council may permit
the importation. I suppose the applications
for entry have to be made to the Customs
Department.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes. The Department of
National Revenue will receive the applications. The amendments merely provide that
the Governor in Council may permit importation in certain cases or classes of cases.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: So an order in council
would be needed in each case.

Hon. Mr. Euler: By order in council anything can be admitted into this country.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think the purpose of
the bill is to bring the items in the schedule
into line with provisions which may be made
under order in council.

Conservation.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have asked my government colleague, the
honourable senator from Edmonton, to handle
this bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. A. MacKinnon moved second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, may I thank
my leader in this chamber for giving me
this opportunity to make my first speech in
the Senate? As I returned only at noon

today from a trip to the West Indies, made
necessary by government requirements, my
remarks on this bill will be somewhat shorter
and more formal than they otherwise would
be. I left Barbados yesterday morning and
arrived in Ottawa at noon today, and have
not had much opportunity to prepare a full
explanation of the bill.
Honourable senators, it is with considerable personal pleasure that I move second
reading of the Canada Forestry Bill. This
measure represents a major forward step in
conserving a great natural resource of this
country. It contains proposals on which
there is a very wide measure of agreement
throughout Canada. It deals with a subject
to which I gave close study and attention
during the period I served as Minister of
Mines and Resources. The groundwork of
this particular legislation was firmly constructed by my predecessors in that portfolio.
I doubt if there is today any subject in the
field of public administration in Canada
which commands greater unanimity than
that of forest conservation. Over the years
there has been a steady growth in public
awareness of, and interest in, forest maintenance. It is realized on all sides that our
forests are not only a basic resource but a
national as well as a provincial trust.
In its 1945 proposals to the DominionProvincial Conference, the federal government, as part of a recommended public

measure now before this chamber offers a
logical approach towards the provision of
a statutory authority for the proper discharge
of those federal obligations.
This bill contemplates two things. First,
it provides for the establishment of national
forests or forest experimental areas on lands
belonging to the Crown in the right of
Canada; and second, it ewpowers the
federal government to enter into agreements
with the provinces for a nu-mber of purposes
relating to forest conservation.

SENATE

There is no question whaýtever of any
invasion of provincial rights or jurisdiction
being involved in this proposed legislation. In
essence, this bill forms a basis for joint
action by the dominion and the provinces in
the forestry field. The measure is purely
permissive in nature, and contains no onesided power of expropriation. Under this
bill it is nat intended ýthat any forest experimental area or national forest shall be established contrary ta the wishes of a province.
As a matter of policy, the concurrence of the
province concerned will first be obtained. It
was while I was Minister of Mines and
Resources that government authorities in all
the provinces were given an opportunity ta
carefully study our proposals. Far from raising any objection ta this federal plan, the
provinces generally voiced whole-hearted and
unanimous approval.
With the increasing need for maintaining
and developing our forest resources, it has
become apparent that ithe existing Dominion
Forest Reserves and Parks Act no longer has
any application. It fails therefore, ta serve
as a proper medium for carrying out the
policy and responsibilities of the federal
government in forestry matters.
The measure now submitted brings the
statutory authority up to date and in line
with present-diay requirements. It provides
a proper framework for building a national
forestry policy, which is badly needed. Above
all, it is designed ta promote working co-operation in this field and between the provinces, the forestry industry and the dominion.
It provides the foundation for effective
national action when such action is necessary
and desirable.
I cannot speak too highly of the work and
personnel of the Dominion Forest Service,
which operates research laboratories in
Ottawa and Vancouver, and participates with
private industry in operating *a pulp and
paper research laboratory in Montreal. It
also operates forest experimental stations in
five provinces. It has gathered forestry
information of great benefit ta the provinces
and the industry and, of course, ta the federal
government. New techniques and equipment
have been developed. The Dominion Forest
Service is, in fact, making a permanent contribution ta Canadian prosperity. Under this
bill its opportunities for service will definitely
be widened, with a corresponding benefit to
Canada as a whole.
Whether for the purpose of watershed
protection, tourist attraction, fish and game
conservation or forest products wealth,
Canada's forests are among her most
important possessions. Few industries can
do without wood products.

In Alberta, my home province, the irrigation farmer is vitally concerned in the protection of mountain forests, as they slow down
and distribute evenly the iannual run-off from
melting snow and glaciers. Actually, forests
on the east slope of the Rockies govern the
flow of virtually every river watering the
western plains. It is essential in the in-terests
of national well-being that the forests of this
country be developed, so that their yield will
be continuous and sufficiently abundant, ta
meet nat only the internal needs of Canada
but the requirements of our foreign trade.
We need ta exercise care and wise judgment
in protecting this great primary resource, and
in organizing the production and harvesting
of our timber wealth. This is a task which
requires large expenditures of time, money
and skill, but we could nat make a better
investment in the future of this nation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I

welcome this proposed legislation, even at
this late date, when it is like shutting the
stable door after the horse has been stolen.
Some time ago I gave some facts about
Canada's advancement as a nation. One thing
I forgot ta mention was the wastefulness
shown by the federal government in its control of natural resources. Northern Saskatchewan has nat today anything like the stand
of spruce timber it once had. This natural
resource was largely wasted or given away
by the federal government before it came
under provincial jurisdiction. There was no
regulation as ta the size of trees which could
or could not be cut, with the result that many
millions of feet of lumber were removed from
that area and some people in Milwaukee
became millionaires. Railroads were built ta
serve the big operators, and one of these railroads ran ta Big River, where a -huge sawmill was put up. The huge stands were
appropriated; the smaller ones were left scattered here and there. That is how the operators conducted their business before the era
of control of our natural resources.
Contrast this with the practice in Sweden,
Denmark and Germany. In those countries
they have, and have had for from fifty to
seventy years, planned systems for the conservation of their forests. Every Swede I
have talked ta has been horrified at the lack
in Canada of any policy of reforestation. As
I understand the Swedish rule, if one tree
is cut, two trees must be planted; and cutting
must take place within six inches of the
ground. But within a few miles of the city
of Ottawa you can find huge stumps, the
best part of the tree, standing three or four
feet high. I talked ta one Swede who has
been quite successful in Saskatchewan, and

DECEMBER 8. 1949

he told me that he would have been better
off had he remained in Sweden, as his
brothers did. He said, "I could have lived
off my limit of timberland". He went on to
explain how his brothers in Sweden had
profited by operating in the national forests.
Each farmer was allowed the revenue from
so many acres of forest, but he worked under
government supervision. He could not deplete
the property; he had to re-plant. This policy
had been so profitable that today the authorities were deriving a good revenue from their
forests.
It is much to be regretted that some fifty
years ago we did not adopt a policy of planning for the preservation of our forests. In
the northern part of Saskatchewan there is
a very large area ideally suited to the growth
of timber, but good for no other purpose.
No attempts were made to clear the land, as
fire-guards, every six, or twenty, or one
hundred miles. Consequently, fires have
raged over hundreds of miles of that country.
At one time there was a regulation in Saskatchewan to "limb tops and burn brush", but
as far as I know it was never enforced, and
when a fire occurred in that area, not only
the slash and the trees but the very ground
was burnt. If the coming of this bill means,
even at this late date, that we are going to
do something to preserve our forests, I am
strongly in favour of it.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: I rise simply for the
purpose of expressing my appreciation of
this measure, and my thanks to the government for introducing it. I do so as a representative of the forest products industry. I
can assure the honourable gentleman who
introduced the legislation that the industry
from one end of Canada to the other will
receive it with the warmest possible approval
and endorsation. One of the greatest difficulties we have encountered in our work, either
as members of an industrial association, or
of the Canadian Forestry Association-which,
honourable members realize, has done a
wonderful work educationally in bringing to
the Canadian people a realization of the
importance of supervising and preserving our
forests- has been the conflict of authority
between the provinces and the dominion, and
the difficulty of getting the representatives
of the two jurisdictions together for the purpose of pursuing a grand forestry supervision
program, national in scope.
The introduction of the bill has made this
a very happy day for me, for it means that
we have made, at least, a start, and, I believe,
a start in the right direction. In my judgment
no measure of greater importance than this
has been introduced in parliament during the
present session. It is so important and farreaching that I regret that it was found neces-

sary to delay it until this late date, for I
know that many of us would have liked to
have gone a little more deeply into its provisions. We cannot do anything about this
now, except to say that we heartily approve
of the measure and hope it will bring forth
blessings for this land.
A large proportion of our population of
every class is dependent upon our forests,
and it is difficult to realize that Canada has
lost more timber through fire and insect pests
than has ever been cut by the axe during
the long history of the lumbering industry
of this nation. This should indicate something of the tremendous possibilities that can
result from preserving our forest lands by
the fighting of fires and the destroying of
insect pests. Honourable senators, I want
to say that I welcome this measure most
heartily.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator who sponsored this legislation (Hon.
Mr. MacKinnon), if he knows whether the
government intends to carry on any reforestation of dominion Crown lands under this
Act? If so, has he any information as to
whether the government will set up nurseries,
or will co-operate in carrying out the work
of provincial nurseries already in existence?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I am not in a position
to reply in detail to the question just asked
by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid); but the measure will
give authority to the dominion government
to carry on a program of that nature. It will
also empower the dominion government to
co-operate with the provincial governments
in carrying on this kind of work.
I was most thankful to hear the remarks
of the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill), because it was in
his province that I saw this work being done
in a successful way.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

LUMBER INDUSTRY OF THE MARITIMES
INQUIRY AND

DISCUSSION

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the inquiry
of the Honourable Senator Burchili that he will cal
the attention of the Senate to the condition of the
lumber industry in the Maritime Provinces and wilI
inquire of the government if they are aware that a
recent inquiry from the United Kingdom for 50,000t

SENATE
standards is restricted to offers from producers in
Western Canada and the northwestern United
States.

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am happy to have the opportunity
of making a brief reply to the inquiry which
my honourable friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) brought before this house
in such a detailed and interesting fashion.
I may say that no one is better qualified
to bring this subject to our attention than is
the honourable senator from Northumberland.
The interest that he has taken in the welfare
of the lumbering industry bas long been a
characteristic of his activities.
What my
honourable friend says about the value of
the Maritime lumbering industry applies
largely to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
a portion of eastern Quebec. He bas pointed
out that for many years the United Kingdom
market for long lumber has been a valuable
market for the product of the area that I have
referred to.
In the years just before the outbreak of war
the annual export of lumber to the United
Kingdom from that area was approximately
250 million board feet. During the war and
up to 1947 exports increased, and in 1947
amounted to 320 million feet. But in the
next year, 1948, they declined to 60 million
feet. It is hoped that this year we shall ship
to the United Kingdom approximately 130
million feet-roughly twice the 1948 quantity
but only half the pre-war average.
As my honourable friend from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) pointed out, there
has been a change in the method of indicating
United Kingdom requirements for Eastern
Canadian lumber. Prior to the war it was
the general practice for United Kingdom
buyers to intimate in the fall of every year
what their requirements would be for the
coming year; but last year there was a change
from that pre-war pattern and the requirements were not made known until much later.
So not only is the industry confronted with
a reduction in demand from the United Kingdom, but it is not able to lay its plans as
early as formerly for meeting the demand.
In the present year it was not known until
the end of February that the United Kingdom would purchase 90 million board feet
in 1949. and it was even later before an intimation was received that the requirements
would be increased to approximately 130
million board feet.
The problem of course arises out of the
United Kingdom's shortage of dollars and its
dependence to some degree upon the E.C.A.
for financial assistance. So far as I am aware,
there is no lack of willingness to buy. Our
prices are competitive, though perhaps less
so since the recent devaluation of the pound.
Undoubtedly United Kingdom requirements

of all kinds from the dollar area will be carefully considered and screened by the E.C.A.,
which is providing so much financial assistance. I would point out that there are three
possible sources of payment: money paid for
goods sold us by the United Kingdom, money
provided by our own loans, and money
received through E.C.A. assistance.
And
while I have no definite information on the
subject, I do not doubt that the whole program of United Kingdom importations from
the dollar area, including both Canada and
the United States, is subject to careful
screening. In his inquiry my honourable
friend from Northumberland pointed out that
there was a recent inquiry from the United
Kingdom for 50,000 standards from the West
Coast. That at least indicates that the United
Kingdom is not disregarding this area as a
source of supply for at least a part of its
lumber requirements. The inquiry contemplated delivery in the first six months of
1950, and also, I understand, it contained a
clause that on the buyer's option delivery
might be taken in the first three months. It is
hoped that this indicates a staggered program
of importations, and that the 1949 pattern
of East Coast exports will be followed in the
latter part of 1950. The Department of Trade
and Commerce is constantly pressing on the
United Kingdom the advantage of making
known its requirements at the earliest possible date, but we cannot be sure at the
moment that a decision will be made in an
earlier month this year than last year. I can
only say that the department feels reasonably
optimistic as to the immediate future.
I regret that at the moment I cannot say
anything more definite than that, but I would
point out that at present the United States
market is strong and prospects for 1950 are
good. The Canadian exports of lumber to the
United States-I am speaking now of exports
from all parts of Canada, for I have no figures
as to Eastern Canada alone-are approximately 475 million board feet a year. In
1948, as a result of good demand and also of
decreased exports to the United Kingdomwhich probably made more lumber available
for the United States market-the exports to
the United States increased to 730 million
board feet. During the first nine months of
this year there was a decline, through
lessened United States demand. It is probable
also that increased exports to the United
Kingdom reduced the amount of lumber
available for shipment to the United States.
The figures I have given are for the first
nine months of the year, but I am advised
that the American market is much better
now. I would point out that the devaluation
of the dollar gives our producers an advantage on the United States market.

DECEMBER 8, 1949
I feel that our producers in the Maritime
Provinces are bound to give more attention
to the United States market in future, and
many of them are preparing to do so. As
my honourable friend from Northumberland
knows, the United States trade calls for more
manufacture and processing than do many of
the United Kingdom markets. Exporters face
changing conditions, and it is almost inevitable that some consideration will be given to
these factors.
Eastern Canadian spruce has been sold for
a long time on the United Kingdom markets,
particularly in the Liverpool and Bristol
Channel areas, and I believe that when
normal conditions return the United Kingdom
will continue to buy this lumber. However,
competition is bound to be keen and our
costs have gone up. It is difficult, and indeed
it would be undesirable, for the lumber
industry in Eastern Canada to return to the
pre-war standard of wages, and the only
answer I can see to the industry's problems
is a greater return for its products, through
better manufacture and more careful grading.
The honourable gentleman from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) has long urged
upon the industry the desirability of this
course, and under his excellent leadership
much progress has been made. If as a result
of the difficult times now faced by the
industry this program is given further
impetus, it will be one bright spot in what
is otherwise a very trying situation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable
leader permit me to ask a question? Are the
British buying lumber and other goods from
this country apart from dollar control and
apart from the private buying such as was
done prior to the outbreak of war? In my
opinion, if they are it would be interesting
indeed to find out the prices being paid to
Canadian producers and the prices charged
for the goods when sold in Britain.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My understanding is
that the purchase of lumber in Canada, on
both the West Coast and the East Coast, is
done entirely through government buyers.
There is no private buying at all.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know that during the war
British concerns bought articles in Canada
and sold them to the British people at
increased prices. If that matter were looked
into, it might be an important factor governing our trade.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
NATIONAL DEFENCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill J-5 (as amended), an Act respecting National Defence.
He said: I should like to refer to the fact
that the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) suggested that
when this order was called he would like
to move that the house go into Committee of
the Whole on the bill in order to consider
certain amendments. If that is still the wish
of the honourable gentleman, I shall have no
particular objection, but I might point out
to him that although we have completed our
work in connection with this bill, it is not
intended to proceed with it in the other house,
so that automatically it will die and will have
to be re-introduced next session. Under these
circumstances, unless the honourable gentleman is keenly anxious to proceed at this
time, he may consent to withdraw his suggestion, and, if he so wishes, bring it forward
again when the bill comes before us next
session.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, of
course there is no real reason for going on
now, and I accept the suggestion of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and
shall not move the house into Committee of
the Whole on this measure.
I think it may be worth while, however, to
say that what I had in mind was the Court
Martial Appeal Board which is to be set up
by the bill. The right of appeal from that
board to the Supreme Court of Canada is
provided for, but only if there is dissent in
the Court Martial Appeal Board and if the
appeal is approved by the Attorney-General
of Canada.
So there are two hurdles to
jump. I intended to point out that under
those circumstances the right of appeal is
an illusory one and without any element of
reality. I intended to move to strike out the
words "dissent in the Court Martial Appeal
Board", so as to permit of an appeal whenever it shall be approved by the AttorneyGeneral of Canada.
Another section which I find objectionable
is the one which makes it a criminal offence
for anyone to assist, harbour or conceal an
officer or man who is a deserter or absentee,
and which places on the individual so charged
the obligation of proving to the court that
he did not know that the man was a deserter
or absentee. This is going very much further
than the law has ever gone before. It differs
in this respect from the Criminal Code, which
requires that knowledge must be shown. I
think that a provision is too drastic which
makes a deserter or a mac who is absent
without leave a pariah against whom every
man's hand is set, and which penalizes the
person who may chance to aid him-not to
desert or to remain a deserter, but in any
way at all.
I have mentioned the two subjects I had
in mind because I hope that when this bill
again comes before us these will have been
reconsidered and will not appear in the
measure then to be presented to us.
I agree that there is nothing to be gained
now by going into committee, and I have
served my full purpose in making this
explanation.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
MOTION WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Honourable
be
Mr. Roebuck, that the government
requested to submit to the forthcoming
Dominion-Provincial Conference on the Constitution a draft amendment to the British
North America Act.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators. it is my right and duty to close the
debate on the resolution respecting Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which I
had the honour to move in this chamber on
November 3 last. I counted it then. as I do
now, a great privilege to be associated, in even
the humblest capacity, with the noble sentiments and high resolve expressed in the
declaration which forms the main substance
of my motion. Though tbere bas been some
difference of opinion among the members
of the chamber with regard to the practical
steps which I proposed, every honourable
senator who spoke on this motion concurred
in its general principles and commended the
effort to promote their observance.
For the many kind references that have
been made by so many of the speakers, I am
truly grateful. To the senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) I tender my
thanks for having seconded the motion.
Although be expressed some doubts, and suggested a need of further information, his
remarks were not in any way a criticism of
the general trend towards greater freedom
and security. To the senator from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon), whom I see here this
afternoon, I am grateful for having recorded
in Hansard the statement made by the
Canadian delegation of the attitude of the
Canadian Government towards the draft
Declaration of Human Rights when, in
December 1948, Canada voted in the General
Assembly of the United Nations for its
acceptance. As I said on a previous occasion,
the declaration then referred to is practically
identical with the substance of my motion.
Let me draw attention to two or three
sentences of Canada's statement:
We regard this document as one inspired by the
highest ideals; as one which contains a statement
_f a number of noble principles and aspirations of
very great significance which the people of the
worid will endeavour to fulfil.

Canadians believe in these rights and practise
them in their communities. In order that there may
be no misinterpretation of our position on this
subjcct, therefore, the Canadian delegation, having
made its position clear in the cemmittee, will, in
accordance with the understanding I have expressed,
now vote in favour of the resolution in the hope
that it wil! mark a milestone in humanity's upward
narch.

It seems to me regrettable that the honourable senator frorn Cariboo was not able to
sweep away, as did the Canadian delegation
at Lake Success, the mere technical difficulties that stood in the way, and vote for the
resolution now before the house, or announce
his support of it in the hope that the resolution, after a sufficient degree of study and in
due course of time, will "mark a milestone in
humanity's upward march." The honourable
gentleman said this:
Canada generally is in definite agreement with
the aspirations contained in the declaration, and I
am sure all provinces as well as the federal authcrity, wIll d) everything humanly possible to
îimprove present conditions.

In view of these sentiments I find it diflicult
to understand the honourable senator's objection to submitting principles of this high order
to the dominion and provincial delegations,
since he has confidence that they will accept
such principles. But of course I respect his
judgment in that regard, and I assure him
that I will not put him in the position of
voting a:ainst these "noble principles and
aspirations" for any secondary reason-and
I say the same thing to ail other members
of this house.
J should like to pa' the tribute that I really
feel is due to the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) for the eloquence xith which she charmed this house

loveliness of ber thought and presence threw
a spell across the chamber which I shall not
soon forget. To the honourable senator from
Peterborough I say, "Thank you."
in a somevhat different way, I am equally
grateful to the honourable senator from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). He too surrendered to the practical difficulties which
confront this resolution, but in doing so he
gave to this bouse a judgment matured during
t
wo years' service as Chairman of the Joint
Committee of Parliament on Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms. As I recall his
remarks, the honourable senator felt that we
should confine our activities to our own
dominion jurisdiction, and that our first step
should be a declaration of some fundamental
principles upon which we can all agree. Then
be made the following statement, which I
submit is well worthy of repetition:
We should proclaim the right to freedom of conscience, the right to personal freedom and security,
the right to freedom from arbitrary imprisonment

and to a fair trial, the right to free expression and
to free association. We should proclaim the equality
of all before the law. We should also declare that
everyone has an equal right of access to the public
service in our country. Finally, we should add that
all human rights and fundamental freedoms belong
to every person without distinction of any kind,
such as race, colour, sex, language, religious belief
or political opinion.

In my judgment the honourable senator
from New Westminster over-emphasized his
objections, for he opened his speech with an
acceptance, which I have in part quoted, of
the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and he closed with an
acknowledgment that I had carried out the

which, with the indulgence of the house, I
should like to quote.
Mr. Irving Himel, Secretary of the Committee on Human Rights has written me as
follows:
We have heard from both the Civil Liberties
Association of Manitoba, and the Canadian Civil
Liberties Union, Vancouver Branch. They write to
say that their executive has met and endorsed your
resolution.

In a letter bearing the letterhead of the
Toronto Jewish Youth Council, the secretary
writes:
I am public relations chairman of the Toronto
Jewish Youth Council, which represents over 5,000
Jewish youth in Toronto. At a recent Ontario
Jewish Youth Conference held in Toronto, November 5 and 6, there were over a hundred delegates
from all parts of Ontario, from Sudbury to Windsor,
representing well over 10,000 Jewish youth.

A resolution passed by the Council is as
ffollows:
Resolved that we urge the federal government
of Canada to pass a Bill of Rights outlawing racial
and religious discrimination.

Mr. Frederick W. Boorer of the Christian
Science Committee on Publication for Ontario, which represents all the churches of
that denomination, says:
I was pleased to read the report of your motion
in the Senate calling for submission to the
Dominion-Provincial Conference to be held in
January of a "Canadian Bill of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms."
Particularly are we interested in Article 15 pertaining to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion, and more specifically the very important
point you have made in not only guaranteeing one's
freedom to believe in his own individual form of
worship, but also to practice it.

The Civil Liberties Association includes in its

The last letter of a general character to
which I wish to refer is from the Ontario
Federation of Labour, over the signatures of
Joseph MacKenzie, President, George Burt,
Vice-President, S. S. Hughes, Vice-President,
and Cleve Kidd, Secretary-Treasurer. It
reads in part as follows:
The Ontario Federation of Labour (Canadian
Congress of Labour) representing approximately
150,000 trade unionists in the province of Ontario,
for some time has recognized the need for a
Canadian Bill of Rights.
We therefore greet with enthusiasm the motion
introduced into the Senate on October 27 by yourself to amend the British North America Act to
incorporate a "Canadian Bill of Human Rights and

The publicity which this resolution received
in the press, all over Canada, is so volumin-

ous that, if I would, I could not quote it all.
Perhaps it is worth while to read an excerpt
from an editorial written by Mr. B. K. Sandwell, editor of Saturday Night, one of the
most progressive, persistent and faithful
advocates of human rights. Here is what
he says:
The extent and very serious discussion of it by
the upper house, have not been without a great
deal of value. For one thing the motion has
elicited strong expressions of approval frorn labour
organizations and other elements of the public,
extending far beyond the intelligentsia which has
until now provided the chief support for the Bill
of Rights idea. To the principle, indeed, there has
been practically no objection; criticism has been
confined to the method of putting it in operation
and the opportuneness of the occasion which Mr.
Roebuck sought to utilize.

PRIVATE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 222, an Act to amend The
Canadian Red Cross Society Act.
The bill was read the first time.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon.

J. G. Turgeon

moved

the

second

reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, as you know,
the delay in bringing this bill before this
chamber is due to the fact that it has come
only this moment from the other place.
The bill contains several proposed changes.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Has this bill been distributed?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: No, it has just this
moment come from the other place. As a
matter of fact, I have been informed that the
bill was not distributed in the other place
when it was dealt with and finally passed
there yesterday evening.
I read now from section 3:
The said Act is further amended by adding
thereto the following section:
9. The name of the society in the French language
shall be "La Societe canadienne de la CroixRouge."

According to the explanatory note, this
amendment is required to sanction the use of
"La Societe canadienne de la Croix-Rouge" as

the name of the Canadian Red Cross Society
in the French language. I have been informed
that up to the present time the use of the
French title, while being correct and justified, has had no legal foundation.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Will you read the amendment again?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It reads:
The said act is further amended by adding
thereto the following section:
9. The name of the society in the French language
shall be "La Societe canadienne de la CroixRouge".

There are two or three other amendments.
One of these is to remove the limitation which
the present Act imposes upon the value of
property that the Canadian Red Cross
Association may hold. This is necessary,
partly because of the rise in the cost of the

value of land, partly because of the extension
of the Canadian Red Cross Service to our new
province of Newfoundland, and very largely
because of the great extension of the blood
transfusion and other services of the Red
Cross. These are the reasons suggested for
the removal of the ceiling on the value of
property which the Association may hold.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) what the former value was? What was
the limit?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The present Act provides:
The annual value of the real estate held in Canada
by or in trust for the society shall not exceed one
hundred thousand dollars.

Another amendment is for the purpose of
giving increased representation on the central
body to the various governing divisions. The
present section says:
The governing body of the society shall be a
central council, consisting of not more than forty
members appointed or elected in such manner as
may be determined from time to time by the
central council.

Thig has been changed to read:
The governing body of the society shall be a
central council, consisting of not more than sixty
members appointed or elected in such manner as
may be determined from time to time by the
central council.

The number of members is increased from
forty to sixty, the idea being to give the
various central divisions greater representation, and, naturally, more authority.
In the main, these are the changes that
are proposed to the Canadian Red Cross
Society Act as it now exists.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Can the honourable gentleman tell us what is the annual value of the
society's asset?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am sorry that I
cannot answer that question. As a matter of
fact, it is less than 20 minutes since I was
asked to handle the bill, and there are many
points on which I have not been able to get
information. I was very happy to be given
the opportunity of sponsoring the bill in
the Senate, not only because of the great
service that the society has long been rendering throughout this country, but particularly
because of the relief work that it did after
two recent floods in the province of British
Columbia-one, during the present session
of parliament; and the other, two years ago.
The honourable gentleman asks what is
the annual value of the property held by
the society. I presume it is the permissible
limit of $100,000, though I do not know. I
regret very much that I cannot answer the
question.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Paterson: If it has been previously considered wise to have a limita-

tion of $100,000 on the annual value of real
estate which the society may hold, does the
honourable gentleman feel that it would be
a good thing to remove that ceiling now?
Hon. Jacob Nicol: Honourable senators, I
am quite in accord with the general purpose
of the bill, but, if I judge correctly, the public
is not well informed as to what the society
does. The amendment to legalize the use of
La Société

canadienne de

la

Croix-Rouge

as the society's name in the French language
is proper and necessary, for unless the French
name is specified in the statute the English
name is the only one that may be correctly
used in documents or articles that, apart from
the name, are written in French.
But the question just raised by the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) is important. Section 1 of the bill
seeks to repeal the provision in the present
law which restricts the annual income of
the society from its property holdings to
$100,000. The property held under this limitation may of course be worth several million
dollars. I believe that in the society's own
interest some limitation should be maintained,
in order that the public may have at least
a rough idea of the value of the real estate
holdings. I think the society has made a
mistake in not keeping the people well
informed as to its assets and its work. With
other senators I recognize that lately it has
been doing effective work which has caught
the public eye and done much to regain public
support. Nothwithstanding that, I think the
proposal now before us is a mistake.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I be allowed to correct the impression of the honourable gentleman? It is real estate value of not more than
$100,000, and not income, to which the bill
refers.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I am grateful to the honourable senator for correcting me. The honourable senator who proposed the bill used the
word "income", and as copies of the bill are
not before us I took that to be the provision.
I cannot see that the society's income has
been $100,000 for years. I am told that its
assets now exceed $10 million.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is real estate
value.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I call the attention of
honourable senators to subsection 2 of section
5 of the Act, which reads:
The annual value of the real estate in Canada by
or in trust for the Society shall not exceed one
hundred thousand dollars.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: Then my impression was

correct.

Hon. Mr. Gouin: I would say that "value"

and "income" are synonomous.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They are the same thing.
Hon.

Mr.

Turgeon:

The

section

to

be

repealed, and which I thought I read, is as
follows:
The annual value of real estate held in Canada by
or in trust for the Society shall not exceed one
hundred thousand dollars.

If I made a mistake and used the word
"income", I ask for the privilege of substi-

tuting therefor the word "value".
Hon. Mr. Leger: I do not think it makes
much difference, because annual value means
income.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I am sorryHon. Mr. Leger: My friend can be as sorry
as much as he wishes, but I would point out
to him that the expression "annual value"
means income or revenue from real estate.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: It means the value year
by year, and the bill provides that the value
of the society's real estate shall not be in
excess of $100,000.
Hon. Mr. Leger: It means the annual
revenue from real estate shall not exceed so
much. That is the meaning of the expression
in all statutes.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, a
great many contributors to the Red Cross
Society were perfectly satisfied with the disposition of funds during the war years, but
have not been satisfied with their disposal in
peacetime. This would appear to be a splendid opportunity to have the Red Cross officials
appear before a committee and make some
explanation of the disposal of the society's
funds. I am told that in one campaign they
went out for $6 million and collected $11
million, and on another occasion asked for
$10 million and received $24 million. As I
say, a great many people want a better
explanation of the disposition of funds, and
a proper annual report of reserves.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I ask if the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay would be
satisfied if the bill carried, and at the next
session of Parliament there was a full inquiry
into the matters he has mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: That is quite satisfactory provided my honourable friend will
undertake that there will be such an inquiry
next session.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I will undertake to bring
the matter up.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is it vital that this bill
be passed at the present session?

DECEMBER 10, 1949
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I think so. Certainly
the society believes that it is necessary. There
is the change of name and Newfoundland to
be considered.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I agree with the remarks
of the senator from Thunder Bay, that a committee of this chamber could very well inquire
into and throw some light on the expenditures of the society. Generally speaking, I
think the work of the Red Cross Society is
very laudable; but I am not so certain that
it is not more efficient at collecting money
than it is at spending it.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I am quite willing to vote
for the bill as it is, but I think that the
point made by the honourable senator from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) was well taken.
The interests of the society would have been
better served had they inserted a limit to
the net annual value of the real estate.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I suggest that an
inquiry next session could settle that matter
definitely.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: It seems to me that if we
leave the matter as it is, without a limit, it
will be a long time before the society will
come before us again. They could carry on
for years; they do not need any money; and
how can the subject come before parliament
again unless there is a bill?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If the Senate so wishes,
the bill could now go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I suggest that the
debate be suspended until this afternoon,
and in the meantime the honourable senator
from Cariboo can make some inquiries.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If that is satisfactory
to the Senate, I shall be glad to do as the
honourable member suggests.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I move the adjournment
of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That means, adjournment until later today, not necessarily to
another sitting?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is so. Under
the circumstances I suggest that the Senate
adjourn during pleasure, to re-assemble at
the call of the bell. The rate of progress in
the other place indicates that it will not be
necessary to return before 3 o'clock this
afternoon. Perhaps by that time the honourable senator from Cariboo will have secured
the additional information which has been
asked for, and we could then proceed with
the consideration of this bill and take whatever further action may be deemed desirable
in the light of circumstances at ihat time.

The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when the Senate adjourned during
pleasure this morning there was a motion
before the house for the second reading of
Bill 222, intituled an Act to amend The
Canadian Red Cross Society Act. The debate
on the said motion was adjourned until a
later stage of this sitting.
When the bill was introduced, the impression was that it was a public bill introduced
by a private member. It has now been
established that it is not a public bill but
a private bill, and should be dealt with as
such. Various rules have been suspended
for the purpose of advancing legislation in
the Senate, but these apply only to public
bills. This being a private bill, I would call
the attention of the Senate to rule 118, which
states:
Any private bill from the House of Commons for
which no petition bas been received by the Senate,
shall be taken into consideration and reported on
by the Committee on Standing Orders in like manner
as a petition, after the first reading of such bill,
and before its consideration by any other Standing
Committee.

In order now to proceed with this bill, it
will be necessary for the honourable senator
who moved the second reading (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) to withdraw his motion. He may
then move, with the unanimous consent of
the Senate, that all rules respecting private
bills be suspended in so far as they relate
to Bill 222, intituled an Act to amend The
Canadian Red Cross Society Act. It will
then be in order for him to move the second
reading of the bill, and if it is desired, it
may, after being given second reading, be
referred to a Standing Committee of the
Senate or to a committee of the whole.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
beg leave to withdraw my motion for the
second reading of Bill 222.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, has the honourable senator the leave of
the Senate to withdraw his motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The motion for second reading was withdrawn.
SUSPENSION OF RULES

Hon. Mr. Turgeon moved with leave of the

Senate: That all rules respecting private bills
be suspended in so far as they relate to Bill
222, intituled an Act to amend the Canadian
Red Cross Society Act.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators: The bill contains four sections, and at our morning sitting opposition was expressed to only the
flrst one, which would repeal the existing
provision that limits the annual value of the
real estate held in Canada by or in trust for
the society to $100,000. I understand that
unanimous consent is required in order to pass
my motion. If this is given and the bill is read
a second time and referred to committee, I
shall move in committee that section 1 of the
bill be stricken out. Elimination of this section would mean that the society, if it wishes
a widening of the limitation on the annual
value of its real estate holdings, will be
required to have a bill presented to parliament at another session, and-as was pointed
out this morning by the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
-if
another bill does corne before us it can
be considered in committee in the usual way.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
have the honour to second the motion for
suspension of the rules.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I do not object to the request for
unanimous consent to the waiving of rules
governing private bills, but I think I should
in all fairness point out that included among
these rules would be No. 107, which provides:
All applications to parlianent for private bill of
ainy nature whatsoever shall be advertised by notice
pubhished in the Canada GaZettc.

The bill was not so advertised. and if we
pass the motion we waive that requirement.
Because of the nature of the bill and the
explanation by the sponsor (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
that he will move for the elimination of section 1, I am not objecting to the suspension
of the rules, but I am bound to say that I hope
this will not be -regarded as a precedent. I
think that every private bill presented to parliament should conform to the rules regarding
publication, rules which have been carefully
prepared and have a definite purpose.
Hon. Mr. Marcoite: May I ask the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
who sponsored this bill, whether any harm
would be done to the Red Cross Society if

consideration were postponed until the next
session of Parliament?
This morning the
honourable gentleman said that when we
reconvene in a couple of months he would
undertake to bring up the subject, so that it
could be referred to a committee of the house.
Nobody has contributed more service to this
country than the Red Cross Society, and I
would be the last man to oppose any measure

of assistance to it. But the honourable leader
of the government has just expressed the hope
that our present procedure will not create a

precedent.

If no harm will result, why should

we not postpone the consideration of the bill
to the next session?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I may say that since we
adjourned this morning I asked that same
question, and was told that the society is most
anxious that the provisions relating to membership in the Central Council-which affects
Newfoundland-and to the French version of
the name of the Society, be left in the bill.
Of course the society is interested also in
the passage of the subsection dealing with
land values. I took the liberty of pointing
out to the society representatives, the opposition which had been expressed, and my

undertaking to the honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) to move
at the next session that the subject matter of
the bill be considered before a committee.
If the section dealing with land values
fails to pass, I feel that the bill will be before
us next session, and will then comply with
the rules of this honourable body.
I wish to acknowledge the courtesy of the
leader of the government in

consenting to

the consideration of this bill, but I would
call the attention of the house to the fact
that this bill is no ordinary private bill,
initiated in the Senate, but one which cornes
to us after passing through the other house.

I would much appreciate unanimous agreement to consider the measure now.

Hon. Mr. Golding: May I ask the honourable senator if the society gave any reason
for bringing this measure before the house
at such a late date? Surely it knows of the
parliamentary rules and regulations governing such matters.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I have already mentioned, I think, that I knew nothing about
the matter until a quarter to eleven this
morning. I did some long-distance telephoning and learned that the Society particularly
wanted the passage of the sections dealing
with land values and the French name of the

Society. There is the further section of the
bill relating to the Central Council and
Executive Committee.

That will be important

to them because of the extension of their
work. I did not ask why they had waited so
long: I do not know how long this bill was
before the other house; as the honourable
the Speaker has pointed out, it came before us
somewhat in the guise of a publie rather than
a private bill.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Speaking on the motion
for suspension of the rules, I must express
my opinion that if there is any legislation in
respect of which the rules should be observed,
it is a bill of this kind. A very large number
of people all over the country are interested
in this society, and the public in general

DECEMBER 10, 1949
should have been notified that the bill was
being brought forward. But, as the leader of
the government has just stated, no kind of
notice was given. From one end of the country to the other the public has responded
very generously to appeals to subscribe to
the Canadian Red Cross Society. We are
now called upon to amend certain of the
society's powers entirely, without the participation of the public, unless it may be said
that we represent the public. As a rule, when
a private bill is submitted, the public has the
right to be represented; and although there
have been many instances in another place
where a suspension of rules similar to that
now requested has been granted, someone
representing the public has been present to
concur in the suspension. It might be well
to postpone action and give notice through
the press of what we are doing, and that the
bill will be taken up again at a specified date,
when representations from the public would
be received.
I do not wish to delay the house or to do
anything which might be obnoxious to those
who are sponsoring the bill, so I am prepared to consent to a suspension of the rules,
but I am opposed to section 2. From what
has been said here I gather that that clause,
which changes the mode of governing the
society, is regarded as important. Who is
interested in this amendment? The public.
Yet we are asked to allow those who now
govern the society to alter its constitution
in such a way as to confer upon themselves
authority to continue in office. If the society
desires this amendment, it should notify the
public of what it is doing, and should secure
not only our ratification but the approval of
public opinion, without which no society can
efficiently operate.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question is on
the motion of the honourable Senator Turgeon:
That all rules respecting private bills be suspended in so far as they relate to the Bill 222, an
Act to amend The Canadian Red Cross Society Act.

I must again warn this honourable house
that consent must be unanimous. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the rules
were suspended.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Turgeon moved the second reading
of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I took some
time this morning to explain the bill and the
objects of the proposed amendments. I shall
not repeat the explanation. If in its wisdom
the Senate sees fit to give second reading to
the bill, I shall move that it be referred to
45785-33

the Committee of the Whole. Then I shall
move for the elimination of the section dealing with the annual value of the real estate
which may be held by the Association, and
honourable senators may deal with my proposal as they see fit. Once again I want to
thank honourable senators for the kind and
courteous manner in which they have dealt
with this legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, the Senate
went in committee on the bill.
Hon. Mr. Fogo in the Chair.
On section 1-repeal of subsection 2 of
section 5:
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Mr. Chairman, I move
that clause 1 of the bill be struck out.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I second the motion.
The section was rejected.
On section 2-central council; executive
committee; quorum:
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Honourable senators, this
section would enable the central council to
enlarge the number of its members and change
the society's constitution without further
reference to parliament in future. I think
this would be against public interest. I would
have approved of an amendment to section 1
so as to permit the society to hold real estate
up to an annual value of $200,000, but I
think section 2 should be stricken out. I do
not wish to appear unkind to the Canadian
Red Cross Society, for we all know of the
good work it has done, and I think I am not
being unfair when I say that the public is
dissatisfied because it has not been given the
information to which it is entitled.
The introduction of the bill at this late
hour, without notice, indicates to my mind
the attitude of those who are now carrying
on the society's affairs. In the governing
body there are a number of well-known men.
They are familiar with parliamentary rules
and are aware that the public is interested
in what the society is doing, so there must
have been a reason for the procedure they
chose to adopt. I do not think we should
encourage those people to act in this way.
Let them realize that they will be required
to follow parliamentary rules, and that they
cannot have a bill considered until after
proper notice of it has been given. I might
add that I see no objection to section 3, for
that merely legalizes the French name of
the society.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Honourable senators,
the very foundation of the success of the
Red Cross Society is voluntary service by the
organization's supporters. As to the proposal
for removing the restriction on the value of
the society's real estate holdings, we should
remember that no company is ever granted
a charter entitling it to an unlimited capitalization. I find it difficult to understand why
a bill containing such a proposal as this
should have been presented to parliament
at all.
The Hon. ihe Chairman: Does the honourable gentleman appreciate that in striking
out section 1 of the bill we have dealt with
the proposal to remove the limitation on the
value of the real estate holdings?
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: I do appreciate that,
Mr. Chairman. What I have been saying is
really an aside to the remarks that I wish
to make on section 2, which would empower
the central council to increase the number
of its members to sixty, although five members would still constitute a quorum of the
executive committee. Passage of this section
would make possible the giving of decisions
>n very important matters by a mere handful
of representatives of the great contributing
public of Canada.
I heartily agree with what was said by the
senator who immediately preceded me (Hon.
Mr. Nicol). I think we should pass only the
third section, which specifles what the name
of the society shall be in the French language,
and that the other two sections should be
rejected. If the society's officers wish to have
those two sections introduced at another
session, let them come here prepared to give
information that should be given, in the
public interest.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I find it difficult to disassociate myself from
the position of, leader of the government in
the consideration of a private bill. Though
I am in sympathy with the difficulties in
which the sponsor finds himiself, it seems
to me if there is any question at all of the
unanimity of the house on this matter, he
should accede to the suggestion made by the
honourable senators who have just spoken.
I of course do not wish to handicap in any
way the work of the society, but it would
seem that no serious harm will result if this
suggestion is followed. I feel that it might
be in the interest of the society-the very
foundation of which is public confidence-to
allow the matter to stand.
I realize the
responsibility that places upon the honourable gentleman who has sponsored the bill,
but I offer the suggestion for what it may
be worth.

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I of course realize that this bill is under
discussion now only through the courtesy
of every member of the house. In view of
the objections raised by the honourable
senators from Wellington South (Hon. Mr.
Gladstone)
and Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr.
Golding), and the suggestion made by the
honourable leader of the house, I wish now,
in fairness to the association, to put on the
record the reasons behind the section dealing
with the Central Council and the Executive
Committee. The explanatory note on the
constitution of the Central Council reads:
This amendment is required generally to give
increased representation on the governing body of
the Society to the various provincial divisions,
including the new province of Newfoundland.

On the constitution of the Executive
Committee there is this explanatory note:
The purpose of this amendment is to remove the
limitation on the number of members of the Executive Committee in view of the increase in the
maximum nunber of members of the Central
Council.

With that explanation on the record, and
bearing in mind that the house will meet
again within two months, I offer no objection to the deletion of this section, and would
move that section 2 of the bill be struck out.
Section 2 was rejected.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The bill was reported, as amended.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Turgeon moved the third reading of the bill, as amended.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill,
as amended, was read the third time, and
passed.
The Senate

At eight o'clock the sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 7
FIRST READING

A message was received from the house of
Commons with Bill 224, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1950.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, Ihis is the
seventh appronriation bill to come before us

DECEMBER 10, 1949

since last March. The six previous bills
granted interim supply, to allow the government to carry on the public service for the
present financial year until such time as the
estimates could be passed and the final supply
bill put through parliament. The bill now
before us grants $505,015,801.77, the amount
that the government estimates will be
required for the remainder of the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1950. The estimates, supplementary estimates (Newfoundland), and
further supplementary estimates No's. 1 and 2,
tabled in this house, show that the government
will need a total of $2,467,601,849 for the
public service this year. Of this sum $984,293,691 is already provided for in existing
statutes. Family allowances and public debt
charges, together with some other items, are
provided for in this way. This leaves the
sum of $1,483,308,158 that is not otherwise
provided for, and which parliament has been
asked to appropriate. The six previous bills
that were before us appropriated $978,292,356.23 of this amount, leaving $505,015,801
unprovided for. The purpose of the present
bill is to make provision for this final sum.
Section 2 of the bill would grant $440,983,724.09. This represents the amount of
the main estimates not already voted by the
previous bills. These estimates are found in
schedule A of this bill.
Section 3 provides $7,485,744.34. This represents the amount of supplementary estimates
(Newfoundland) that have not already been
voted. These estimates may be found in
schedule B.
Section 4 would vote the remaining amounts
of the further supplementary estimates Nos.
1 and 2, which estimates are set out in schedule C. The sum of these is $56,546,333.34. The
total of the amounts mentioned in sections
2, 3 and 4 is $505,015,801.77, which is the
entire amount covered by this bill.
Section 5 authorizes the Governor in
Council to borrow up to $200 million in addition to what may be borrowed under powers
given by the Consolidated Revenue and Audit
Act, 1931. These sums so borrowed could be
used for public works and general purposes,
and the payment and redemption of treasury
bills and Dominion of Canada deposit certificates that may mature from time to time.
Section 6 provides for the accounting of
the money spent under the authorization of
the bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Is this a complete summary of all the expenditures, including those
for national defence?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, it includes all the
estimates and represents the specific balance
of the total estimates, that is the balance after
45785-331

what has already been granted by the various
interim supply bills that have been passed
from time to time.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
know of course that the Senate cannot
increase the amount granted by a supply bill,
but our inability in that respect does not prevent us from making some comments on
money votes. I should like it understood that
my few remarks will represent my own
personal ideas. In these estimates there is
something like $400 million for national
defence.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The actual figure is
$382 million.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The thing that we
Canadians should be concerned to ask in this
day and age is why that is necessary. A few
weeks ago the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) was properly
annoyed because the press had failed to give
any publicity to the statement of the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that a possible solution of the difficulties now facing all countries was to be found
in "a moral, religious or spiritual revival
among all the peoples of the world, with a
real appreciation of the brotherhood of man

and the need for living together in peace and
harmony". Just imagine what a country like
Canada might accomplish if it spent $400
million on m-issionary work rather than on
national defence.
I am somewhat concerned about this question. Personally I cannot see that the expenditure of this large sum of money will be of
any avail at all. What we ought to try to
ensure is that the conduct of this country's
affairs is unanimously approved by the people.
It is of the greatest importance that in the
event of a national emergency there should
be in this country no fifth column or any
group of people who would not, either by
service in the armed forces or in some other
way, support the democratic system as we
know it.
I recently made a trip to Fort St. John
in the Peace River district, where the
National Defence Department was carrying
on Exercise Eagle. Well, honourable senators, I do not know whether that operation
served any useful purpose, but the older
Indians in that country, who remembered
the strategy employed in their early battles,
were laughing at the whole procedure. They
did not think our forces could take one
teepee. I was reminded of the remark of
Wellington, quoted recently by the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), and if I may apply it 10 Exercise

SENATE
Eagle, I would say that I do not know what
the "enemy" thought of our forces, "but, by
God, they frightened me."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner:
I am making these
rernarks tonight nnly to impress upon
honourable senators the fact that no one in
Canada wishes for anything but peace. With
that attitude on our part, it is a sad thing
that we have to spend almost $400 million
for national defence. It is interesting to note
that when I first came to this house Canada's
national budget by taxation was approximately $400 million.
When I hear young people say, as I often
do, that the rich man wants war so that he
can make money, I ask them, "What on earth
are you talking about? Farmers' prices were
high in wartime. Would it be fair to say
that they want war? The rich man is the
one who often has everything taken away
during the war, so why should he want anything but peace?"
When we return to our constituencies,
honourable senators, our aim should be
towards finding some means by which the
present expenditure for national defence
may be lessened. We should emphasize the
fact throughout Canada that no one should
have any fear of our ambitions or intentions. All we want to do is defend ourselves,
if necessary. I realize that we are associated
with other nations in our defence program,
and that to a large extent our expenditures
are necessary because of that relationship.
I repeat the sentiment so often expressed by
the late Mr. Woodsworth, that they who take
the sword will perish by the sword. Some
of our concern for defence may be attributable to the fact that at the outbreak of the
recent war other nations pointed to our
unpreparedness. But I think it should be
the aim of every responsible person in
Canada to hasten the day when our expenditures for defence will be reduced.
Just
imagine what $400 million would do for
Canada if spent in other ways!
Not one
dollar of the expenditure for national
defence will be of any permanent use to
this country.
My purpose in speaking this evening is
to express the hope that we shall soon
advance to a point where such outlays will
not be necessary, and to urge diplomats
everywhere to work for peace throughout
the world.
I hope that Canada and all
other countries will soon be able to turn
their resources to much better use than
preparation for war.

After which the Right Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
to close the First Session of the Twenty-first
Parliarnent of Canada with the following
Speech:

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since the opening of the present session of parliament you have approved measures required for the
discharge of the constitutional responsibilities of
our nationhood. As a result the Supreme Court of
Canada will shortly become the final court of appeal
for Canada.
In response to your address the parliament of
the United Kingdom has amended the British
North America Act to vest in the Parliament of
Canada the power to make amendments to the constitution of Canada in matters which are exclusively
of federal concern.
Early in the New Year a conference with representatives of the provincial governments will be
held for the purpose of working out a satisfactory
procedure for making within Canada such other
amendments to the constitution as may from time to
time be required.
Our country continues to take an active part in
the proceedings of the United Nations.
Despite
that organization's present inability to solve the
major political problem confronting mankind, the
United Nations has succeeded in coping with
menacing situations in many parts of the world.
At the current session of the General Assembly,
Canada was elected to the Economie and Social
Council.
It is gratifying that the agencies under the North
Atlantic Treaty have been established and are
undertaking the tasks which have been assigned to
them.
